# A Twitter bot that tweets AI generated poetry

The *Transformer* model from [*All you need is attention*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) is used. We loosely follow the tensorflow tutorial [Transformer model for language understanding](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/transformer) to build the generator. The tutorial is adapted for text generation rather than translation and translated to PyTorch. 

Thankfully, Twitter has maintained its API and we can make use of that to deliver our poetry to the world.
