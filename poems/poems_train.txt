 adam ate an apple it got stuck in his throat and they called him eve the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness adam ate an apple choked on it so hard a rib popped out of his chest and they called it eve the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness it takes the hacking of a body to make a woman adam hacking up a piece of his body it was just a piece of fruit they called me fruit once too they called me fruity before they called me flaming before they called me faggot before they called me woman i thought i would have to hack this body into pieces woman a name stuck in my throat right under the apple adam tried to eat choked on it for years waited for my ribs to pop out my chest to explode for my eve to be created from the fruit i couldn’t swallow they called me fruit once until they called me woman and then they just called me fruitless as if it took a womb to be progenitor creator mother of all things strength and fortitude and sadness they reckon god looked at the image of herself and called it adam they still don’t call me woman they still don’t birth me eve even though they cast me out my throat shrunken close with the fruit still stuck in it like adam before they called him eve and suddenly i am a stranger to eden i am a stranger to this body as if it hadn’t always been mine i reckon god looked at the image of herself and called it me but i don’t know if that was before or after the apple before or after adam choked which came first the progenitor or the mother the apple or the rib the strength or the sadness this body was god’s original creation but they called it sin they called it adam i reckon god looked at the image of  herself and called adam eve after she choked on his name some fruit that bloomed in everyone else’s throat but she could never quite swallow the fall of man was an apple hacked up from a fruitless body a woman learning what evil was like a man forcing his name upon you the fall of man was a rib being torn from a chest and men calling that violence holy naming a woman based only on the body parts she’s made of the fall of man was the beginning of eve eve casting out adam’s name eve discovering who she was the progenitor the creator of all things the mother of strength and fortitude and sadness the fall of man was eve becoming a woman with or without eden’s approval and now every time someone tries to call her adam tries to force the apple of his name down her throat she laughs she swallows she looks at god herself and she smiles

 the best job i had was moving a stone from one side of the road to the other this required a permit which required a bribe the bribe took all my salary yet because i hadn’t finished the job i had no salary and to pay the bribe i took a job moving the stone the other way because the official wanted his bribe he gave me a permit for the second job when i pointed out that the work would be best completed if i did nothing he complimented my brain and wrote a letter to my employer suggesting promotion on stationery bearing the wings of a raptor spread in flight over a mountain smaller than the bird my boss fearing my intelligence paid me to sleep on the sofa and take lunch with the official who required a bribe to keep anything from being done when i told my parents they wrote my brother to come home from university to be slapped on the back of the head dutifully he arrived and bowed to receive his instruction at which point sense entered his body and he asked what i could do by way of a job i pointed out there were stones everywhere trying not to move all it took was a little gumption to be the man who didn’t move them it was harder to explain the intricacies of not obtaining a permit to not do this just yesterday he got up at dawn and shaved as if the lack of hair on his face has anything to do with the appearance of food on an empty table

 1   i am a great american i am almost nationalistic about it i love america like a madness but i am afraid to return to america i’m even afraid to go into the american express   2   they are frankensteining christ in america in their sunday campaigns they are putting the fear of christ in america under their tents in their sunday campaigns they are driving old ladies mad with christ in america they are televising the gift of healing and the fear of hell in america under their tents in their sunday campaigns they are leaving their tents and are bringing their christ to the stadiums of america in their sunday campaigns they are asking for a full house an all get out for their christ in the stadiums of america they are getting them in their sunday and saturday campaigns they are asking them to come forward and fall on their knees because they are all guilty and they are coming forward in guilt and are falling on their knees weeping their guilt begging to be saved o lord o lord in their monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday campaigns   3   it is a time in which no man is extremely wondrous it is a time in which rock stupidity outsteps the 5th column as the sole enemy in america it is a time in which ignorance is a good americun ignorance is excused only where it is so it is not so in america man is not guilty   christ is not to be feared i am telling you the american way is a hideous monster eating christ   making him into oreos and dr pepper the sacrament of its foul mouth i am telling you the devil is impersonating christ in america america’s educators amp preachers are the mentaldictators of false intelligence   they will not allow america to be smart they will only allow death to make america smart educators amp communicators are the lackeys of the american way they enslave the minds of the young and the young are willing slaves but not for long because who is to doubt the american way is not the way the duty of these educators is no different than the duty of a factory foreman replica production   make all the young think alike dress alike   believe alike   do alike togetherness   this is the american way the few great educators in america are weak amp helpless they abide   and so uphold the american way wars have seen such men   they who despised things about them but did nothing   and they are the most dangerous dangerous because their intelligence is not denied and so give faith to the young who rightfully believe in their intelligence smoke this cigarette doctors smoke this cigarette and doctors know  educators know   but they dare not speak their know the victory that is man is made sad in this fix youth can only know the victory of being born all else is stemmed   until death be the final victory and a merciful one at that if america falls it will be the blame of its educators preachers   communicators   alike america today is america’s greatest threat we are old when we are young america is always new   the world is always new the meaning of the world is birth not death growth gone in the wrong direction the true direction grows ever young in this direction what grows grows old a strange mistake   a strange and sad mistake for it has grown into an old thing while all else around it is new rockets will not make it any younger and what made america decide to grow i do not know   i can only hold it to the strangeness in man and america has grown into the american way to be young is to be ever purposeful   limitless to grow is to know limit   purposelessness each age is a new age how outrageous it is that something old and sad from the preage incorporates each new age do i say the declaration of independence is old yes i say what was good for 1789 is not good for 1960 it was right and new to say all men were created equal because it was a light then but today it is tragic to say it today it should be fact man has been on earth a long time one would think with his mania for growth he would by now have outgrown such things as constitutions manifestos codes commandments that he could well live in the world without them and know instinctively how to live and be for what is being but the facility to love was not that the true goal of growth love was not that christ but man is strange and grows where he will and chalks it all up to fate   whatever be america rings with such strangeness it has grown into something strange and the american is good example of this mad growth the boy man   big baby meat as though the womb were turned backwards giving birth to an old man the victory that is man does not allow man to top off his empirical achievement with death the aztecs did it by yanking out young hearts at the height of their power the americans are doing it by feeding their young to the way for it was not the spaniard who killed the aztec but the aztec who killed the aztec rome is proof   greece is proof   all history is proof victory does not allow degeneracy it will not be the communists will kill america no   but america itself the american way   that sad mad process is not run by any one man or organization it is a monster born of itself   existing of its self the men who are employed by this monster are employed unknowingly they reside in the higher echelons of intelligence they are the educators the psychiatrists the ministers the writers the politicians the communicators the rich the entertainment world and some follow and sing the way because they sincerely believe it to be good and some believe it holy and become minutemen in it some are in it simply to be in and most are in it for gold they do not see the way as monster they see it as the “good life” what is the way the way was born out of the american dream a nightmare the state of americans today compared to the americans of the 18th century proves the nightmare not franklin not jefferson who speaks for america today but strange rednecked men of industry and the goofs of show business bizarre frightening the mickey mouse sits on the throne and hollywood has a vast supply could grammar school youth seriously look upon a picture of george washington and “herman borst” the famous night club comedian together at valley forge old old and decadent   gone the dignity the american sun seems headed for the grave o that youth might raise it anew the future depends solely on the young the future is the property of the young what the young know the future will know what they are and do the future will be and do what has been done must not be done again will the american way allow this no i see in every american express and in every army center in europe i see the same face the same sound of voice the same clothes the same walk i see mothers amp fathers no difference among them replicas they not only speak and walk and think alike they have the same face what did this monstrous thing what regiments a people so how strange is nature’s play on america surely were lincoln alive today he could never be voted president   not with his looks indeed americans are babies all in the embrace of mama way did not ike when he visited the american embassy in paris a year ago say to the staff“everything is fine just drink coca cola and everything will be all right” this is true and is on record did not american advertising call for togetherness not orgiasticly like today’s call nor as means to stem violence this is true and is on record are not the army centers in europe ghettos they are and o how sad   how lost the px newsstands are filled with comic books the army movies are always doris day what makes a people huddle so why can’t they be universal who has smalled them so this is serious i do not mock or hate this i can only sense some mad vast conspiracy helplessness is all it is they are caught   caught in the way and those who seek to get out of the way can not the beats are good example of this they forsake the way’s habits and acquire for themselves their own habits and they become as distinct and regimented and lost as the main flow because the way has many outlets like a snake of many tentacles there is no getting out of the way the only way out is the death of the way and what will kill the way but a new consciousness something great and new and wonderful must happen to free man from this beast it is a beast we can not see or even understand for it be the condition of our minds god how close to science fiction it all seems as if some power from another planet incorporated itself in the minds of us all it could well be for as i live i swear america does not seem like america to me  americans are a great people i ask for some great and wondrous event that will free them from the way and make them a glorious purposeful people once again i do not know if that event is due   deserved or even possible i can only hold that man is the victory of life and i hold firm to american man  i see standing on the skin of the way america   to be as proud and victorious as st michael on the neck of the fallen lucifer

 there is ghazal swimming inside of her wanting to be born on the matter of foretelling of small miracles cactus flowers in bloom on this city fire escape where inside your tongue touches every inch of her skin where you lay your hand on her belly and sleep here she fingers the ornate remains of ancient mosques here some mythic angel will rise from the dust of ancestors’ bones this is where you shall worship at the intersections of distilled deities and memory’s sharp edges the country is quite a poetic place water and rock contain verse and metaphor even wild grasses reply in rhyme you are not broken she knows this having captured a moment of lucidity summer lightning bugs sun’s rays in a jelly jar  this is not a love poem but a cove to escape the flux however momentary she is still a child confabulating the fantastic please do not erode her wonder for the liquid that is your language there is thunderstorm in her chest wanting to burst through her skin this is neither love poem nor plea this is not river nor stone

 he sits beside his wife who takes the wheel clutching coupons he wanders the aisles of stop amp save  there’s no place he must be no clock to punch  sure there are bass in the lake a balsa model in the garage the parthree back nine but it’s not the same time the enemy then the enemy now  as he points the remote at the screen or pauses at the window staring into the neighbor’s fence but not really seeing it he listens to his wife in the kitchen more amazed than everhow women seem to know what to do  how with their cycles and timers their rolling boils and threeminute eggs they wait for something to start  or stop

 august is the cruelest month never enough daylight too much heat no holidays and nothing matters except september’s  dawning responsibilities but the august of 1994 i was holden caulfield summer camp senior counselor for the junior trail  blazers black and brown children two weeks shy of first second and third grade nothing is as positive as motivating a force within  one’s life as a school bus full of kids singing along to the local radio station blazing hiphop and rampb imagine this cherubic  chorus riding upstate to ini kamoze’s “here comes the hotstepper” “muuurderah” my workday is filled with hazards like chocolate  melted sticky swim trunk pockets insistent sunburn and the assorted rah rah of parental unsupervision but those bus rides back from  upstate water parks and pools were my favorite times working have you ever ridden in a cheesebus with ashy children asleep  against you staring at sudden trees  more numerous than project windows  blurring along the highways like confusion giving way  to doubt the heady smell of dried chlorine and musty towels lulling you into the soft timbre of a midwest falsetto tell me  what it is to fall in love with a lightskin girl covering the isley brothers i was not two weeks into 21 years old i had yet  to wear a box cutter in my fifth pocket or see a semiautomatic aimed at my center mass to feel its dumbness against my spine  my life was uncertain save for its unlikely length under my control like the pilot who falls short of what he says what he says  he’s all about all about all my homeboys were still alive just like aaliyah dana haughton not yet an angel of the cruelest august  begging a boy who may not be in the mood to learn what he thinks he knows to look beyond his world and try to find a place for her

 they swing across the screen in brave array long british columns grinding the dark grass twelve months ago they marched into the grey of battle yet again behold them pass  one lifts his dusty cap his hair is bright i meet his eyes eager and young and bold the picture quivers into ghostly white then i remember and my heart grows cold

 this is the song of the mud the pale yellow glistening mud that covers the hills like satin the grey gleaming silvery mud that is spread like enamel over the valleys the frothing squirting spurting liquid mud that gurgles along the road beds the thick elastic mud that is kneaded and pounded and squeezed under the hoofs of the horses the invincible inexhaustible mud of the war zone   this is the song of the mud the uniform of the poilu his coat is of mud his great dragging flapping coat that is too big for him and too heavy his coat that once was blue and now is grey and stiff with the mud that cakes to it this is the mud that clothes him his trousers and boots are of mud and his skin is of mud and there is mud in his beard his head is crowned with a helmet of mud he wears it well he wears it as a king wears the ermine that bores him he has set a new style in clothing he has introduced the chic of mud   this is the song of the mud that wriggles its way into battle the impertinent the intrusive the ubiquitous the unwelcome the slimy inveterate nuisance that fills the trenches that mixes in with the food of the soldiers that spoils the working of motors and crawls into their secret parts that spreads itself over the guns that sucks the guns down and holds them fast in its slimy voluminous lips that has no respect for destruction and muzzles the bursting shells and slowly softly easily soaks up the fire the noise soaks up the energy and the courage soaks up the power of armies soaks up the battle just soaks it up and thus stops it   this is the hymn of mudthe obscene the filthy the putrid the vast liquid grave of our armies it has drowned our men its monstrous distended belly reeks with the undigested dead our men have gone into it sinking slowly and struggling and slowly disappearing our fine men our brave strong young men our glowing red shouting brawny men slowly inch by inch they have gone down into it into its darkness its thickness its silence slowly irresistibly it drew them down sucked them down and they were drowned in thick bitter heaving mud now it hides them oh so many of them under its smooth glistening surface it is hiding them blandly there is not a trace of them there is no mark where they went down the mute enormous mouth of the mud has closed over them   this is the song of the mud the beautiful glistening golden mud that covers the hills like satin the mysterious gleaming silvery mud that is spread like enamel over the valleys mud the disguise of the war zone mud the mantle of battles mud the smooth fluid grave of our soldiers this is the song of the mud

 this is the field where the battle did not happen where the unknown soldier did not die this is the field where grass joined hands where no monument stands and the only heroic thing is the sky  birds fly here without any sound unfolding their wings across the open no people killedor were killedon this ground hallowed by neglect and an air so tame that people celebrate it by forgetting its name

 it struck them both as strange although each pond and lake clear to the coast was locked in ice no open water the imperious wind kept pushing waterfowl inland that night a winter moon stood high and pierced the thin clouds’ vapors so the boy could contemplate their emptiness inside relentless the flocks flew westward the border collie whimpered putting his forepaws now on one sill now another as if some odd creature circled the house this lifetime later a man he looks back on that stay at her farm its details clear their meanings still vague his grandmother called it wrong as well that the weather should be so frigid even in such a gale as a rule this kind of cold needed calm he sees the fire  the dazzle of sparks when she loaded a log what seemed most amiss was how the old woman’s house no longer felt safe that visit he wanted and did not want to know what the dog might know he tried to picture the menace outdoors he longed to shape it so that he might name it and after these many miles to now away from the ruby glow of the metal parlor stove from that blueeyed collie from the woman he so admires and loves recalling that night after so much time he still believes that to name a thing is to tame it or at least to feel less bewildered not death for instance but the deaths of al and virginia his parents not the abstract legalismdivorce but the disappearance of my sweet wife sarah run off with that california lawyer  not simply alone but i have no children was that the wail of geese coming down the stovepipe if so it would be a marvel but he knew it wasn’t the caterwaul from the barn was alarming and more than it might have been had grandma herself not startled after which she put on her late large husband’s threaded farming coveralls outside her housedress which rode up and made a lumpy sash she stepped out under cloud and bird he would not follow rather he stood indoors to wait until she came stomping her boots through puddled barnyard holes like a child herself kicking ice shards to scuttle along like beads from a broken bracelet no matter the world had gone wrong violent and void at once she saidthe mare has foaled  on tiptoe she read the mercury out the kitchen window then told her shivering grandsonwe’ll call the new colt zero

 and before hell mouth dry plain and two mountains on the one mountain a running form and another in the turn of the hill in hard steel the road like a slow screw’s thread the angle almost imperceptible so that the circuit seemed hardly to rise and the running form naked blake shouting whirling his arms the swift limbs howling against the evil his eyes rolling whirling like flaming cartwheels and his head held backward to gaze on the evil as he ran from it to be hid by the steel mountain and when he showed again from the north side his eyes blazing toward hell mouth his neck forward and like him peire cardinal and in the west mountain il fiorentino seeing hell in his mirror and lo sordels looking on it in his shield and augustine gazing toward the invisible  and past them

acid to free myself of the hell ticks scales fallen louse eggs palux laerna the lake of bodies aqua morta of limbs fluid and mingled like fish heaped in a bin and here an arm upward clutching a

sunset and by their fountains the heroes sigismundo and malatesta novello and founders gazing at the mounts of their cities  the plain distance and in fountpools the nymphs of that water rising

the silk war         and they saw a procession coming down through a cut in the hills carrying something the six chaps in front carrying a long thing on their shoulders and they thought it was a funeral but the thing was wrapped up in scarlet and he put off in the cutter he was a middy in those days to see what the natives were doing and they got up to the six fellows in livery and they looked at it and i can still hear the old admiral “was it it was lord byron dead drunk with the face of an a  y  n               he pulled it out long like that the face of an a  y  n

like it  and wyndham lewis went to it with a heavy bit of artillery and the airmen came by with a mitrailleuse and cleaned out most of his company and a shell lit on his tin hut while he was out in the privy and he was all there was left of that outfit  windeler went to it and he was out in the ægæan and down in the hold of his ship pumping  gas into a sausage and the boatswain looked over the

 friends will you bear with me today for i have awakened from a dream in which a robin made with its shabby wings a kind of veil behind which it shimmied and stomped something from the south of spain its breast aflare looking me dead in the eye from the branch that grew into my window coochiecooing my chin the bird shuffling its little talons left then right while the leaves bristled against the plaster wall two of them drifting onto my blanket while the bird opened and closed its wings like a matador giving up on murder jutting its beak turning a circle and flashing again the ruddy bombast of its breast by which i knew upon waking it was telling me in no uncertain terms to bellow forth the tubas and sousaphones the whole rusty brass band of gratitude not quite dormant in my belly it said so in a human voice “bellow forth” and who among us could ignore such odd and precise counsel  hear ye hear ye i am here to holler that i have hauled tonsby which i don’t mean lots i mean tons of cowshit and stood ankle deep in swales of maggots swirling the spent beer grains the brewery man was good enough to dump off holding his nose for they smell very bad but make the compost writhe giddy and lick its lips twirling dung with my pitchfork again and again with hundreds and hundreds of other people we dreamt an orchard this way furrowing our brows and hauling our wheelbarrows and sweating through our shirts and two years later there was a party at which trees were sunk into the wellfed earth one of which a liberty apple after being watered in was tamped by a baby barefoot with a bow hanging in her hair biting her lip in her joyous work and friends this is the realest place i know it makes me squirm like a worm i am so grateful you could ride your bike there or roller skate or catch the bus there is a fence and a gate twisted by hand there is a fig tree taller than you in indiana it will make you gasp it might make you want to stay alive even thank you  and thank you for not taking my pal when the engine of his mind dragged him to swig fistfuls of xanax and a bottle or two of booze and thank you for taking my father a few years after his own father went down thank you mercy mercy thank you for not smoking meth with your mother oh thank you thank you for leaving and for coming back and thank you for what inside my friends’ love bursts like a throng of roadside goldenrod gleaming into the world likely hauling a shovel with her like one named aralee ought with hands big as a horse’s and who like one named aralee ought will laugh time to time til the juice runs from her nose oh thank you for the way a small thing’s wail makes the milk or what once was milk in us gather into horses hucklebuckling across a field  and thank you friends when last spring the hyacinth bells rang and the crocuses flaunted their upturned skirts and a quiet roved the beehive which when i entered were snugged two or three dead fistsized clutches of bees between the frames almost clinging to one another this one’s tiny head pushed into another’s tiny wing one’s forelegs resting on another’s face the translucent paper of their wings fluttering beneath my breath and when a few dropped to the frames beneath honey and after falling down to cry everything’s glacial shine  and thank you too and thanks for the corduroy couch i have put you on put your feet up here’s a light blanket a pillow dear one for i can feel this is going to be long i can’t stop my gratitude which includes dear reader you for staying here with me for moving your lips just so as i speak here is a cup of tea i have spooned honey into it  and thank you the tiny bee’s shadow perusing these words as i write them and the way my love talks quietly when in the hive so quietly in fact you cannot hear her but only notice barely her lips moving in conversation thank you what does not scare her in me but makes her reach my way thank you the love she is which hurts sometimes and the time she misremembered elephants in one of my poems which oh here they come garlanded with morning glory and wisteria blooms trombones all the way down to the river thank you the quiet in which the river bends around the elephant’s solemn trunk polishing stones floating on its gentle back the flock of geese flying overhead  and to the quick and gentle flocking of men to the old lady falling down on the corner of fairmount and 18th holding patiently with the softest parts of their hands her cane and purple hat gathering for her the contents of her purse and touching her shoulder and elbow thank you the cockeyed court on which in a halfcourt 3 vs 3 we oldheads made of some runnynosed kids a shambles and the 61yearold after flipping a reverse layup off a back door cut from my nolook pass to seal the game ripped off his shirt and threw punches at the gods and hollered at the kids to admire the pacemaker’s scar grinning across his chest thank you the glad accordion’s wheeze in the chest thank you the bagpipes  thank you to the woman barefoot in a gaudy dress for stopping her car in the middle of the road and the tractor trailer behind her and the van behind it whisking a turtle off the road thank you god of gaudy thank you paisley panties thank you the organ up my dress thank you the sheer dress you wore kneeling in my dream at the creek’s edge and the light swimming through it the koi kissing halos into the glassy air the room in my mind with the blinds drawn where we nearly injure each other crawling into the shawl of the other’s body thank you for saying it plain fuck each other dumb  and you again you for the true kindness it has been for you to remain awake with me like this nodding time to time and making that noise which i take to mean yes ori understand orplease go on but not too long orwhy are you spitting so much oreasy tiger hands to yourself i am excitable i am sorry i am grateful i just want us to be friends now forever take this bowl of blackberries from the garden the sun has made them warm i picked them just for you i promise i will try to stay on my side of the couch  and thank you the baggie of dreadlocks i found in a drawer while washing and folding the clothes of our murdered friend the photo in which his arm slung around the sign to “the trail of silences” thank you the way before he died he held his hands open to us for coming back in a waft of incense or in the shape of a boy in another city looking from between his mother’s legs or disappearing into the stacks after brushing by for moseying back in dreams where seeing us lost and scared he put his hand on our shoulders and pointed us to the temple across town  and thank you to the man all night long hosing a mist on his earlybloomed peach tree so that the hard frost not waste the crop the ice in his beard and the ghosts lifting from him when the warming sun told him sleep now thank you the ancestor who loved you before she knew you by smuggling seeds into her braid for the long journey who loved you before he knew you by putting a walnut tree in the ground who loved you before she knew you by not slaughtering the land thank you who did not bulldoze the ancient grove of dates and olives who sailed his keys into the ocean and walked softly home who did not fire who did not plunge the head into the toilet who said stop don’t do that who lifted some broken someone up who volunteered the way a plant birthed of the reseeding plant is called a volunteer like the plum tree that marched beside the raised bed in my garden like the arugula that marched itself between the blueberries nary a bayonet nary an army nary a nation which usage of the word volunteer familiar to gardeners the wide world made my pal shout “oh” and dance and plunge his knuckles into the lush soil before gobbling two strawberries and digging a song from his guitar made of wood from a tree someone planted thank you  thank you zinnia and gooseberry rudbeckia and pawpaw ashmead’s kernel cockscomb and scarlet runner feverfew and lemonbalm thank you knitbone and sweetgrass and sunchoke and false indigo whose petals stammered apart by bumblebees good lord please give me a minute and moonglow and catkin and crookneck and painted tongue and seedpod and johnny jumpup thank you what in us rackets glad what gladrackets us  and thank you too this knuckleheaded heart this pelican heart this gaptoothed heart flinging open its gaudy maw to the sky oh clumsy oh bumblefucked oh giddy oh dumbstruck oh rickshaw oh goat twisting its head at me from my peach tree’s highest branch balanced impossibly gobbling the last fruit its tongue working like an engine a lone sweet drop tumbling by some miracle into my mouth like the smell of someone i’ve loved heart like an elephant screaming at the bones of its dead heart like the lady on the bus dressed head to toe in gold the sun shivering her shiny boots singing erykah badu to herself leaning her head against the window  and thank you the way my father one time came back in a dream by plucking the two cables beneath my chin like a bass fiddle’s strings and played me until i woke singing no kidding singing smiling thank youthank you stumbling into the garden where the juneberry’s flowers had burst open like the bells of french horns the lily my mother and i planted oozed into the air the bazillion ants labored in their earthen workshops below the collard greens waved in the wind like the sails of ships and the wasps swam in the mint bloom’s viscous swill  and you again you for hanging tight dear friend i know i can be longwinded sometimes i want so badly to rub the sponge of gratitude over every last thing including you which yes awkward the suds in your ear and armpit the little sparkling gems slipping into your eye soon it will be over  which is precisely what the child in my dream said holding my hand pointing at the roiling sea and the sky hurtling our way like so many buffalo who said it’s much worse than we think and sooner to whom i said no duh child in my dreams what do you think this singing and shuddering is what this screaming and reaching and dancing and crying is other than loving what every second goes away goodbye i mean to say and thank you every day

 1   what’s the word she cries from her purchase on the iron finial of the front gate to my heart  the radio in the kitchen is stuck in the year i was born the capitals of the world are burning  and this sparrow with a woman’s face roars in the burdened air  air crowded with voices but no word mobbed with talking but no word teeming with speech but no word  this woman with the body of a bird is shrieking fierce buzzed volts in the swarming babble what’s the word  this evening is the year of my birth the country has just gained its independence social unrest grows rampant as the economy declines under a corrupt government of the army and the rich come years of mass poverty decades of starving children and raciallyfueled mayhem word is  armed squads raping women by the hundreds word is beheadings public lynchings and riots word is burning looting curfews and shoottokill orders and word is more deadly days lie ahead  today tomorrow and yesterday the forecast calls for more misery more poverty more starvation more families fleeing their homes more refugees streaming toward every border  more horror is to come that’s the word more scapegoating is to come that’s the word more violence is to come on the roads in the streets in the homes violence  in the churches in the temples where they preach who to love and who to hate how to get to heaven and who to leave behind how to don the fleece of the blameless and prosecute your neighbor  all against all is to come that’s the word  who hasn’t heard that she spits you call yourself a poet you tame high finisher of paltry blots  you publish doubt and call it knowledge you destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify your envy you murder benevolence and virtue with condescension you pretend to poetry and destroy imagination your words mystify mislead and misdirect you ape the word made flesh with words made words to multiply more words and words about your words and you ritualize these sterile pleasures miming joy delight and generation you celebrate cheap distractions your theories bloom in suicide of the mind starvation of the heart and mass maladies of the soul you mock and mimic sincerity you read and divine by irony you snare the little ones you pose stumbling blocks to the lame you dig pits for the blind you sell desolation your science is despair what’s the word  i can tell she’s up to no good this feathered interval monument to the nano this deciding gram my geronimo  she’s out to overturn an empire to usurp principalities and powers just by swooping into the right assembly perplexing a senate baffling a parliament or bewildering somebody’s crosshairs  not worth a farthing and without a cent she would own the realm her shrill cries measure trading dying for being  i tell her i sang in a church choir during one war north american tv made famous i fled a burning archipelago in the rain on my mother’s back in another war nobody televised  in the midst of wars worldwide many in countries whose names i can’t pronounce i tucked christ’s promise and adam’s disgrace together with my pajamas under my pillow each morning unable to distinguish which was god’s first thought and which god’s second  therefore i seek asylum in the final word an exile from the first word and a refugee of an illegible past  who hasn’t witnessed the laws of merging and parting blessing and killing she says who isn’t subject to the hand that giveth and the hand that taketh the change of the guard with and without blood and their own dismembered history  fed to the unvanquished flowers lift every clock’s face and see the counting angels reckoning the killing angels busy at their anvils say what’s the word or die  it’s obvious she’s accounted for what the wind will take what the moths must eat the ants carry away the caesars keep  she’s a breathing remnant restored to springtime’s living cloth  she’s a pair of scissors trimming lament to allow for all i don’t know  and i can tell by the markings on her coat and her black eyes she knows which dreams to parse which to heed and which to bury  and look at those prehistoric feet no doubt she’s realized the secret to surviving her own tribe’s slaughter and dispersal  pocket dictionary packed with signs in another language blazing shard of the original emanation precambrian spark deposit igneous jot of infinite magnitude fiery iota  something about her precise little beak convinces me she grasps degree and knows which i’ s to dot and which to leave large and alone  there are words i say and there is the word  every word is a fluctuating flame to a wick that dies  but the word the word is a ruling sum and drastic mean the standard that travels without moving  words move but the word is fixed the true blank  the word is the voice of the lamp and words are soot blackening the glass  the movements of words engender time and death but the word lives outside of time and death inside time death rules life is death’s kingdom we live at dying’s rate words are a sop for death but the word is the mother of thresholds regulating life and death  the word begets presences impossible to confirm given the blinding action of time and the sea and the earth’s turning repose  and who is that supposed to feed whose thirst would that quench  she screeches her voice materializing a greater body of innumerable birds arriving at dominion increasing to overwhelm every mile of my heart that bloody aerie branching and leafing her feathers become all eyes and mouths her voice coming now from everywhere booming  when the lover is ready the beloved will appear  say what’s the word or we both die   2   i’ll call her my battle angel this evangelion seraphic herald of the ninth echelon pleromatic aeon demanding a founding gnosis her voice electric tekhelet septuagint a twoleaved door opening onto porches chambers and courts her voice a solomonic column of barley sugar  she’s why i’m crazy she’s why i can’t sleep she’s why i never sleep she’s why i avoid people she’s why i drill the eight limbs with the mudstep why i walk the octagon of trigrams inscribed on wudang why i practice the spiral ox jaw and the tiger’s mouth she’s why i’m hard to live with and why i say  the bread that rises in a house that fails the word father of zero and one is our advocate  a shut eye we name beginning the word sleeps and all is darkness  an open eye we name the treasure the word wakes and voices are heard among the sounds of water  the word dreams and worlds appear and stars beyond and behind our eyes and the moon with its hair tied up and its hair let down  bound on every side and wide open in the center the word hosts our breath our span the space of our dreaming and our thinking our stillness and our moving and the emerging present is one of its bodies  the fulcrum the eye the heart enthroned the dove without person homing the word  is a hammer raining down its songs a river pouring out of the mouth of the anvil  twin and unlike the word is without peer black and white it is a wheeling pair of coincident opposites turning on a point existence and nonexistence hand in hand substance and void begetting life and death  the word is an open book and its first and last pages are missing  it is a brother and sister telling each other the missing parts of one another’s stories  it is the lover and the beloved constantly changing places in the fire  and it is the wind in the treetops outside our window a voice torn to pieces hear it  the wind without a house she says time without a gate she says a memory of the ocean torments the trees a homesickness she says  the wind is leafing through both of our histories looking for a happy ending  it is my hand moving over your body i say finding more and more to know  it is a circle of women reciting in the round the oldest stories of death disguised as a traveler or overlooked familiar friend we shunned for less faithful playmates  it is a house and from inside come the voices of children taking turns reading to one another it is their own story they read  but why do their voices seem uneasy does the moon giant at the window frighten them  does death run amok through all the pages of the story do the pages turn by themselves are there strangers in the house is the house burning  soldiers with guns are at our door again sister quick change into a penny i’ll fold you in a handkerchief put you in my pocket and jump inside a sack of rice one of the uncooked kernels  men with knives are looking in our windows again brother hurry turn yourself into one of our mother’s dolls sitting on the living room shelf i’ll be the dust settling on your eyelids  the ones wearing wings are in the yard  the ones adorned with lightning are in the house  the ones decorated with stars are dividing our futures among them  don’t answer when they call to us in the voice of nanny  don’t believe them when they promise sugar  don’t come out until evening or when you hear our mother weeping to herself  if only i could become the mirror in her purse i’d never come back until the end of time   3   the treetops buck and heave in the night wind like drunks at sea leaning too far over a rocking bulwark like a woman throwing her green and gold hair in time to a song only she can hear  and from inside that windswept bulk growing darker comes a frenzied uproar of what must be hundreds of hidden birds  all that noise of wind leaves and branches all that uttering from unseen throats and is there no word  all that shrieking iterating crying in the rustling leaves all that screaming shrilling running din of squeaky wheels radiant numbers of tongues beaks hubs wings spokes keening in centrifugal spinning and not one word not any nor part no bearing  one hunger a fanned fire roars in the voice of the sea  one light eats itself unconsumed  the wind is taking the night apart she says the wind is dismantling the leaves the branches the minutes our listening  and finding more and more moving pieces to index our hands our mouths our voices recurring stairs  of an imperfect past a rumored present figures multiplying inside a mirror  each alone in his dream of the world i say is host and guest a book and the one who reads it by the light of a vanished childhood  don’t say that she says we see by the light of who we are look at us you inside me inside you we’ve lived inside each other from the beginning and from before beginning before the world was ever found  before the world was found i say i dwelled inside you and you breathed all through me in my body and its happiness in my body and its loneliness  after i found the world i had to go looking for you ever since the world i only lose you and find you lose you and find you  the body of the beloved is the lover’s true homeland she says  i can hear you but i can’t hear me i say your voice a burning gown of song and time and me with my ghosts me with my mockingbird  don’t say that she says  what is my mind i wonder but the reflected light of your  voice o burning one o seeing voice o speaking eye that renders us  now legible now indecipherable now strangers traveling under assumed names  don’t say that she says look a single page of the wind copied by hand is the volume of despair the smallest living wing displaces and your voice will be your cup each day my wings shelter your dear momentary earth  my mind is several minds i say each abiding differently in your eyes in the smell of your hair in your voice moving over me in my voice moving over you  she says don’t look at your hands watch the shadows they make  i say moving over you my voice crosses out of forbidden chambers of the emperor of china through chronicles of exile and death in a foreign country to touch the ground i touch in me when i speak to you  she says a new mind makes the world new true words are a little blue and being human makes the saddest music in the world  she says postpone all morning bells the ore lies awake inside the rock a dream of origin waiting to be rescued  i say the glare of your nakedness confounds me a distraction from the darker incandescence of your being inside you is the safest place to be  the radio in the kitchen is stuck in the year i was born the capitals of the world are burning  and of all the things on my mind this evening words weigh the least death weighs the most and your voice’s body beneath my voice’s moving hand is a green agent of freedom and law best friend to my earth and my ache  of all the things keeping me from sleep words weigh too much yet not enough time weighs nothing at all but i can’t bear it and your body burdened by minutes and ancient rites is my favorite sad song  one wave that gives rise to three shoulder hip and knee your body is the lord’s pure geometry disguised as time your body is tears lilies and the mouth of the falls  and of all the things we’re dying from tonight being alive is the strangest surviving our histories is the saddest time leaves the smallest wounds and your body a mortal occasion of timeless law is all the word i know

 i will take your stony heart and give you one of flesh the wake     sewing shut those white lips and after    when leagues     and all behind to salt fell     the grateful spaniards prayed it became their habit     to turn eyes     sore away from surfeit     rashes and abrasions of spring leaf  stem  vine  blossom  aphid amp berry stridulant intricate and promiscuous     without the rose or borage or pomegranate embowered in flaunting silks on gauntlet cuffs     no none of that repose their soldierlove required to root  20000 had died in ravenna     he survived without mark to show what he knew how fear cramped each man solitary inside himself until the spark that leapt     stinging them on to violence     the grassfire battlefrenzy the grass that kneels to its burning then aftermath’s vegetable melee     limbs and bodies  but what is not threat in this contagion and panic of green     whores  wives  saints  sovereigns this beach     that thickleaved mustardy shrub     names he thinks     the names keep slipping  swift     intent     armored obdurate as beetles     no one man felt the wound of where like adam     too late he walked              the air     flexing     began to bruise green around them the fresh human injury of them     like flies trapped in a bottle     they didn’t know what to do and carried on doing it while bird     by bird invisible rescinded its song while the sun     a drop of vinegar in milk      curdled the sky quiet     sumptuous as pain eased by what hand abrupt as that held in the breath exhausted just before the witch confesses  like an executioner     who ropes hair over hand to bend and lengthen the neck for his ax the wind brutalized palm trees     spun men before it loosely as leaves in a stream he linked arms with another broken wing     splintering oar     chainless anchor dragging through darkness thick with sand and water and noise whistles  braying  drums  timbrels amp ululations pressed all night to the porch of the storm his ear mistook the self’s own alienated music     called it sorcery  that the fury never ended he would learn walking the eye of its silence  after the hurricane the stunned brilliance     like a spell or question he woke into     waking by himself     to himself and naked as a saint     to discover his ship with its ropes  tools  weapons  salves  spain was the anchored ship now hoisted on planks of sunlight     over the palmtrees sailing out of sight     the boat sick for such mirth made by root  sap  riverbank amp squirrel it would return to that green oak it once had been              in what hour of what night did he know his soul to turn a stranger to him pilgrim     he will venture forth across uncertain fields explorer     he will cry out  he may be nothing more than a hide rigid with gore amp soil to be scoured  pounded  abused by caustics and by iron and     in watered pigeonshit     kneaded until supple for the hand but whose     and must the hand continue to wear     or it will toughen again              daily he marched his men into corrugations of blue distances dissolving one to another    like promises of gold amp corn made by guides snatched from villages as the spanish found new ways to die     natives loomed     naked on the horizon they looked splendid amp violent as idols     their women amp children restored for ransoms of melons or fish  often some chief would repeat his good friend possessed more of each thing they desired     his noble gestures spread like balm     his speech intoxicating but so militant their hunger     his words came entire amp legible to their sense as the amber amp musk that steamed from these his fine furs              his dwindling force through swamps amp ambush labored     circuitous     stalled like mayflies in their brevity amp towarding and never fable  riches  youth  nor rest to take only the body with its anxious extremeties     eccentric     naked not natural     from which a vein of fascinated shame opened darkly     glittering     smoldering like seacoal     every eye interrogated each inquisitor humiliated by these echoes of himself     his body violating the silence              now alone and exposed     approaching he amassed his ocherous archive of blister and of bruise     the old fabulous atlas of faith in blood amp smoke redrawn  still even the most exacting map dreams omits amp lies brindled with sums amp suppositions  every step makes him more wilderness he goes interiorly to trade conches  seasnails amp screwbeans for reddyed deertail tassels and the arrowmakers’ sinew amp flint between ragged bands surrounded by enemies     enthralled by visions that command them to bury their sons alive girls whose marriages would multiply their foes become meat for their dogs where were the jades  turquoises  zinzibar where the sacred monsters  cannibals  or kings fielding legions of dogheaded warriors husbands groaned bucked by pain onto the dirt when wives gave birth amp both sexes wept strenuously after any absence     overjoyed to see each other again in no essential changed  had any man traveled farther than he              whether time is the ripening of fruit     the dying of fish amp the position of stars     or all the king’s clocks ringing his will upon the quarterhour hunger is the self’s severe eternal

entire skin burnt crisp flesh i know to be sweet her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file each pierced by black hooks through breast bill and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass i step to the counter recite and he without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue scribbles my order on a greasy receipt and chops it up quick  such a sorrowful chinese face nomad gobi northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw he could be my brother but finer and except for his left forearm which is engorged sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a twopound tool hes delicate narrow waisted his frame so slight a lover some rough other might break it down its smooth oily length in his lighthanded calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness he is a southerner from a riverprovince suited for scholarship his face poised above an open book he’d mumble his favorite passages he could be my grandfather come to america to get a western education in 1917 but too homesick to study he sits in the park all day reading poems and writing letters to his mother  he lops the head off chops the neck of the duck into six slits the body open groin to breast and drains the scalding juices then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver old blade that has worn into the surface of the round footthick chopblock a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel  the head flung from the body opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes and i see foetalcrouched inside the skull the homunculus gray brain grainy to eat did this animal after all at the moment its neck broke image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death is this how i too recoil from my day see how this shape hordes itself see how little it is see its grease on the blade is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed when names are called when crimes are tallied this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open is this how i presided over my century is this how i regarded the murders this is also how i prayed was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed this too was how i slept clutching my wife was it me in the other i loved when i loved another the butcher sees me eye this delicacy with a finger he picks it out of the skullcradle and offers it to me i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down i eat my man  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of upanddown inandout a lump of muscle chugchugging blood into the ear a lover’s heartshaped tongue flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time an engine crossing recrossing salt water hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor these are the faces i love the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways at various times thirteen gathered around the redwood happy talkative voracious at day’s end eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands  brothers and sisters by blood and design who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes we constitute a manymembered body of love in a world of shapes of my desires each one here is a shape of one of my desires and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts the face the body that jut jaw to gnash tendon that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites those long eyes closing on the seen those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang these teeth to bite my monosyllables these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul puffed or sunken according to the life dark or light according to the birth straight or humped whole manqué quasi each pleases verging on utter grotesquery all are beautiful by variety the soul too is a debasement of a text but thus it acquires salience although a human salience but inimitable and hence memorable god is the text the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic  a bright moment i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty downcurved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to including me the eater whole unto itself complete without me yet its shape complements the shape of my mind i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me and i feel urged to utterance urged to read the body of the world urged to say it in human terms my reading a kind of eating my eating a kind of reading my saying a diminishment my noise a loveinanswer what is it in me would devour the world to utter it what is it in me will not let the world be would eat not just this fish but the one who killed it the butcher who cleaned it i would eat the way he squats the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish clubs it takes it to the sink guts it drops it on the weighing pan i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water that liquid violence between the man’s hands i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse i would eat it all to utter it the deaths at the sinks those bodies prepared for eating i would eat and the standing deaths at the counters in the aisles the walking deaths in the streets the deathfarfromhome the death inastrangeland these chinatown deaths these american deaths i would devour this race to sing it this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world

 chile 1834  a month before his dinner with the visiting spanish lawyer he had “set out for the purpose of geologizing” and rode back over the ridge of the chilecauquen with a huge jute bag of living shells from the sandy flats at the coast and with another as full of dead barnacles scraped from the rock a few months forward from that dinner on the island of san pedro where the beagle was anchored awaiting himhe would be sneaking up on a fox “of a kind very rare” and donking it stoutly “on the head with my geological hammer” the fox he’ll write “is now in the zoological society” so what does he think when the spanish lawyer expresses a disbelief that the king of england would be so loco as to bother to ship to this sensible orderly country a man “to pick up beetles and lizards and to break stones” no the whiff of something “off ”like suspect meatattends eccentric stunts like these “i do not like it if one of us were to go and do such things in england do not you think the king of england would very shortly command us to leave his shores” renous another student of bugs and rocks from germany is also there at dinner and he mentions then that once in a house in san fernando he’d been discovered contemplating the transformation of caterpillars to butterflies he couldn’t deny it there they were the writhing green proof in an open box “the padres and the governor consulted and agreed it must be some heresy”and so renous was arrested darwin can only shake his head in a quiet bemusement as his guests converse those inchling creatures crawling over their choppedup foliage heads as blunt as thimbled thumbs   heretical how could anybody believe that the innocent jumble in the baskets and flasks of a naturalist is dangerous    and lillian coltonthe woman in owatonna minnesota who for forty years has avidly collected the seeds of that state and with them “poking them into place with toothpicks and gluing them down” has portraitured “american presidents movie stars country musicians rock and roll legends scientific and religious leaders including mother teresa” what suspiciousness might seize the spanish lawyer if he saw her on her rounds what edgy wariness would grip him if he chanced on nellie staves “at 87 perhaps the most famous adirondack trapper” out in the summer to harvest shellshaped fungus off the dead trees of those shaded spinous hills she’ll work for twenty hours straight on one with the point of an old school compass stippling it into the scene of a great alerteyed ram or a sunrise watching as the fungus’s own interior brown juices dye the image into permanence who would these represent for the spanish lawyer what forbidden othera girl in the corner walling her attention away from her sisters’ strident hiphop by reading a fanciful tale of witches a girl on a dancer pole at sturgis strobing her tits for the boys in a quick 121 semaphore of fucktheworkweek revelry surely not surely these are no threat to his world and yet for nothing more than positing a newly ordered sky map giordano bruno was led in chains from his cell in the roman prison of castel san’angelo there where he’d spent eight years as the inquisition hammered at his ideas and his calm resolve it was february 19th 1600 he was tied to an iron stake a wedge was stuffed in his mouth to prevent any final utterance of blasphemy and he was burned alive the leg skin bubbled off of his body like a christmas pig’s it turns out that a redone sky implies a redone godand a god is intolerant of this a god is jealous of any counter claim to the pedigree of his cosmos yes but    surely not this mushroom picker not this boy who simply speaks to invisible friends as he wanders around the alleys oh but that would depend on the given spanish lawyer of that

wanting only to declare their love in a marriage vow “like anyone” as edie says not that my schoolboy humor would find favor in their reading life    although we get along some shared affinity enables the church of the gay girls and the orthodox congregation of guy to coexist with an amiability still i’ve witnessed other people pass them by with the slitted ophidian stare of xenophobia suzette and edie are they the new apostasy are they our own anne hutchinson in 1638 she was found guilty after a twoday trial of heresyof being “a woman not fitt for our society” with will she had embraced doctrinal misinterpretations “some of them blasphemus others erroneus and all unsafe and of the devill of hell” and she was excommunicated from massachusetts bay colony “evermore” her actual crimea claim “the holy spirit illumines the heart of every true believer” without the need of a minister intervening for this she was harried into the wilds it was called a “hivingout”and set at the mercy of wolf and of winter “and it were death to return” her other actual crimethat after a pregnancy she had been delivered “of thirtie monstrus births or therabowts at once some of them bigger some lessr some of one shape some of an other few of any perfect shape none at all of them of human shape”which perhaps is what you’d expect from a woman of “nimble witt and active spirit and verie voluble tonggue” at the republican convention it was indeed the voluble tongue that edie always flapped so saucily and too i’d guess her rainbowhue we’re already bedded    why not wedded tshirt that on her side led inevitably to the violence a surly officer suggested that she move she pointed out how she was already in the cagedoff square allowed for freespeech protest and had no intention of leaving there were “gestures they exchanged”   and then a stun gun’s 50000 volts were suddenly alive inside her just enough to crumple her into helplessness so that when the panic began she was trampled by friends and police alike a lung was crushed and when i visited three weeks later her skin was still a nightmare turkish rug of bruise for a moment i saw in the air around her the first disabling gust of snow in the woods at the border of massachusetts bay in 1638 to be fair i should add that the confrontational officer doing crowd control went home with his head little more than a pocket of blood and neural damage do not i warn you ever lightly cross a wiccan bowler    terms i haven’t yet used from my pile of notes separatist sedition dogma finally though when those clouds of abstraction open up it’s always one specific ordinary rainy day in chicago in 1961 i’m thirteen squeakyvoiced and with an adam’s apple popping from my thin throat like a doorknobwhile my father is large he fought the neighbor’s crazy german shepherd to a standstill once and behind him are generations of him solemn and knowing we’re standing there in front of the house in a dim autumnal downpour and it wouldn’t look to anyone else like an even match my scrawny shouts his thousands of years of righteousness and yet in emotional terms i have the upper hand i won’t believe in his god i won’t believe in any god in any synagogue in any mumbo jumbo or rabbinical teetotum and i’m screaming this and screaming this and screaming this until i see the rain become his face and for the only time except his mother’s funeral on a similar day of wet and chill in a shivering mix my father cries in front of me and god if he’s there must write my name down on a list that he’ll turn over to his deputies on earth his spanish lawyers there are many terms for this but only one rain now it’s falling grayish twill on a hill along the coast of the chonos archipelago islands 1835 a mound of seals in the distance “huddled together asleep they appeared to be of a loving disposition but even pigs would be ashamed of their dirt” which is picked at by the turkeybuzzards terns gulls blacknecked swans a deposit of sandstone “four great snowy cones” of the local volcanoes he couldn’t be happier he has computed the number of eggs in a tenthofaninch of a seaslug’s potent slime he has suggested how “a great volume

in halves” and jumped back down    around the tower 1000 greeks 1000 ilians amid their swirl his green hair dressed in braids each braid tipped with a little silver bell note nyro of simithe handsomest of all the greeks save a the trouble was he had no fight he dashed from fight to fight struck a quick blow then dashed straight out again save that this time he caught as prince aenéas caught his breath that prince’s eye who blocked his dash and as lord panda waved and walked away took his head off his spine with a backhand slice beautiful stuff    straight from the blade    still as it was a special head mowgag aenéas’ minder bright as a box of rocks but musical spiked it then hoisted it and twizzling the pole beneath the blue the miles of empty air marched to the chingaling of its tinklers a knees high majorette towards the greeks the tower    a roar of wind across the battlefield  a pause  and then  scattering light the plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped the queen of heaven shrills “typhoid for troy” and through poor nyro’s wobbling mouth athena yells  “slew of assiduous mediocrities meek greeks”    it is enough  centreplain wide lit everywhere by rays of glorious light they rushed their standards into ilium diomed for once swept forward converting shame to exaltation with his cry  “neverto helen’s gold without her self neverto helen’s self without her gold”  mowgag well slain hewn through his teeth his jaw slashed off and nyro’s head beside him in the grass  when nyro’s mother heard of this she shaved her head she tore her frock she went outside ripping her fingernails through her cheeks then down her neck her chest her breasts and bleeding to her waist ran round the shops sobbing “god kill troy console me with its death revenge is all i have my boy was kind he had his life to live i will not have the chance to dance in hector’s blood but let me hear some have before i die”  “i saw her running round i took the photograph it summed the situation up he was her son they put it out in colour right my picture went around the world”    down the shaft of the shot in his shortstaved bow lord panda has been followspotting diomed  between “her self ”  “her gold” he shoots it hits and as its barbs protrude through dio’s back aenéas hears lord panda shout “he bleeds the totem greek rightshoulderfront how wise of artemis to make panda her matador her numero uno moi”  diomed hit the heart went out of those who followed him and they fell back    shields all round  diomed on his knees  lifting his hands  “sister and wife of god”  as sethynos breaks off the arrowhead  “eliminate my pain”  settles his knee beneath his hero’s shoulderblades  “let me kill that oaf who claims my death”  bridges his nape with one hand  “before it comes with honour to my name”  then with his other hand in one long strong slow pull drew the shank back and out    she heard his prayer  before their breathless eyes his blood ran back into the pout the shank had left and to complete her miracle lord diomed rose up between them stood in the air then hovered down onto his toes brimming with homicidal joy imparting it to greece  then troy was driven back trampling the halfstripped stillmasked carcasses hatching the centre of the plain    aenéas  panda   “get him”  “get him i got himhe is dead but there he is”  and diomed has spotted them  “calm down” aenéas said “perhaps he is possessed”  “what god would visit him”  “so pray to yoursand try another shot”  “huntress” lord panda prays brightankled   god of nets and lines of tangled mountains ilex groves and dark cascades   ”  but artemis was bored with him and let him rise still praying hard into the downflight of the javelin diomed aired at prince aenéas  sunlit it went through panda’s lips out through his neck and then through biblock’s neck and so they fell the lord face up the friend face down gripping the bloodsmeared barb between his teeth between the sea and snow  aenéas covers them  eyeing his plate technology you can enjoy diomed found and threw a stone as heavy as a cabbage made of lead that hit and split aenéas’ hip who went down on one knee and put his shield hand on the grass and with his other hand covered his eyes dido might have become a grandmother and rome not had its day except as diomed came on to lop his top aenéas’ mama aphrodité dressed in grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold and snakeskin flipflops stepped between him and the greek a glow came from her throat and from her hair a fragrance that betokened the divine stooping she kissed him better as queen hera whispered “greek cut that bitch” and diomed you did nicking love’s wrist    studying the ichor as it seeped across her pulse into her palm our lady of the thong lifted her other hand removed a baby cobra from her hair and dropped it diomed onto your neck and saw its bite release its bane into your blood then nobody could say who diomed fought for or for what he fought  rapt through the mass now shouting at the sky now stomping on the plain he killed and killed and killed greek trojan greek lordless shamefame both gone and gone loyalty nurtured in the face of death the duty of revenge the right to kill to jeer to strip to gloat to be the first to rally but the last to run all gone and gone our lady aphrodité giggling  while everywhere  driving your fellow greeks back down the long incline that leads to the scamánder’s ford surely as when lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams a bitter wind detonates line by line of waves against the shore  no mind even as teucer backed away he kept his eyes on you “you feel the stress you feel the fear behold your enemy the prince god loves” see   teucer’s bow hear teucer’s “this time lucky” his but this time it was not our father god who saved your life my prince as agamemnon cried “the ships are safe stand at the riverside’s far bank” teléspiax heard the rustle of lord teucer’s shot and stood between yourself and it  his head was opened egglike at the back mucked with thick blood blood trickling from his mouth his last words were “prince your trumpeter has lost his breath”  “our worst fear was his face would fade” teléspiax’s father said “but it did not we will remember it until we die”  “give his instrument to hogem” hector said and went lutie on reinsbetween the sea and snow throwing his chariots wide scamánderwards as easily as others might a cloak    diomed among this traffic on his own among his dead their pools of blood their cutoff bodyparts their cutoff heads ashamed as his head cleared to see odysseus idomeneo the ajaxbig and small whipping away downslope shouting towards odysseus “where are you going with your back to the battle” who shouted back although he did not turn “look left” and there was lutie driving hector onto him  sure they would trample him for sure queen hera’s human diomed would stand and die except “arms up young king” nestor full tilt reins round his tummy leaning out “and jump   ” wrists locked “   you young are just   ” swinging him up onto the plate “   too much”  “with your permission da” nod drew then threw the chariot’s javelin as lutie spun his wheels and hector threw those skewers trading brilliance as they passed and missedboth vehicles slitherstraightening regaining speed close close then driven apart by empty cars careering off the incline or stationary cars their horses cropping grass  “daddy go slow hector will say i   ran” “but not the widows you have made”  and slow and low cruising the blue above this mix heaven’s queen and ringsighteyed athena trumpeting down huge worms of sound as hector’s car rereached king nestor’s   and “what kept you prince” diomed offered as they came abreast “you went for a refreshing towel” and threw his axe that toppled through the air and oh hector my hector as you thought “if heaven helps me heaven shows it loves the best” parted your lutie’s mesh and smashed into his heart  what did you say as god called you to death dear lutie  “king prince i leave you   driverless”  and put the reins into his hands and fled into oblivion  as hector with his other hand held what his lutie was upright face forwards in between the chariot’s basket and himself shouting as he drove after them  “loathsome greek your loathsome hair your loathsome blood your loathsome breath your loathsome heart jump in your loathsome ships i will come after you come over the aegean after you and find you though you hide inside your loathsome father’s grave and with my bare hands twist your loathsome head off your loathsome neck”  there was a greek called themion mad about armour if not armour cars of course he went to troy and troy saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove companionably his horses galloped up on starlight’s side and muddled starlight down and bertie down and brought the prince still holding lutie down as all the world hurried as if by windheads on towards   scamánder’s ford   hether you reach it from the palisade or through the trees that dot the incline’s last stretch you hear scamánder’s voice before you see what one may talk across on quiet days its rippling sunspangled breadth streaming across the bars of pebbly sand that form its ford though on the fleet’s side deeper darkly bright  and here tiptoeing from this bar to that settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair her towel retained by nothing save herself the god of tops and thongs our lady aphrodité came her eyes brimfull with tears    scamánder is astonished by his luck  “beauty of beauties why are you weeping” “i have been hurt scamánder” “no   ” “humiliated” “no   ” “me a god just like yourself touched     ” “touched” “by a man” “a man” “a greek” “death to all greeks” “he cut me” “sacrilege    but where” “i need your healing touch” “how can i help you if you do not show me where” “moisten its lips and my wound will be healed” “you must say where” “well   ” the towel has slipped an inch “i am afraid you will be disappointed” “never” “are you sure” “yes” “you will not criticize me” “no” her wrist upturned outturned her opened palm fanning the fingers of her other hand stroking his spangles with her fingertips “goddess i love you i have always loved you say that you love me even a little i beg you god grant it” “i need your help scamánder” “take pity on me come into me” “you have your nymphs” “bores bores” “i might be nibbled by an eel” “death to all eels” the towel is down “step into me    i love your toes    please let me kiss your toes    your little dinkuminkum toes   ” “no one has kissed them so nicely scamánder” “and now your knees   ” “you tickle me   ” “and now your thighs” “oh oh go on   ” “and now your bum your holy bum your sacred bum the bum of paradise” “oh my scamánder i must have your help   ” “anything” the towel goes curling off and as she floated on his stream our lady aphrodité said “at any moment now the greeks will reach your troyside bank   ”  recall those sequences when horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a   stream somewhere in kansas or missouri say sosave they were   thousandsgreece into scamánder’s ford    coming downstream a smallish wave  that passes  but  scamánder’s flow does not relapse  indeed  almost without a sound its murmuring radiance rose into a dark torrential surge clouded with boulders crammed with trees as clamorous as if it were a sea that lifted greece then pulled greece down cars gone masks gone gone under reappearing gone  “onto your knees praise hector for this flood the prince god loves” prince hector claims as he comes through the trees  they do then up and run run thousands of them to hold those greeks who got back out under until their bubbles stopped while those swept off turned somersaults amid scamánder’s undertow    the flat  1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade  the king  “the lord has not abandoned us to cross will be as bad for them”    but it was not to be as bad for them  indeed as hector drove towards scamánder’s brink and astheir banners rising one by one one after one and then another one he and all ilium began to enter it the river reassumed its softlyspoken smooth sunspangled way  and agamemnon cried  “god what are you for what use are you to me”  as hector cries  “two miracles your prince is close to god”  and hera to athena  “fog”  and fog came down  and most of greece got out    troy holding hands midstream an army peering through its masks    miss tops and thongs to god  “your hera has   ”  and with a wish he turned the fog to light  and with a word he called them back to heaven    sky snow the 1000 yards the palisade  hector “i am your prince my name means hewhoholds troy and the plain and now the ships for troy” his battle cry rising into a common cry that cry into a clamour and that clamour to bayings of hatred  800 yards  the child “we are the greeks we fight to win if one is lost close his eyes step over him and kill his enemy”  800 yards  the greeks are tiring nestor is on his knees  “god of all gods most holy and most high if greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you protect our ships”    heaven soft music summertime queen hera and athena yes     some lesser gods observing their approach approach salaam and then lead them now both in black wraparound tops to god  “darling daddy here we are” “and” hera “here we stay until you stop that worthless hector killing greeks” up steps love hera “why is she wearing a tent” love “father see this” her wrist “human strikes god communism the end of everything”  “darlings” he said “you know that being a god means being blamed do thisno good do thatthe same the answer is avoid humanity rememberi am god i see the bigger picture”  “and i am hera heaven’s queen greece worships me”  “stuff greece” love said “your blubberbummed wife with her gobstopper nipples hates troy because troy’s paris put her last when we stripped off for him as for the ithacan boatboy’s undercurved preceptatrix she hates troy because my statue stands on its acropolis”  hera “the cities’ whores were taxed to pay for it” love dropping onto her knees before himself “please    stop them harming troy the greatest city in the world”  while hera and athena sang  “cleavage cleavage queen of the foaming hole mammoth or man or midge she sucks from pole to pole”  and god has had enough of it  lifting his scales he said  “hector will have his day of victory” then crashed them to the ground    700 yards  the palisade  its gate  late sunlight on gilt beaks  “there’s no escape from troy” “or from the plain at troy”  begging for ransom trojan hoti his arms around king menelaos’ knees  king agamemnon “off”  then he punched hoti in the face then punched him in the face again and then again and when he fell king agamemnon kicked him in the groin kicking him in the groin with so much force it took a step to follow up each kick then pulled him up then dragged him

prince “i get past   everything i see their war is lost”  it was  aenéas ábassee sarpédon gray calling to one another down the line then with a mighty wall of sound as if a slope of stones rolled down into a lake of broken glass we ran at them    and now the light of evening has begun to shawl across the plain blue gray gold gray blue gold translucent nothingnesses readying our space within the deep unchanging sea of space for hesper’s entrance and the silver wrap  covered with blood mostly their own loyal to death reckoning to die odysseus ajax diomed idomeneo nestor menelaos and the king  “do not die because others have died” “do not show them the palms of your hands”  “achil” “achil” “if he won’t help us heaven help us”  “stand still and fight” “feel shame in one another’s eyes” “i curse you god you are a liar god troy will be yours by darkimmortal lies” “home” “home” “there’s no such place” “you can’t launch burning ships” “more men survive if no one runs”  but that is what

prince the victory is mine”  chylábborak  “do not take cowardice for granted”  scarce had he said it when his son kykéon standing next to him took ajax’ final spear cast in his chest  “i shall not wear your armour sir” he said and died  “my son is dead”  the prince  “hector is loved by god”  and greece a wall of walking swords but walking backwards leaving the plain in silence and in tears    idomeneo running back out at those trojans who came too close   “you know my name come look for me and boy the day you do will be the day you die”    hector to troy “soldiers unmatched my force unconquerable my will after ten years of days in one long day to be remembered for as many days as there are days to come this is my day your hector’s day troy given back to troy my day of victory” and when the cheering died “some say destroy greece now but i say no out of your cars eat by your fires two hundred fires around each fire five hundred men “the sound of grindstones turning through the night the firelight that stands between our blades so let king agamemnon’s own hold hands and look into each other’s frightened eyes “true god great master of the widespread sky if only you would turn me into a god as you through me tomorrow by their ships will see greece die”    silence    a ring of lights  within  immaculate  in boatcloaks lined with red  king agamemnon’s lords  the

called god raised god recognized you are a piece of shit” diomed said  silence again  “let us praise god” lord ajax said “that hector stopped before he reached the ships”  silence again  then  nestor

ajax and of nestor as they walk along the shore towards achilles’ gate    “my lords”  “your lord”  “this way”    they find him with guitar singing of gilgamesh  “take my hands here they are”  you

our yard some decent local girl my father’s worth is all the wealth we will require you greeks will not take troy you have disintegrated as a fighting force troy is your cemetery blame your king the

 iiiv  i am writing this poem about the 1965 massacre of indonesians by indonesians  which in an article ten years later i could not publish except in nottingham england with  a friend malcolm caldwell who has since himself been murdered no one will say by whom but i will guess  seeing as this is precisely poetry the cias and now pekings cambodian  assassins the khmer serai in that article i estimated a halfmillion or more  killed in this period it took noam in a book suppressed by its first publisher  to quote admiral sudomo of the indonesian junta more than 500000  and now amnesty international many more than one million so much for my balanced prose  but none of us experienced that pervasive smell of death those impassable rivers  clogged with corpses robert lowell is that why even you a pacifist  had so little to say about it or you gentle reader let us examine carefully  the good reasons you and i dont enjoy reading this  like the time in the steep engadine we saw the

in uncomfrtable  luxury as delegates to the international student service bilderberg meetings  supplying prince bernhard with an almost unrivalled network not just for the european movement  financed with german counterpart funds but also for the recruitment of old intelligence contacts  as conduits for lockheed payoffs through the temperate zone research foundation  for antelope cobbler the

about puputan and tjalonarang have the right to recall  the fact of the massacre through the medium of the cockfight the theatricality of trance  but why did you write several hundred thousand people were massacred  largely villagers by other villagers though there were some army executions as well  when even shaplen admits the murders in bali did not start until early december  that is until after colonel edhies commandos with unitnames like dracula  had finished in east java the army began it then handed the job over to the balinese  that is to the special teams set up under nasutions

talk about his life as a policeman how much easier it had been  after stalin had died in those days no one wanted to talk to us  even our own children sometimes mistrusting us despite what they learned at school  we talked for two hours and i think of him often as i read in the papers  of solidarnosc suppressed how those must be privileged moments  one can so transcend history how today he would not dare to have such a conversation  nor i have the heart and yet those two hours in that illfurnished precinct  seem somehow more true than the street battles since my own life is easier  no

 sent in after new ground was taken my father ducked from ditch to shellhole unwinding the telephone cable behind him a pfc cast as mercury connecting the gods with the lesser gods  funny to think of him trailing the complex filament of speech that man neither shy nor sullen who answered only “yes” “no” “maybe” and never volunteered a private thought  standing off with his hands in his pockets or cupping a cigarette he seemed to be waiting with the great rural patience of fields for whatever might rise pure and nameless or fall from the sky beyond explanation  if anyone asked what he was thinking he said “nothing” and when he died he rushed out leaving everything unsaid uncoiling a dark line into darkness down which a familiar silence roars

 krystle krystle cole youre all i thought about sometimes i watched you while our daughter slept your sissy spacek ways your laconic demeanor in relaying either ecstasy or trauma amp the unembittered empathy your voice conveyed on youtube which is our loving cup the solution of butter amp dmt you took anally that really made you freak the fuck out amp your friends just stood there watching you as you hurtled alone through mirrored tunnels its that frictionless feeling the smooth amp vacant course that lacks abruption one wave the clinical mania un differentiated whiteness contains when cylindrical cloud hard amp plastic comes to represent the mind to the mind amp thus describe a model of terrible momentum with unity of purpose toward nothing so much as cold radiant nature stripped of eros of becoming just the mainframe amp its withering severity without any predicate of others save perhaps their gazes no walls no nothing completely white light amp your name when your consciousness was splitting time was stopping you were going always into that i was going always to the mall in those months the young centurys rainiest april amp may to walk the baby amp to understand my art i didnt understand i would move the stroller through the halogen over grooved tile amp across those smooth marble expanses meant to simulate floating amp gliding before that pure frictionless feeling was entire sometimes wed go inside the stores sears was still enormous amp because of its design implied a bound series of discrete related worlds linked by passages threatened amp precarious to me the connections felt besieged or like a mask for separation they felt like connection between us in life but i didnt take my allegory further krystle cole into your lysergic delirium later redeemed by a beautiful discipline of spirit amp cosmography developed for praxis i liked your video on candy flipping hard amp developing esp with friends it suggested oneness was a leavened mix of random indiscretion bruising wariness amp bliss obtained by synchronizing chemical encounter krystle theres a made up drug i wonder if youd do it bradley cooper in limitless takes this little pill which in its candy dot translucence looks a lot like a tear plucked from the cheek in man rays larmes with it he can utilize all of his brain amp so he unriddles the patterning hidden in the ceaseless flow of capital structuring its chaos in excess of any mortal with a terrible momentum amp unity of purpose toward nothing so much as pure profit amp complete subordination of the world at the mall certain spots sold old stuff sports memorabilia amp video games vintage organs amp deluxe baby grands in one store there were highly priced comics with toys amp ephemera related to the stories they had action figures based on some series i guess called the crisis ofinfinite earths i wrote the phrase down in my notebook amp realized only later that id made a rather telling trans position putting the word world where earth was amp thinking the crisis of infinite worlds i guess because anyone will occasion the world as a world its commonality precarious but real amp the person beside them does the same the person far in every way from them will as well where the wound of even being in material conditions where consciousness is made these confrontations amp arrangements each taking their referent then as earth or taking something else entirely as worldthe word is profligate amp dense amp transparent amp cheap amp impossibly one the clearest pill in our minds it floods with light amp we see through that lifes benevolent corruption in a radiance we cant make any sense of krystle have you ever just standing around noticed someone smoking in an older silver volvo amp watched the comeback feelings of a tupac easter sunday steep in their ambivalent features until they are more radiant than cinematic virgins having lost it in the wake of saint maria goretti whose patronage is lost to the brutalized sweetness of her charges when depicted in the mind amp reconstructed as a lowres simulation by scientists the weekend wall streets occupied amp particles are found to go faster than light then weirdly feel like this is paradise not for people but paradise regardless that same may i had gone to detroit i saw the most wonderful graffiti more a prayer written on a wall in magic marker it read two things 1 that we would grow closer amp closer as time progresses 2 that our ships would not crash magic marker on a surface doesnt have much depth of skin you move it smoothly on the wall amp it stays smooth barely records the softest friction of two separate textures meeting the wetness of its onyx dries quick or even quicker if you blow on it with circled lips like clouds in old maps that blew ships across a flat earth to an edge i dont exactly not idealize that somewhere theres a precipice in this world amp tracing my finger along those ardent lines id found the fault of it a little in its boldness far too faint amp not enough

 we thought it would come we thought the germans would come were almost certain they would i was thirtytwo the youngest assistant curator in the country i had some good ideas in those days  well what we did was this we had boxes precisely built to every size of canvas we put the boxes in the basement and waited  when word came that the germans were coming in we got each painting put in the proper box and out of leningrad in less than a week they were stored somewhere in southern russia  but what we did you see besides the boxes waiting in the basement which was fine a grand idea you’ll agree and it saved the art but what we did was leave the frames hanging so after the war it would be a simple thing to put the paintings back where they belonged  nothing will seem surprised or sad again compared to those imperious vacant frames  well the staff stayed on to clean the rubble after the daily bombardments we didn’t dream you know it lasted nine hundred days much of the roof was lost and snow would lie sometimes a foot deep on this very floor but the walls stood firm and hardly a frame fell  here is the story now that i want to tell you early one day a dark december morning we came on three young soldiers waiting outside pacing and swinging their arms against the cold they told us this in three homes far from here all dreamed of one day coming to leningrad to see the hermitage as they supposed every soviet citizen dreamed of doing now they had been sent to defend the city a turn of fortune the three could hardly believe  i had to tell them there was nothing to see but hundreds and hundreds of frames where the paintings had hung  “please sir” one of them said “let us see them”  and so we did it didn’t seem any stranger than all of us being here in the first place inside such a building strolling in snow  we led them around most of the major rooms what they could take the time for wall by wall now and then we stopped and tried to tell them part of what they would see if they saw the paintings i told them how those colors would come together described a brushstroke here a dollop there mentioned a model and why she seemed to pout and why this painter got the roses wrong  the next day a dozen waited for us then thirty or more gathered in twos and threes each of us took a group in a different direction castagno caravaggio brueghel cézanne matisse orozco manet da vinci goya vermeer picasso uccello your whistler wood and gropper we pointed to more details about the paintings i venture to say than if we had had them there some unexpected use of line or light balance or movement facing the cluster of faces the same way we’d done it every morning before the war but then we didn’t pay so much attention to what we talked about people could see for themselves as a matter of fact we’d sometimes said our lines as if they were learned out of a book with hardly a look at the paintings  but now the guide and the listeners paid attention to everythingthe simple differences between the first and postimpressionists romantic and heroic shade and shadow  maybe this was a way to forget the war a little while maybe more than that whatever it was the people continued to come it came to be called the unseen collection  here here is the story i want to tell you  slowly blind people began to come a few at first then more of them every morning some led and some alone some swaying a little they leaned and listened hard they screwed their faces they seemed to shift their eyes those that had them to see better what was being said and a cock of the head my god they paid attention  after the siege was lifted and the germans left and the roof was fixed and the paintings were in their places the blind never came again not like before this seems strange but what i think it was they couldn’t see the paintings anymore they could still have listened but the lectures became a little matteroffact what can i say confluences come when they will and they go away

 before the break of day the minister was awakened by the sound of hatchets breaking open the door and windows he ran towards the door about twenty indians with painted faces were coming into the house howling  three indians took hold of him and bound him as he stood in his nightshirt and began to rifle the house going into every room as he lay bound and helpless he thought of his wife and children his wife had given birth only a few weeks before and he remembered the passage in isaiah “i shall go to the gates of the grave deprived of the rest of my years  ”  the indians had taken two of his children to the door and killed them as well as the negro woman who helped take care of them keeping him bound with the cord about one arm they let him put on his clothes with the other and let his wife dress herself too as well as their children left alive  when the sun was an hour high all were led out of the house for the journey of three hundred miles to quebec snow up to their knees many of the houses were now on fire and as they left the town he saw his house and barn burning  at first the minister was not allowed to speak to any of his fellow captives as they marched but on the second day he had another indian to watch him and was allowed to speak with his wife when he overtook her and could walk with her and help her along she told him that she was losing her strength and they must expect to part and she hoped that god would keep him alive and their children still among the living but not a word of complaint saying that it was the will of god  when they came to a small river the captives had to wade it the water kneedeep and the current swift after that they had to climb a hill almost a mountain and the minister’s strength was almost gone when he came to the top but he was not allowed to sit down and even unburdened of his pack  he begged the indian in charge of him to let him go down and help his wife but the man would not let him and he asked each of the captives as they passed about her and heard at last that in going through the river she fell and plunged headfirst into the water and after that at the foot of the hill the indian who held her captive killed her with one stroke of his hatchet and left the body as meat for the fowls and beasts

 i love sweets heaven would be dying on a bed of vanilla ice cream   but my true self is thin all profile  and effortless gestures the sort of blond elegant girl whose body is the image of her soul  my doctors tell me i must give up this ideal but i will not  cannot  only to my husband i’m not simply a “case”  but he is a fool he married meat and thought it was a wife                            why am i a girl  i ask my doctors and they tell me they don’t know that it is just “given”  but it has such implications and sometimes i even feel like a girl                            now at the beginning of ellen’s thirtysecond year her physical condition has deteriorated still further her use of laxatives increases beyond measure every evening she takes sixty to seventy tablets of a laxative with the result that she suffers tortured vomiting at night and violent diarrhea by day often accompanied by a weakness of the heart she has thinned down to a skeleton and weighs only 92 pounds                            about five years ago i was in a restaurant eating alone with a book i was not married and often did that   i’d turn down dinner invitations so i could eat alone  i’d allow myself two pieces of bread with butter at the beginning and three scoops of vanilla ice cream at the end  sitting there alone with a book both in the book and out of it waited on idly watching people  when an attractive young man and woman both elegantly dressed sat next to me she was beautiful  with sharp clear features a good bone structure if she took her makeup off in front of you rubbing cold cream again and again across her skin she still would be beautiful more beautiful  and he i couldn’t remember when i had seen a man so attractive i didn’t know why he was almost  a male version of her  i had the sudden mad notion that i wanted to be his lover   were they married were they lovers  they didn’t wear wedding rings  their behavior was circumspect they discussed politics they didn’t touch   how could i discover  then when the first course arrived i noticed the way  each held his fork out for the other  to taste what he had ordered   they did this again and again with pleased looks indulgent smiles for each course more than once for each dish much too much for just friends   their behavior somehow sickened me  the way each gladly put the food the other had offered into his mouth  i knew what they were i knew they slept together  an immense depression came over me   i knew i could never with such ease allow another to put food into my mouth  happily myself put food into another’s mouth  i knew that to become a wife i would have to give up my ideal                            even as a child i saw that the “natural” process of aging  is for one’s middle to thicken one’s skin to blotch  as happened to my mother and her mother i loathed “nature”  at twelve pancakes became the most terrible thought there is   i shall defeat“nature”  in the hospital when they weigh me i wear weights secretly sewn into my belt                            january 16 the patient is allowed to eat in her room but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal this she demonstrated with utmost realism her physical examination showed nothing striking salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides january 21 has been reading faust again in her diary writes that art is the “mutual permeation” of the “world of the body” and the “world of the spirit” says that her own poems are “hospital poems  weakwithout skill or perseverance only managing to beat their wings softly” february 8 agitation quickly subsided again has attached herself to an elegant very thin female patient homoerotic component strikingly evident february 15 vexation and torment says that her mind forces her always to think of eating feels herself degraded by this has entirely for the first time in years stopped writing poetry                            callas is my favorite singer but i’ve only seen her once  i’ve never forgotten that night   it was in tosca she had long before lost weight her voice had been for years deteriorating half itself   when her career began of course she was fat  enormous in the early photographs sometimes i almost don’t recognize her   the voice too then was enormous healthy robust subtle but capable of crude effects even vulgar almost out of high spirits too much health   but soon she felt that she must lose weight that all she was trying to express  was obliterated by her body buried in flesh abruptly within four months she lost at least sixty pounds   the gossip in milan was that callas had swallowed a tapeworm  but of course she hadn’t  the tapeworm was her soul  how her soul uncompromising insatiable must have loved eating the flesh from her bones  revealing this extraordinarily mercurial fragile masterly creature   but irresistibly nothing stopped there the huge voice  also began to change at first it simply diminished in volume in size then the top notes became shrill unreliableat last usually not there at all   no one knows why perhaps her mind ravenous still insatiable sensed  that to struggle with the shreds of a voice  must make her artistry subtler more refined more capable of expressing humiliation rage betrayal   perhaps the opposite perhaps her spirit loathed the unending struggle  to embody itself to manifest itself on a stage whose  mechanics and suffocating customs seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit   i know that in tosca in the second act when humiliated hounded by scarpia she sang vissi d’arte “i lived for art”  and in torment bewilderment at the end she asks with a voice reaching harrowingly for the notes  “art has repaid me like this”  i felt i was watching autobiography an art skill virtuosity  miles distant from the usual soprano’s athleticism the usual musician’s dream of virtuosity without content  i wonder what she feels now listening to her recordings  for they have already within a few years begun to date   whatever they express they express through the style of a decade and a half a style she helped create   she must know that now she probably would not do a trill in exactly that way that the whole sound atmosphere dramaturgy of her recordings  have just slightly become those of the past   is it bitter does her soul tell her  that she was an idiot ever to think anything material wholly could satisfy   perhaps it saysthe only way to escape the history of styles is not to have a body                            when i open my eyes in the morning my great mystery stands before me   i know that i am intelligent therefore  the inability not to fear food dayandnight this unending hunger ten minutes after i have eaten  a childish dread of eating hunger which can have no cause  half my mind says that all this is demeaning  bread for days on end drives all real thought from my brain   then i think no the ideal of being thin  conceals the ideal not to have a body which is not trivial   this wish seems now as much a “given” of my existence  as the intolerable fact that i am darkcomplexioned bigboned and once weighed one hundred and sixtyfive pounds   but then i thinkno that’s too simple  without a body who can know himself at all only by acting choosing rejecting have i made myself discovered who and what ellen can be   but then again i thinkno this i is anterior to name gender action fashion matter itself   trying to stop my hunger with food is like trying to appease thirst with ink                            march 30 result of the consultation both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than i all three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manicdepressive psychosis and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible we therefore resolved to give in to the patient’s demand for discharge                            the trainride yesterday was far worse than i expected   in our compartment were ordinary people a student a woman her child  they had ordinary bodies pleasant faces but i thought i was surrounded by creatures  with the pathetic desperate desire to be not what they were  the student was short and carried his body as if forcing it to be taller  the woman showed her gums when she smiled and often held her hand up to hide them  the child seemed to cry simply because it was small a dwarf and helpless   i was hungry i had insisted that my husband not bring food   after about thirty minutes the woman peeled an orange  to quiet the child she put a

 this is not fantasy this is our life we are the characters who have invaded the moon who cannot stop their computers we are the gods who can unmake the world in seven days  both hands are stopped at noon we are beginning to live forever in lightweight aluminum bodies with numbers stamped on our backs we dial our words like muzak we hear each other through water  the genre is dead invent something new invent a man and a woman naked in a garden invent a child that will save the world a man who carries his father out of a burning city invent a spool of thread that leads a hero to safety invent an island on which he abandons the woman who saved his life with no loss of sleep over his betrayal  invent us as we were before our bodies glittered and we stopped bleeding invent a shepherd who kills a giant a girl who grows into a tree a woman who refuses to turn her back on the past and is changed to salt a boy who steals his brother’s birthright and becomes the head of a nation invent real tears hard love slowspoken ancient words difficult as a child’s first steps across a room

 when i was a boy he says the sky began burning amp someone ran knocking on our door one night the house became birds in the eaves too low for a boys ears  i heard a girl talking but they werent words i knew one good thing a girl was somewhere in our house speaking slow as a sailors parrot  i glimpsed alice in wonderland her voice smelled like an orange though id never peeled an orange i knocked on the walls in a circle  the voice was almost america my ears plucked a word out of the air she said friend i eased open the door hidden behind overcoats in a closet  the young woman was smiling at me she was teaching herself a language to take her far far away amp she taught me a word each day to keep secret  but one night i woke to other voices in the house a commotion downstairs amp a pleading there are promises made at night that turn into stones at daybreak  from my window i saw the stars burning in the river brighter than a big celebration i waited for her return with my hands over my mouth  i cant say her name because it was dangerous in our house so close to the water was she a boys makebelieve friend or a beehive breathing inside the walls  years later my aunts said two german soldiers shot the girl one night beside the vistula this is how i learned your language it was long ago it was springtime

 1   her story is a part of something larger it is a part of history no her story is an illumination  of history the matchstick lit in the black seam of time or no her story is separate  from the whole as distinct as each person is distinct from the stream of people that led  to the one and leads past the one or her story is surrounded by history the ambient spaciousness  of which she is the momentary foreground maybe history is a net through which  just about everything passes and the pieces of her story are particles caught in the interstices  or her story is a contradiction something ordinary that has no part in history at all if history is  about what is included what is made important history is the galleon in the middle  of the pacific ocean in the middle of the sixteenth

 my house’s stairway is seized with vertigo matter having forsaken its laws we land in hell ascending to heaven  shadows move along ladders under the silence of ordinary things there is another silence it belongs neither to the leaves nor to the dead    with a crown of birds circling him a child is running in an abandoned house the stairway takes the measure of its own emptiness  i myself am the stairway that time has used in its funeral course    wheels lift water in the gardens of hama and come down not waiting for the river to put out the fire  here we are left with the river seine and paris’s poisons i prefer gardens where linden trees get ready for a lunar voyage   the stairway that separates my room from my memory whispers in my ear      i am not at the mercy of men since trees live in my fantasies men and trees long for fire and call for the rain i love rains which carry desires to oceans  between one airplane and another space is disoriented stars sneak into holes and brides go naked to wells   their innocence wanes under our eyes you and i are made from a wormeaten wood   the word has sunk we are left with no cry   gesture or gaze silence to us is forbidden   we are threatened neither by life nor by death nor forced to admire the spring   i found earthcastles on the edge of the desert’s torrents i took their marble stairs but could not find my way either up or down then i understood that i was in a state of nonreason and nonmadness and that the gardens of andalusia were standing ready to die  two cities               two tears let insanity keep between its skirts legs within its black eyes the fright of my adolescence and the nocturnal walk on the hills which hill i mean the kingdom that a man carries in his gut when his love’s fulfilled   two cities which are neither beirut nor damascus two tears neither of alcohol nor of rain yes there has been a truck and a blueeyed woman from russia grey olive tree i was a butterfly caught by a fire neither the day’s not the night’s but the incandescence that radiates from the body like a receding sickness let tombs stay open   the stairway which leads to my room borrows its metals from babylon the prophet’s ascension had two movements we fell into whirlpools of mud and the wind followed his horse a tempest went after the sun’s steps the prophet swam through waves of clouds a river of gold carried his vessel and away from the sun he reached paradise a paradise made of light the stairway which leads to my room leads to an observatory i own two telescopes to observe stars and black holes and take mechanized stairs which advance with no advance my hair spins with sunflowers  illegitimate is this linden tree which shakes by my door let us get ready for hell  cursed be messengers tossing about water’s tranquility and building forest fences oh that the wind go quicker than us that we be smothered by light   this linden tree standing by my door weights heavy on my days i will finally marry it and we shall bring children condemned to terror this tree looks at me with insistence it will be kept waiting until time’s end

 where the bead speaks my uncle was the prophetic one throwing his beads this way and that diving foretelling warnings galore sweet promising one eye on the past four to the future half a dozen or more for now he was good if the news was good for evil news we blamed the beads  made from bones or fashioned glass cut out from stones or beaten brass  it’s the many human hours sister it’s the sweat and blood brother which makes the bead a thing apart from precious diamonds opals and gold  turn them this way shake them that way see how they shine incandescent see how they glow in a million hues  elegant and enchanting bead flowered flawed folded or fielded you are the true frame of our feasts your festivals fetes and fiestas  give me a bead that’s wrapped in joy find me a bead to carry my grief we sing of beads and sing with beads just see how well they show on us  beads are the zeze of our joyous trails the ziz of life when all else fails beads are zany zesty zingy the greatest zaiku a grief zapper  speak to me of beads grandma speak to me talk to me of beads nana talk to me  she brightened up immediately she looked at me with a welcome smile grandma pulled up a stool and sat she listened well to me and asked  “you want a tale on beads do you you want a tale or two i’ll tell a tale or two to you but to speak to you of every bead  in words that sing and dance like them you and i shall surely need more than my life in hours and days more than your life in weeks and years  a million lifetimes is not much if beads are the theme the thought the thing we dive for beads we swim we float we mine for beads we comb the woods  koli beads for the infant on his wrist and on her waist cascades of white beads for the mother a very fitting celebrant  there are beads that are tame like what welcomed baby here there are beads that are wild lion’s teeth lightning struck and there are beads around my waist for only my and my dotdot’s eyes  have you seen my love tonight asked the ardent warrior youth light of step curved like a bow her eyes were wonders to behold  she was oiled and very clean she was powdered like a queen she wore a sarong of the purest silk her toes were nestled in their thongs  have you seen my love tonight she who wore gold beads in her hair then the pretty maiden asked who has seen my love tonight  who has seen my warrior brave he had said no more to war he had buried his arrowhead his girdle was free of blood and sweat  he was adorned in his very best he was oiled like a king with beads of silver in his hair who has seen my love tonight  they welcome us here in the palest white and bid us farewell in black sometimes blue and brown and red metallic green or indigo  there are beads by far the most that are polished tarred and feathered there are beads worked over and under elegant hued thin and narrow  beads are the zaffered the zingiest the zenith of all great times  cool calm and forever collected clawed clayed or colored constantly changing bead you are the best you are the greatest  so don’t talk to me of the chevron don’t ever talk of it don’t break my ears on the chevron don’t break my ears  as barter for my life and yours no gem on earth could fit the bill not gold and if not even gold then what on earth is chevron  i dread the chevron it was a weapon of oppression and not at all    a bead  seven whole humans for one bead and what kind of trade was that a layer each of sand and mud for the lives of our kinsmen  so what if it was one and not seven one soul for a shiny piece of bead this sounds like the greatest greed this sounds like utter foolishness  don’t talk to me of the chevron don’t even mention it don’t break my ears on the chevron don’t break my ears  they say that cheap beads prattle rattle and tattle but great beads never talk  yet if a string of beads is fine it sings it dances it jumps and sizzles  if a string of beads is truly fine it can speak in a million tongues it will have something for all and say the most amazing things  and every now and every then every bead laughs out aloud there are beads that are smaller than the hopes of a mean mind  though called bodom as in a dog poochy pug puggy pooch bodom beads they are so big they are the elephants of the pack they lead the way and announce the day  the nature of beads is a mystery the how of it the feel the glow of earthly gems the least and most our first and true try to create to beautify our human selves  the best of doors to human hearts our spirit’s window to the world beads clothe our woes in vivid color beads like angels plead for us  beads can lift the heaviest heart and like tea and precious brews beads can warm us when we are cold and cool us when we are hot  blessed are the beads that bring us peace spare us o lord in this lifetime beads of war chaos and strife  no beaded strings of calamities earthquakes floods and famine no veritable tsunamis of woe keep us cool and keep us warm  for each color in the rainbow there is a bead somewhere on earth a million years old if a day or shy in its newsness and done this dawn  blue beads green beads yellow beads and grey black beads white beads red beads and brown  your rise from heaps of your own ash with more of you than ever were you bead are an awesome one you are the phoenix of the years  their making uses endless hours the how the when the what of it the wearing is by a billion souls whichever way however much and everywhere     mined and molten manmade wonder raw organic or cooked and dried forever treasured forever prized  bettered and bartered broken and beaten burnt or badgered bruised and bloodied  you are the neverleftbehind oldest ordered owned invention pure and precious polished pearl still safe sacred scraped or scratched  traded treated tough in trouble unique unmatched unbreakable verdant velvet virginal as rain beads are virile vestal vain  gilded and golden there can be no palanquin if you are not sitting with the king you are the queen the soul and spirit within  beads are deserving beads are worthy wash me some beads to warm my skin a token of love a gift for my kin  hollowed and hallowed jingled jangled

 “the conquest is not sustainable   ”  winona laduke  thanks for bringing that to our attention she said the first time to my response to a history text about a famous painting of the battle of quebec that never mentioned the french and only mentioned indians twice once as nuisances once as the noble savage kneeling by the dying english general  this was during the french and indian war i said soon thousands of french and indian people would be displaced sold into indentured servitude my own family among them there would be bounties on the heads of abenaki people in maine and the english would sow the fields of the mohawks with salt  thanks for bringing that up she said  the next book mentioned cannibals in the caribbean indians who believed the spanish were gods indians killing themselves indian women in love with spanish pricks indians whose names even when known were passed over in favor of the ones given them by the spanish  stop writing about indians she told me you’re making everyone feel guilty  but the next book was back in maine home territory the diary of a midwife right after that same french and indian war and she was using herbs not found in english herbals and wrote that a “young squaw” visited her over a period of three weeks but  the famous historian said only that there may have been indians in the area while she wrote at length about white men dressing up as indians to protest against the rich stealing their lands  stop writing about indians she told me again only louder as if i was hard of hearing you have to allow authors their subjects she said stop writing about what isn’t in the text  which is just our entire history  this week she said i’m really upset you’re telling the same story three times because there’s only one story about indians and we all know what it is so i asked her if there are an infinite number of stories about white people and she told me to stop being racist  so i stayed away from class for a week because they were reading a book about a mystery in the everglades and i knew there had to be indians in that swamp and i didn’t want to have to write about indians again  it was on to the next book written she said by a cherokee writer which leslie silko who is laguna will be interested to find out because the book was ceremony but that is a small mistake sort of like saying that dante is chinese so i overlooked it  now she told me write about indians  and i might have done that except she went on about indians putting on a mask of whiteness like white people put on black face and some of the students wrote it down in their notebooks and everyone started talking about minstrel shows  then she wanted me to tell her if there is such a thing as an indian world view and i said well yes and no which i figured was safe since i would be at least halfright whichever answer she wanted but when i mentioned the european world view she said there isn’t any such thing which was quite a relief to me i hate to think there were a whole lot of people thinking in hierarchies and as if the earth is a dead object and animals and plants and some people not having spirit then she said i’d better stick to what i know that is indians which is what i was trying to do in the first place and that maybe european philosophy was too much for my primitive brain in spite of its being my undergraduate major and i pointed out that the oppressed always know more about the oppressor than vice versa so she just glared at me and told me that i look scandinavian  which was a surprise to me and i wondered why i never was a prom queen since it was always the scandinavian girls who got that honor maybe they never noticed i was one of them exactly how much indian are you anyway she asked i told her i guessed i was pretty much indian i suppose she wondered why i wouldn’t accept that mask of whiteness she kept talking about as myself

 a famous battle happened in this valley you never understood the nature poem till now till this momentif these statements seem separate unrelated follow this  silence to its edge and you will hear the history of air the crispness of a fern or the upward cut and turn around of a fieldfare or thrush written on it  the other history is silent the estuary is over there the issue was decided here two kings prepared to give no quarter then one king and one dead tradition  now the humid dusk the old wounds wait for language for a different truth when you see the silk of the willow and the wider edge of the river turn  and grow dark and then darker then you will know that the nature poem is not the action nor its end it is this rust on the gate beside the trees on  the cattle grid underneath our feet on the steering wheel shaft it is an aftermath an overlay and even in its own modest way an art of peace  i try the word distance and it fills with sycamores a summers worth of pollen and as i write valley straw metal blood oaths armour are unwritten  silence spreads slowly from these words to those ilex trees half in half out of shadows falling on the shallow ford of the south bank beside yellow island  as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion begins to be complete what we see is what the poem says evening comingcattle cattleshadows  and whin bushes and a change of weather about to change them all what we see is how the place and the torment of the place are for this moment free of one another

 love thou are absolute sole lord of life and death to prove the word we’ll now appeal to none of all those thy old soldiers great and tall ripe men of martyrdom that could reach down with strong arms their triumphant crown such as could with lusty breath speak loud into the face of death their great lord’s glorious name to none of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne for love at large to fill spare blood and sweat and see him take a private seat making his mansion in the mild and milky soul of a soft child  scarce has she learn’d to lisp the name of martyr yet she thinks it shame life should so long play with that breath which spent can buy so brave a death she never undertook to know what death with love should have to do nor has she e’er yet understood why to show love she should shed blood yet though she cannot tell you why she can love and she can die  scarce has she blood enough to make a guilty sword blush for her sake yet has she’a heart dares hope to prove how much less strong is death than love  be love but there let poor six years be pos’d with the maturest fears man trembles at you straight shall find love knows no nonage nor the mind ’tis love not years or limbs that can make the martyr or the man  love touch’d her heart and lo it beats high and burns with such brave heats such thirsts to die as dares drink up a thousand cold deaths in one cup good reason for she breathes all fire her weak breast heaves with strong desire of what she may with fruitless wishes seek for amongst her mother’s kisses  since ’tis not to be had at home she’ll travel to a martyrdom no home for hers confesses she but where she may a martyr be  she’ll to the moors and trade with them for this unvalued diadem she’ll offer them her dearest breath with christ’s name in ’t in change for death she’ll bargain with them and will give them god teach them how to live in him or if they this deny for him she’ll teach them how to die so shall she leave amongst them sown her lord’s blood or at least her own  farewell then all the world adieu teresa is no more for you farewell all pleasures sports and joys never till now esteemed toys farewell whatever dear may be mother’s arms or father’s knee farewell house and farewell home she’s for the moors and martyrdom  sweet not so fast lo thy fair spouse whom thou seek’st with so swift vows calls thee back and bids thee come t’ embrace a milder martyrdom  blest powers forbid thy tender life should bleed upon a barbarous knife or some base hand have power to rase thy breast’s chaste cabinet and uncase a soul kept there so sweet oh no wise heav’n will never have it so thou art love’s victim and must die a death more mystical and high into love’s arms thou shalt let fall a stillsurviving funeral he is the dart must make the death whose stroke shall taste thy hallow’d breath a dart thrice dipp’d in that rich flame which writes thy spouse’s radiant name upon the roof of heav’n where aye it shines and with a sovereign ray beats bright upon the burning faces of souls which in that name’s sweet graces find everlasting smiles so rare so spiritual pure and fair must be th’ immortal instrument upon whose choice point shall be sent a life so lov’d and that there be fit executioners for thee the fair’st and firstborn sons of fire blest seraphim shall leave their quire and turn love’s soldiers upon thee to exercise their archery  oh how oft shalt thou complain of a sweet and subtle pain of intolerable joys of a death in which who dies loves his death and dies again and would forever so be slain and lives and dies and knows not why to live but that he thus may never leave to die  how kindly will thy gentle heart kiss the sweetlykilling dart and close in his embraces keep those delicious wounds that weep balsam to heal themselves with thus when these thy deaths so numerous shall all at last die into one and melt thy soul’s sweet mansion like a soft lump of incense hasted by too hot a fire and wasted into perfuming clouds so fast shalt thou exhale to heav’n at last in a resolving sigh and then o what ask not the tongues of men angels cannot tell suffice thyself shall feel thine own full joys and hold them fast forever there so soon as thou shalt first appear the moon of maiden stars thy white mistress attended by such bright souls as thy shining self shall come and in her first ranks make thee room where ’mongst her snowy family immortal welcomes wait for thee  o what delight when reveal’d life shall stand and teach thy lips heav’n with his hand on which thou now mayst to thy wishes heap up thy consecrated kisses what joys shall seize thy soul when she bending her blessed eyes on thee those second smiles of heav’n shall dart her mild rays through thy melting heart  angels thy old friends there shall greet thee glad at their own home now to meet thee  all thy good works which went before and waited for thee at the door shall own thee there and all in one weave a constellation of crowns with which the king thy spouse shall build up thy triumphant brows  all thy old woes shall now smile on thee and thy pains sit bright upon thee all thy sorrows here shall shine all thy suff’rings be divine tears shall take comfort and turn gems and wrongs repent to diadems ev’n thy deaths shall live and new dress the soul that erst they slew thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars as keep account of the lamb’s wars  those rare works where thou shalt leave writ love’s noble history with wit taught thee by none but him while here they feed our souls shall clothe thine there each heav’nly word by whose hid flame our hard hearts shall strike fire the same shall flourish on thy brows and be both fire to us and flame to thee whose light shall live bright in thy face by glory in our hearts by grace  thou shalt look round about and see thousands of crown’d souls throng to be themselves thy crown sons of thy vows the virginbirths with which thy sovereign spouse made fruitful thy fair soul go now and with them all about thee bow to him “put on” he’ll say “put on my rosy love that thy rich zone sparkling with the sacred flames of thousand souls whose happy names heav’n keeps upon thy score thy bright life brought them first to kiss the light that kindled them to stars” and so thou with the lamb thy lord shalt go and wheresoe’er he sets his white steps walk with him those ways of light which who in death would live to see must learn in life to die like thee

 mangled uncared for suffering thro’ the night with heavenly patience the poor boy had lain under the dreary shadows left and right groaned on the wounded stiffened out the slain what faith sustained his lone brave heart to make no moan to send no cry from that bloodsprinkled sod is a close mystery with him and god  but when the light came and the morning dew glittered around him like a golden lake and every dripping flower with deepened hue looked through its tears for very pity’s sake he moved his aching head upon his rugged bed and smiled as a blue violet virginmeek laid her pure kiss upon his withered cheek  at once there circled in his waking heart a thousand memories of distant home of how those same blue violets would start along his native fields and some would roam down his dear humming brooks to hide in secret nooks and shyly met in nodding circles swing like gossips murmuring at belated spring  and then he thought of the beloved hands that with his own had plucked the modest flower the blueeyed maiden crowned with golden bands who ruled as sovereign of that sunny hour she at whose soft command he joined the mustering band she for whose sake he lay so firm and still despite his pangs not questioned then her will  so lost in thought scarce conscious of the deed culling the violets here and there he crept slowlyah slowlyfor his wound would bleed and the sweet flowers themselves half smiled half wept to be thus gathered in by hands so pale and thin by fingers trembling as they neatly laid stem upon stem and bound them in a braid  the strangest posy ever fashioned yet was clasped against the bosom of the lad as we the seekers for the wounded set his form upon our shoulders bowed and sad though he but seemed to think how violets nod and wink and as we cheered him for the path was wild he only looked upon his flowers and smiled

the molson’s sign and burrard street bridge and i could watch the west end and highrises and planetarium grow and white sheets on a clothesline across the street dry as i’d sit at my bay window and write and mark on a smooth board cut to fit exactly the sill  i’d glance up and see people like  you  amp  jamie  amp  carol  amp  joan  amp  marcia  amp the trumans and the gadds  and the lathams

dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder dancing in the other to another drumming in the kitchen talking in the room with the bluetile fireplace so many bodies i couldnt hear the music from  inside the  hallway just saw the taller heads moving together to different beats in almost darkness  that crazy night at the wahs’ place if that wasnt a party of this kind everybody landing on that bed everybody kissing everybody we had to go outside to pee because the lineup for the can so long  somehow to do with that small space that it was so tight that everybody had to rub every body simply to go anywhere it was gorgeous  after the vancouver poetry conference 1963 roy kiyooka started dropping by   when he left his studio there’d always be a light on somewhere in our building and he could visit  any of us separately or clustered  one time he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me but it was big and heavy he borrowed a truck and someone helped him up the dusty always dirty long stairs with hoarfrost which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold my round oak table used to be bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for 80 and when they moved they gave it to joan and then when she moved she stored it with me a wall that later elsa and i tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer shouting angry hexes at robert all the way  after and

walking back with an economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend ray wargo would get stopped almost every

directly than he has in the past i like many others including every gay man i know do have a crush on him he has much more style than any canadian politician so far i mean style in the true sense of the word it is him not affected… cliff of course doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell out i don’t go that far yet but i do think that compromising is the only way a politician can work this country and i do not like all the pr razzmatazz fundraising and allegiances that go into just getting elected our system seems to be based on gullibility…”   coming home at night up yew street whether

 a story of holland the good dame looked from her cottage at the close of the pleasant day and cheerily called to her little son outside the door at play “come peter come i want you to go while there is light to see to the hut of the blind old man who lives across the dike for me and take these cakes i made for him they are hot and smoking yet you have time enough to go and come before the sun is set”  then the goodwife turned to her labor humming a simple song and thought of her husband working hard at the sluices all day long and set the turf ablazing and brought the coarse black bread that he might find a fire at night and find the table spread  and peter left the brother with whom all day he had played and the sister who had watched their sports in the willow’s tender shade and told them they ’d see him back before they saw a star in sight though he would n’t be afraid to go in the very darkest night for he was a brave bright fellow with eye and conscience clear he could do whatever a boy might do and he had not learned to fear why he would n’t have robbed a bird’s nest nor brought a stork to harm though never a law in holland had stood to stay his arm  and now with his face all glowing and eyes as bright as the day with the thoughts of his pleasant errand he trudged along the way and soon his joyous prattle made glad a lonesome place alas if only the blind old man could have seen that happy face yet he somehow caught the brightness which his voice and presence lent and he felt the sunshine come and go as peter came and went  and now as the day was sinking and the winds began to rise the mother looked from her door again shading her anxious eyes and saw the shadows deepen and birds to their homes come back but never a sign of peter along the level track but she said “he will come at morning so i need not fret or grieve though it is n’t like my boy at all to stay without my leave”  but where was the child delaying on the homeward way was he and across the dike while the sun was up an hour above the sea he was stopping now to gather flowers now listening to the sound as the angry waters dashed themselves against their narrow bound “ah well for us” said peter “that the gates are good and strong and my father tends them carefully or they would not hold you long you ’re a wicked sea” said peter “i know why you fret and chafe you would like to spoil our lands and homes but our sluices keep you safe”  but hark through the noise of waters comes a low clear trickling sound and the child’s face pales with terror and his blossoms drop to the ground he is up the bank in a moment and stealing through the sand he sees a stream not yet so large as his slender childish hand ’t is a leak in the dike he is but a boy unused to fearful scenes but young as he is he has learned to know the dreadful thing that means a leak in the dike the stoutest heart grows faint that cry to hear and the bravest man in all the land turns white with mortal fear for he knows the smallest leak may grow to a flood in a single night and he knows the strength of the cruel sea when loosed in its angry might  and the boy he has seen the danger and shouting a wild alarm he forces back the weight of the sea with the strength of his single arm he listens for the joyful sound of a footstep passing nigh and lays his ear to the ground to catch the answer to his cry and he hears the rough winds blowing and the waters rise and fall but never an answer comes to him save the echo of his call he sees no hope no succor his feeble voice is lost yet what shall he do but watch and wait though he perish at his post  so faintly calling and crying till the sun is under the sea crying and moaning till the stars come out for company he thinks of his brother and sister asleep in their safe warm bed he thinks of his father and mother of himself as dyingand dead and of how when the night is over they must come and find him at last but he never thinks he can leave the place where duty holds him fast  the good dame in the cottage is up and astir with the light for the thought of her little peter has been with her all night and now she watches the pathway as yester eve she had done but what does she see so strange and black against the rising sun her neighbors are bearing between them something straight to her door her child is coming home but not as he ever came before  “he is dead” she cries “my darling” and the startled father hears and comes and looks the way she looks and fears the thing she fears till a glad shout from the bearers thrills the stricken man and wife “give thanks for your son has saved our land and god has saved his life” so there in the morning sunshine they knelt about the boy and every head was bared and bent in tearful reverent joy  ’t is many a year since then but still when the sea roars like a flood their boys are taught what a boy can do who is brave and true and good for every man in that country takes his son by the hand and tells him of little peter whose courage saved the land  they have many a valiant hero remembered through the years but never one whose name so oft is named with loving tears and his deed shall be sung by the cradle and told to the child on the knee so long as the dikes of holland divide the land from the sea

 in chicago it is snowing softly and a man has just done his wash for the week he steps into the twilight of early evening carrying a wrinkled shopping bag full of neatly folded clothes and for a moment enjoys the feel of warm laundry and crinkled paper flannellike against his gloveless hands there’s a rembrandt glow on his face a triangle of orange in the hollow of his cheek as a last flash of sunset blazes the storefronts and lit windows of the street  he is asian thai or vietnamese and very skinny dressed as one of the poor in rumpled suit pants and a plaid mackinaw dingy and too large he negotiates the slick of ice on the sidewalk by his car opens the fairlane’s back door leans to place the laundry in and turns for an instant toward the flurry of footsteps and cries of pedestrians as a boythat’s all he was backs from the corner package store shooting a pistol firing it once at the dumbfounded man who falls forward grabbing at his chest  a few sounds escape from his mouth a babbling no one understands as people surround him bewildered at his speech the noises he makes are nothing to them the boy has gone lost in the light array of foot traffic dappling the snow with fresh prints tonight i read about descartes’ grand courage to doubt everything except his own miraculous existence and i feel so distinct from the wounded man lying on the concrete i am ashamed  let the night sky cover him as he dies let the weaver girl cross the bridge of heaven and take up his cold hands    in memory of jay kashiwamura

 it is easily forgotten year to year exactly where the plot is though the place is entirely familiar a willow tree by a curving roadway sweeping black asphalt with tender leaves  damp grass strewn with flower boxes canvas chairs darkskinned old ladies circling in draped black crepe family stones fingers cramped red at the knuckles discolored nails fresh soil for new plants old rosaries  such fingers kneading the damp earth gently down on new roots black humus caught in grey hair brushed back and the single waterfaucet birdlike upon its grey pipe stem a stream opening at its foot  we know the stories that are told by starts and stops by bent men at strange joy regarding the precise enactments of their own gesturing and among the women there will be a naming of families a counting off an ordering  the morning may be brilliant the season is one of brilliancessunlight through the fountained willow behind us its splayed shadow spreading westward our shadows westward irregular across damp grass the closeset stones  it may be that since our walk there is faltering moving in careful steps around snowonthemountain bluebells and zebragrass toward that place between the willow and the waterfaucet the way is lost that we have no practiced step there and walking our own sway and balance fails us

 nowhere in those kerosene years could she find a softheaded match  the wife crosses over an ocean redfaced and cheerless trades the flat pad of a stethoscope for a dining hall spatula  life is two choices she thinks you hatch a life or you pass through one  photographs of a child swaddled in layers arrive by post money doesn’t to her embarrassment  over time she grows out her hair then she sprouts nerves the wife was no fool but neither did she wander  she lives inside a season of thrift which stretches on her sorrow has thickness and a certain sheen  the wife knows to hurry when she washes when she cooks she licks spoons slowly  every night she made a dish with ground pork paired with a dish that was fibrous

 i wanted to go to military school and march i wanted to grow up and be composed and expert with a rifle with tactics and fighting to be safe and courageous among men in barracks and on the battlefield i wanted to see my arms hairy and corded with muscle at the end of rolled up khaki sleeves i wanted to flex my feet in boots and look down at the the dust of battles dimming the leather surfaces the blood slick on the rim of the soles i wanted the smell of gunpowder in my nostrils the grime on my face the washedout hollow love for my comrades found in the foxholes the sad understanding the requiems of late afternoons walking away from the burial site with the widow as she cradled the triangulated flag like a plowblade in her arms

 i  the whole of human history …  the whole of human history seems to be the story of men who kill and of men who are killed of murderers who light their cigarettes with trembling hands and of poor unlucky kids staring into the eyes of those who bring them their deaths  but history is not about murderers after all it is just the story of some poor kids the whole history of the world is just the story of millions of poor kids overwhelmed by the fear of death or by the fear of bringing death to others  my mother had closed her eyes and was breathing softly every so often her right hand abandoned on the white sheet would shift slightly opening and closing like the hand of a sleeping baby  the nurse came into the room just then as i had begun to tell the story of jaco she opened the door as slowly as possible but i felt her presence behind my shoulders bending over the bed looking at my mother  she is sleeping said the nurse dont wake her  i didnt turn around but continued my story in a low whisper when i got to the part about the grenade i heard the nurse tiptoeing out closing the door behind her  silently  the grenade exploded a few feet away while jaco was helping to carry two wounded soldiers down the hill to the hospital tent by the time i got to him he was stretched out on the grass breathing heavily everyone around him had been killed he watched as i approached and when i was close he smiled he had just been promoted to lieutenant even though he had not yet turned nineteen six months ago when we were getting ready to leave italy ercolani had taken me aside and saidlook out for jaco hes like a brother to me make sure nothing bad happens to him i was irritatedwar isnt a game it doesnt play by the rules if something bad happens to him tough luck but from that day on i kept my eye on jacoboni he was about the same age as me but seemed much younger in any event he turned out to be a good officer he did his duty like all the others like a good kid he took war seriously convinced he would go home in one piece back to his family in monterotondo near rome and it was perhaps because of this that he smiled as i sat down next to him i saw right away that it was hopeless the grenade had torn open his abdomen and his intestines were cascading down his leg past his knees and coiling onto the ground we were surrounded by the dead hundreds of them in the forest around us most were italian but there were a few germans they had advanced this far before we had finally pushed them back their dead lay alongside ours  it began to rain  the rain on the oak leaves made a soft music like women whispering every so often it would intensify as it darted here and there through the trees rising and then fading away  the green reflection of the forest washed everything the color of water gave an extraordinary lightness to things to the solid trunks of the trees to the bodies lying in the grass  glimpsed through the branches of the trees the sky appeared light and remote a sky made of silk luminous and pure serene scrubbed of clouds and fog  the rain was coming from who knows where or maybe it was not even rain just the memory of some rain falling from the depths of past summers falling from some childhood summer long ago

 afternoon darkens into evening a man falls deeper and deeper into the slow spiral of sleep into the drift of it the length of it through what feels like mist and comes at last to an open door through which he passes without knowing why then again without knowing why goes to a room where he sits and waits while the room seems to close around him and the dark is darker than any he has known and he feels something forming within him without being sure what it is its hold on him growing as if a story were about to unfold in which two characters pleasure and pain commit the same crime the one that is his that he will confess to again and again until it means nothing

 the sunlight was not our concern or even the pane it shone through and no one was going down for the mail and the four lettuces the gardener brought as a gift seemed to be a calculated bounty so that early on we knew we were going to be stuck with ourselves the rest of the day the vicissitudes marching in rows from the forest the balms not arriving till nightfall on the prowl since morning the wind had a touch too much of motivation an annoying way of exactly ruffling the same oak leaf as if it were practicing a piano trill all day repetitive birds far off were either boring themselves to death or drunk on instinct doing their thing ritual dances territorial rites the whole imperial egg what nests ambition is weaving in us is hard to say after the flat occasion the unshared sphere each childish wish grows hopeless finding this is what the world is for this the recommended cures are useless a cheery hello to the disaffected at breakfast a soupful of tears at dinner you could spill the whole silly story out to one more demanding illtempered beauty you happened to meet at the a amp p and still every greedy shopping cart first overstuffed and then abandoned in the parking lot would leave in its wake some human need ignored halfstarved    torn between having nothing to say and saying it whole diaries get down how terrible to have dressed beautifully for the rain    i was launched on new york’s bisexual muddle

 i  tripartite schemes were all very well for the builders who held their blueprints firmly in hand beforehand what did it matter if the two vertical poles didn’t touch seemed so far apart in fact that no one who visited the site could believe the architect’s arrogant babble before they knew it he’d bridged the two poles with a plank  i have hidden under these structures of synthetic comfort when the sky was overcast i have even hired a claque of unemployed actors  to stand there with me but speaking for myself i find their tentlike charm diminishing over on the next hill is a line of pokerfaced upright slabs their bases deep in the dirt their function something else entirely   ii  i keep seeking this pleasuregiving eye mote you fill your pew and my view with golden uncontrollable emanation and the music surges in response a coded story of hope and disappointment decipherable to the few is it wrong to be overheated here or not to have left my coat at the entrance  the only crime would be not to swoon to see and ignore you or brand you a brother in spotless devotion beneath the bleeding windows hearts must have heft masses of skin become human tremors to feel the force of the organ on its own the rite is a starchy obligation add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples   iii  over the hub of the hill a solid wall of silver leaves underfoot soil without burrows blanketing soil and leaves a scrim of hushed and unpunctured blue then all of a sudden rumors of something about to happen the night restless with its own unkeepable secrets the very air strained and achingly electric  because you are not here nighttime behaves this way calling for terms i’d long since put away susurration intrigue reverberant it is only in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings can sing your praises so i curse even as i gape to know that their raving requires your being anywhere else the evening hums in compensation   iv  his beak is open as if in midworm or midsentence his feet impressively sturdy as they straddle the street what gives him away though is the magenta pool spreading rapidly under this otherwise unruffled stomach something ended this bird so suddenly that he never had time to strike a normal death pose  it would be overdone and untrue to say i am the bird to paint myself in similar terms as stunted irretrievably downed forever rooted to unkind ground it would smack of selfpity we are partners instead beneath a general rubric of doom an arrow descended and brought him startled to death me screamingly to life   v  i loved a statue and watered it daily sooner or later it softened and let me break a vital part of it off with my hardwon prize in my pocket i explored the streets with a secret but before long the plundered piece was dust in my hands and painful to look at  now another effigy makes me shudder at its criminal threshold more than ever i entertain a shameless urge to steal or caress it but the facts of history tell me otherwise you get what you pray for and the statue dwindles to rubble   vi  although others lack the sharpened knives to be villains they do what they can with blunter instruments sparring to kill time falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them they get their day’s entertainment from instruction manuals bought at auctions when one utters his bored “touché” a gaggle of fans surround him  how much deadlier is your collection of swords with a history scimitars that glint even when strung up and inactive although i would gladly lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of thrustandparry you have no need of anything resembling aid one twist of your weapon outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers   vii  the avuncular figure with grizzled beard the bearer of balm for the stricken and abandoned the craggy but spirited sicklecarrier paces the page of a longforgotten book of days and never once frowns there is no need to our days may be numbered but    and here his eyes mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows  his evil twin wants none of this waiting this starryeyed torpor hoping to scare eternity into submission he too brandishes a sickle but everything goes wrong he pierces his own leg and must go on crutches before long he falls into childish fits of selfpity proffering sickle and leg to hirelings saying “lop it off boys and be quick”   viii  during the first stages of frenzy a glut of meaning descends on nature as if to spite cynics who call dirt nothing but dirt terrific breezes mere conveyors of pollen something in the sufferer’s mind seeks out and finds corroboration in vast planets and puny insects all are as prone to nervous tics all whirring with badly kept secrets  time passes and the system turn on you when all is sacred nothing is safe silent lampposts suddenly pipe up in irresistible  colloquy a tone too high the sky calls you but does not want your replies and waterbound birds decline pronouns in latin it is a hotbed that cannot stand the addition of an offending presence it whispers until you are well on your way   ix  before you came on the scene and blasted the image to bits i thought of love as a spacious courtroom where evidence was presented graphically and up front where deserving plaintiffs got what they wanted legally and where judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw happy verdicts amicably arrived at  these days law is something to be left at the door along with galoshes i spend my nights in sinister mocktrial playing all the parts “guilty or not” booms our potbellied exquisitely bored judge i answer for you “not your holiness this harridan framed me” and then i object and then hunched over in a corner of the courtroom a juror suggests we all go out to lunch   x  it was a run of the mill journey until the windows seemed to have melted outside the train the foliage of early summer received an instantaneous drenching startled i thought of you like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance “holding her heart agawp at nature’s rages she would watch the storm from inside and secretly like it”  no longer dainty handtothehead the tragic meaningful stare out the window no storm buffets alone however stunningly leaves may shudder and press against the pane it is a wasted downpour if nobody comes out soggy reaching my stop i left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker and headed for the wet jungle hot on your heels   xi  our meeting is as stiff as a longdead thoroughbred like its former coat we too are glossy and brief no frizzy wire springs up that is not dutifully cropped our every neigh is strictly by the book place us in a lineup of similarly frozen stallions and you will not know one rigor mortis from another and another  i could endure a salvo of kicking a brutish uprearing nag or a vicious race to the finish over this wingless duo of moribund mares i could even stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes in my horse metaphor anything other than the way our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth gorgeous stillborns cynical hasbeens this is no time for pleasantry   xii  i have been dreaming you into the picture when you bound unseeing past me i tingle onward with knees of jelly glad to be confirmed in my scheming this walk is no hopeless ramble but a perfect way of seeing and being seen fate sensing my hopes obligingly guides you outdoors  what rankles is the time it takes me to realize that you are truly tangibly here i have been holding so many secret meetings with you that this brief encounter this perfect opportunity passes doesn’t register i see you in retrospect you were here jacket flapping in the noon breeze and gone by the time i had presence of mind to grasp it   xiii  explaining camouflage a useful way of suiting yourself to your habitat so that you steal its features more than it steals yours in war a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes in love a vanishing act that lets you watch the object of your affection in whose vagrant eyes you might as well be a pebble a flaw on the leaf  or a ruinous selfeffacement brainchild of the timid deserving to be trounced by the rustle in the trees which announces a vital presence the force which storming a fortress subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most cherished beliefs the stunning hybrid you look at once and cannot get out of your mind   xiv  hearing you praised is enough to make my overbaked brain a warpath for feuding goddesses only instead of swords their messages clash each one a model of what i might do on one side silence stately in black shows no sign of unrest her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod  on the other side in seethrough red a goddess named outrage deafens her rival with laudatory overdrive next to her encomia both clean and unclean the excesses of the laurelthrowers positively began to pale it is her manner that somehow filters out the walls start to rumble the floorboards feeble at keeping secrets murmur “swear it”   xv  in the handeddown inventory of love’s habits we find images of lowering down at the mouth down on the knees prostrate with the shock of the marvelous contact more than shamefaced with the elevated figure is therefore impossible hazard more than a bow and a trapdoor opens beneath you offer a hand and see love disappear  there is never a mention of the sudden boost the rundown ego receives when flinging a jest from toadhigh levels it witnesses more than haughty approval nor is it told how the jest some minor impromptu line gets told and retold in the prolonged wake of the moment seraphs laugh at it trees love it you see your dullness shine in another’s eyes   xvi  a dream straight out of a textbook having been tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy hairy faced thug and her henchman i hear the incredible shouts as an old babysitter is disemboweled severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes but i do not think “me next” fearing instead that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess  what can i do on waking but clench my stomach in sharp instinctive need to keep it closed in wars between the hirsute and the nurturing nobody dares to cheer for the former though her company being moody is hellishly more alive will this day or the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of spilling over somewhere the babysitter screams your name   xvii  once a day you report to the resident loony for clues leading to the whereabouts of the author of a love letter you have received she is mad but useful delving as she can into alternate worlds and as you grill her from the other side of the bars a strange bond begins to form between you she seems to have felt as you do  little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless selfpromoter she ladles out counsel “you can tell she wants to be tracked down” and misinformation “i think i know where she lives” like a watery broth that keeps you coming back for the meaty payoff at the bottom all this you realize and tolerate never suspecting that she’s the one you want   xviii  when you are within shouting distance it is no matter or next to none what you say or whether we speak at all it is enough to see and covertly to love your bright array of colorful traits they are no sooner parceled out than stored up secret accounts to be gone over until the whole singlespaced ledger is memorized  but when you leave ledgers cannot contain you time passes and the beloved blurs the riotous gestures faded in substance though not in force i cannot hear your voice if i try and what do i do when a freefloating affection outraces its visible target from your splendid outpost that dazzles merely by being yours send photos   xix  abroad you are a mass of extra shadow falling on all you see on its own a square is stiff and formidable walk in it and the arches tremble the smells from the canal soften and linger the red of the hills at evening is fit for a postcard home until you step in the pictureand hand it back to the masters  it is straight out of a shoddy french novel to squeeze the continents into usthem categories and chaptersmold here fruit there stubble in places and wheat in others think me less a philistine when i say how little the steps of the journey frame you it is you torchbearer to shrouded lands who flood them with living color   xx  when i call you to mind you respond sluggishly if at all it is as if being busy you send a very expensive mannequin in your stead a robot who dresses and walks like you but cannot capture your puzzling essence memory loves paradox the more i require a standin the looser the seams the phonier the puppet  but i do not know this until the unexpected happens sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut i come upon a diamond that puts them to shame catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color in the street i realize the cheapness of the household dolls i have been thinking about relieved that even now surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture   xxi  it will be objected that in missing you i forfeit a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers there an air of resolute calm prevails it is always “our minds are as one and that is enough” or “i saw him last night in the shape of a cloud” or harder still to believe “look at the useful machine i built instead of grieving”  they may brace themselves and speak of the salubrious sublime they may grit their teeth and bear it their tourniqueted hearts are as undone as mine away you are no homing compass or dove but a roving ceaselessly altering scoundrel to miss you is to miss the loot you add to your repository of noises   xxii  horses birds babysitters and jails shadows churches and trains one would think you’d sat up with me all night filling out forms on what images you preferred or at least been consulted in the matter failing that one might suppose you to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror as one by one strange pictures of you took flight  but you stumbled into this mess of blocks like the bumbling idiot in a screwball comedy center stage contained in cardboard boxes you tripped over before smiling and wandering on in your madcap way to new scrapes meanwhile the whirligig thrives in your absence booted cubes swoon for their muse a poltergeist in a bowtie   xxiii  a spider loved a bee and knowing that to trap him would be to kill him devised webs just flashy enough to keep the insect guessing and soon seeing in the spider’s handiwork traces of his own flowerhopping the bee came closer arachnid vapors wafted over them as the bee proposed to die in the spider’s service  “no” screamed the latter tightening up her floss and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed turfroses and lilies next to whom he saw the spider was nothing but she was not so lucky the web she’d spun for him got tangled in her post mortem antennaflailing and finally wound around her neck and choked her it was the end of the fable   xxiv  the more love grows the bigger its sealedoff palace becomes and the more pinched and dark its stoical keeper inside sun breeds space a ray that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it only now there is not one room but many beams bright as lasers but gentler give away the safe behind the painting the corridor under the rug  if only the keeper hardened by circumstance could learn from this endless illumination and turn the room inside out light would then seep through leathery skin giving its secrets away in a gradually spreading glow turning skin the orange of pure beatitude but there are only two options for the keeper to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent   xxv  then any enterprise requiring new clothes was privately hissed if openly hailed too close to a floral militia thinking as one were the standard frills the required rustles and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies i called the clothes by their hidden agendas ethical corsets trusses of the spirit  now i cry out for the colorful front of fancy dress bow down in belated awe before silk and organza it is not the delusion of being at my best but the promise of further secrecy that thrills me these veils only make unveiling all the stranger and wilder and under my gown claw ghosts you’ll never see   xxvi  this sideshow of outlandish images is nothing like the main attractions of another time just after one picture clicks on and the eyes have adjusted another altogether different one takes its place and another and another what in the world is going on did the projector gather together the uppermost slides on the pile  nothing could be falser it is only that the replacement of the reel calls for as many tricks and turns as possible to be an even passable substitute everything is its field its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for things encyclopedic this is the only way it can capture your many anglessmall comfort yet comfort still   xxvii  the next time our paths cross there will be none of this shillyshallying this bondage like it or not to fickle time brute locale the crossing itself will slow down the march of the passing moment with its own unstoppable steam its tenebrous and sultry collection of vapors it will be love in a bottle  but there is always a screw loose somewhere a gap in the glass that lets in a limber array of interlopers from the mutual friend who smells a levity and wants in to the premature bonging of the hour to the false confines of the walls of our houses there is always a damnable flaw in the system    and incoming elves who taunt “excuses excuses”   xxviii  what is it about this flame i label passion that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp how can i call myself hungry for the facts of one kind but wince at another the lover’s room may be an allwhite tiny room with a view of woods but why if a wellmeaning friend slides a special report under my door do i look for tongs and a furnace  because the flame is not only selfinfatuated given to burning documents for the sake of flaunting its own reds but also in a state of permanent warfare all worldly flareups all currencies not its own remind it that amid the worst incendiary horrors it goes on stoking itself for want of a proper spark   xxix  the catechism of the far gone isn’t it too good to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that billboard with the same unqualified disgust can we ignore the fact that you happened to witness the accident only minutes after i did is there more than just a flimsy link in a story jointly loved a pastime avoided  no yes and by no means these are the very traits which observed in an enemy get shelved or denied by their once proud possessor i could pillage an igloo travel to the torrid antipodes and produce thousands like you featured like you like you in raves and complaints i was bedazzled by a ray of fool’s gold   xxx  go tyrant in your heart will nest no more desperate slaves come again days of productivity nights of rest and no nightmares i have spent so much time under the shade of your massive umbrella that i will draw it shut for a minute to see what i once saw and what i have missed since seeing you eyes look unchained around you  it is a landscape of moldering stones and bones when the eyes are free to roam they are not so much free as uselessi see a sky of fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them peer into the living record of a severed oak and can decipher nothing return dark glasses come again morbid parasol only in shade do mountains have features   xxxi  in the final tally of divine overseers who will be ours suppose we claim the moon whose bottomless bag of stardust enchants a forest of two softens and shrinks the volume of venomous air between us and lovingly coats all former fears with beams of forgetful nourishing light  our watcher is the moon but only after a brutal shakeup is through with her she has never learned the knack of lighting two people at once instead it is always me illumined you off in the bushes you posed in your halo me waistdeep in darkness and she is a clumsy goddess for the reason that she borrows poor moon what light she has from me   xxxii  though you are by definition a slippery freedom if forced to freeze you in a single image i would call you a beam of light with hidden powers to strike and alter forever here is a room regard its monotone grimness enter your incandescent highness gladly around you objects sparkle knowing a beam when they see it  next to your flawless arc i am a damaged bulb in a fleabag hotel clattering on to reveal paintings on velvet and objets trouvésbut where rattling off to plunge the rundown room into dark desuetude what if we pooled our forces would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro   xxxiii  perfect you say it is enough to make me perform operations on myself in order to test your love taking in the wreckage you would be forced to say “yes gouging out one eye makes the other shine all the brighter the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer your leprous stump is a modish charmer since after all green is my favorite color”  and yet for all our tirades against deception how easily do we succumb to the lover’s flattery and with what treachery if i am perfect it is only by being perfect that you myopic dependable you can keep me so go on keep on calling me faultless come on hurry up with my supper leave me and come back at midnight but don’t come back if you hear a noise in the room   xxxiv   still the inveterate skulker the ghost of chaos past i have come back to the place where it all began where leaving you gave me leave to see you wherever i went in the home in the wild in the sky in the gutter and where columns scribbled on and abandoned took one look at my raving and rose again  strangest of all is that given the chance to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last i would flatly refuse these barren days when i heat my room by the fading coals of my goals this ache for an ache is as good as it gets so go on running i will go on looking for you as the willow bends as the stomach hunts for the ulcer

 0 the first line “blackface is sometimes the truth” the poet knows this will make fire  ponders performing in some dark room squinting at the black type red gel spots like laser sights from a rifle big as a bus  but here the sniper stirs herbal tea has a cell phone the number of a woman the color of thrush wings  for now the sniper with the cell phone will be he  he misses the next line beneath the spoon clanging in the mug like the clapper in a schooner’s alarm bell the third line  perhaps “   the smoldering cork testifies   ” or “   the moldy corpse terrifies   ” he considers each and wonders about the second line  then about the girl he saw boarding the bus what her name sounds like whispered in a dim room  of red candles a radio where the poet is “ncing and bucking and the yes and suh   ”he misses something else  the new line of little to do with corks or corpsescourts maybe and what’s “   un a gold coin promise layaway heaven with teeth and silence   ”  he is lost between a poem a cell and a thrush’s wing  so by this time the poet should probably place a refrain as this is going to be a long poem long enough to make the poet famous   1 blackface is sometimes the truth but with added emphasis a boldface where the smoldering cork testifies  the issue is intent nahmean like what is nahmean whenyousee knows its way around the alleys of the tongue what is nahmean nahmean and the intent is the issue you see nahmean  blackface is sometimes a lie but with added detail a bold face where the smoldering cork testifies   2 but to what the sawdust packed pockets the brogan’s salty shadow to the straps scraps off the hips of tin platters  the train’s constant is acomin the minister’s constant that someday what is the cork still smelling of cheap wine some doe  eyed muscatel a poor man’s dreamcolor of velvet some sap fresh from a cicada tableau to a night club in a sunday suit  cardboard under his left sock the bootblack ache slithering out above his ass the bootblack cash kissed in waxy fingerprints  offered up offered up to the waitress who won’t smile for a “what this get” the bottle brought back armpit warm this cork tossed to the floor  and kicked a careless jig swung by a white chick and rolled below a table awaiting some jittering negro whose gig it is to eyeball  these corks to swoop down hands a pair of crows to swoop up the cork bear it backstage to pull it from his pocket like a magician’s dove  transform it into smoke and ovation  what does this testify  what is this truth  why speak of the fire the first kiss of flame to the cork  watch bamboozled that’s all i did  what does this testify   3 what is truth again reading some magazine  again waiting for the dressing room door to open  fire gleaming off the platter like a breakfast of stars burning cork  from portugal and cork doesn’t sink in rough waters like fine schooners  from portugal and fire splits the blackness of dark like the fingers of sailors  from portugal

 the pleasure of contrast not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater holding his breath but composing himself  for the camera in his only suit you have to understand photography unforgiving mirror unlike oils that soften  the hard edges of a man’s face if you want them to or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape  the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter that’s not at all how it’s done the camera’s lens blanketed by cloth  to keep it in the dark any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow his eyes already turn inward to that place we’re going  she thinks about escape too at the horse butcher in line like the others or arguing over the price of bread  at the market of innocents adam’s rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer’s fist  but she at least is smiling when he says we have such a small family meaning your body  won’t open to meit’s shackled inside its cage love and rage whose bars are meant to be broken

 it was a good day and i was about to do something important and good but then i unscrewed the pen i was using to see the ink precision german craftsmanship the germans are so persnickety and precise they wash their driveways their mountains and streams dance around each other in a clockwork courtly imitation of spring they build the panzer tank out of rakes hoses and garden gnomes they built me and i’ve seated myself above an avenue on the brink of mystery always just on the lip with my toes over the lip but my bowels behind  when i replaced the ink the sky was socked in only one window of blue open in the north directly over someone but that person was reading about rosicrucians in the laundromat he was unaware as the blue window closed above him the rest of us are limp and damp i see a button in front of us that says “spin cycle” i’m going to push it

 on the warm sunday afternoons and every evening in the spring and summer when the night hurries the late homecorner and the air grows softer and scraps of tunes float from the open windows and jar against the voices of children and the hum of a car when the city noises commingle and melt with a restless something halfseen halffelt i see them always there upon the low smooth wall before the church that row of little girls who sit and stare like sparrows on a granite perch they come in twittering couples or walk alone to their gray bough of stone sometimes by twos and threes sometimes as many as five but always they sit there on the narrow coping brighteyed and solemn scarcely hoping to see more than what is merely moving and alive   they hear the couples pass the lisp of happy feet increases and the night grows suddenly sweet   before the quiet church that smells of death they sit and life sweeps past them with a rushing breath and reaches out and plucks them by the hand and calls them boldly whispering to each in some strange speech they tremble to but cannot understand it thrills and troubles them as one by one the days run off like water through a sieve while with a gaze as candid as the sun poignant and puzzled and inquisitive they come and sit a part of life and yet apart from it

 high in the breathless hall the minstrel sate and emonts murmur mingled with the song the words of ancient time i thus translate a festal strain that hath been silent long  from town to town from tower to tower the red rose is a gladsome flower her thirty years of winter past the red rose is revived at last she lifts her head for endless spring for everlasting blossoming both roses flourish red and white in love and sisterly delight the two that were at strife are blended and all old troubles now are ended joy joy to both but most to her who is the flower of lancaster behold her how she smiles today on this great throng this bright array fair greeting doth she send to all from every corner of the hall but chiefly from above the board where sits in state our rightful lord a clifford to his own restored  they came with banner spear and shield and it was proved in bosworthfield not long the avenger was withstood earth helped him with the cry of blood st george was for us and the might of blessed angels crowned the right loud voice the land has uttered forth we loudest in the faithful north our fields rejoice our mountains ring our streams proclaim a welcoming our strongabodes and castles see the glory of their loyalty  how glad is skipton at this hour though lonely a deserted tower knight squire and yeoman page and groom we have them at the feast of broughm how glad pendragonthough the sleep of years be on hershe shall reap a taste of this great pleasure viewing as in a dream her own renewing rejoiced is brough right glad i deem beside her little humble stream and she that keepeth watch and ward her statelier edens course to guard they both are happy at this hour though each is but a lonely tower but here is perfect joy and pride for one fair house by emonts side this day distinguished without peer to see her master and to cheer him and his ladymother dear  oh it was a time forlorn when the fatherless was born give her wings that she may fly or she sees her infant die swords that are with slaughter wild hunt the mother and the child who will take them from the light yonder is a man in sight yonder is a housebut where no they must not enter there to the caves and to the brooks to the clouds of heaven she looks she is speechless but her eyes pray in ghostly agonies blissful mary mother mild maid and mother undefiled save a mother and her child  now who is he that bounds with joy on carrocks side a shepherdboy no thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass light as the wind along the grass can this be he who hither came in secret like a smothered flame oer whom such thankful tears were shed for shelter and a poor mans bread god loves the child and god hath willed that those dear words should be fulfilled the ladys words when forced away the last she to her babe did say my own my own thy fellowguest i may not be but rest thee rest for lowly shepherds life is best  alas when evil men are strong no life is good no pleasure long the boy must part from mosedales groves and leave blencatharas rugged coves and quit the flowers that summer brings to glenderamakins lofty springs must vanish and his careless cheer be turned to heaviness and fear give sir lancelot threlkeld praise hear it good man old in days thou tree of covert and of rest for this young bird that is distrest among thy branches safe he lay and he was free to sport and play when falcons were abroad for prey  a recreant harp that sings of fear and heaviness in cliffords ear i said when evil men are strong no life is good no pleasure long a weak and cowardly untruth our clifford was a happy youth and thankful through a weary time that brought him up to manhoods prime again he wanders forth at will and tends a flock from hill to hill his garb is humble neer was seen such garb with such a noble mien among the shepherdgrooms no mate hath he a child of strength and state yet lacks not friends for simple glee nor yet for higher sympathy  to his side the fallowdeer came and rested without fear the eagle lord of land and sea stooped down to pay him fealty and both the undying fish that swim through bowscaletarn did wait on him the pair were servants of his eye in their immortality and glancing gleaming dark or bright moved to and fro for his delight he knew the rocks which angels haunt upon the mountains visitant he hath kenned them taking wing and into caves where faeries sing he hath entered and been told by voices how men lived of old among the heavens his eye can see the face of thing that is to be and if that men report him right his tongue could whisper words of might now another day is come fitter hope and nobler doom he hath thrown aside his crook and hath buried deep his book armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield tell thy name thou trembling field field of death whereer thou be groan thou with our victory happy day and mighty hour when our shepherd in his power mailed and horsed with lance and sword to his ancestors restored like a reappearing star like a glory from afar first shall head the flock of war  alas the impassioned minstrel did not know how by heavens grace this cliffords heart was framed how he long forced in humble walks to go was softened into feeling soothed and tamed  love had he found in huts where poor men lie his daily teachers had been woods and rills the silence that is in the starry sky the sleep that is among the lonely hills  in him the savage virtue of the race revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead nor did he change but kept in lofty place the wisdom which adversity had bred  glad were the vales and every cottagehearth the shepherdlord was honoured more and more and ages after he was laid in earth the good lord clifford was the name he bore

 halted against the shade of a last hill they fed and lying easy were at ease and finding comfortable chests and knees carelessly slept but many there stood still to face the stark blank sky beyond the ridge knowing their feet had come to the end of the world marvelling they stood and watched the long grass swirled by the may breeze murmurous with wasp and midge for though the summer oozed into their veins like the injected drug for their bones’ pains sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass fearfully flashed the sky’s mysterious glass  hour after hour they ponder the warm field and the far valley behind where the buttercups had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up where even the little brambles would not yield but clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands they breathe like trees unstirred till like a cold gust thrilled the little word at which each body and its soul begird and tighten them for battle no alarms of bugles no high flags no clamorous haste only a lift and flare of eyes that faced the sun like a friend with whom their love is done o larger shone that smile against the sun mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned  so soon they topped the hill and raced together over an open stretch of herb and heather exposed and instantly the whole sky burned with fury against them and soft sudden cups opened in thousands for their blood and the green slopes chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space  of them who running on that last high place leapt to swift unseen bullets or went up on the hot blast and fury of hell’s upsurge or plunged and fell away past this world’s verge some say god caught them even before they fell but what say such as from existence’ brink ventured but drave too swift to sink the few who rushed in the body to enter hell and there outfiending all its fiends and flames with superhuman inhumanities longfamous glories immemorial shames and crawling slowly back have by degrees regained cool peaceful air in wonder why speak they not of comrades that went under

 the magnolia before it blooms stands  bare as a statue from antiquity or  a shaved puss it flowers first  then greens a pissed off dyke  climbs into the branches  to be held by an ancient  indifference and both  were me yet it’s possible i am  a short bald man that i am neither  a bigbosomed widehipped pretty  nor a short bald man an antelope an elk a deer  on this rug a twiggy tree  the genderless squat figure  solo blurry hands on hips that repeats  a plush life of winter and  summer colors of flowers alongside  tight checkered bands  edging the broad green center  where we look for each other  a woods a pasture a park a yard a median of grass  set in a concrete mold situated  within a pay lot how it feels to stand  outside a house at night whose lights are on  whose lights are on

 excerpt hark ’tis the twanging horn o’er yonder bridge that with its wearisome but needful length bestrides the wintry flood in which the moon sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright he comes the herald of a noisy world with spatter’d boots strapp’d waist and frozen locks news from all nations lumb’ring at his back true to his charge the closepack’d load behind yet careless what he brings his one concern is to conduct it to the destin’d inn and having dropp’d th’ expected bagpass on he whistles as he goes lighthearted wretch cold and yet cheerful messenger of grief perhaps to thousands and of joy to some to him indiff’rent whether grief or joy houses in ashes and the fall of stocks births deaths and marriages epistles wet with tears that trickled down the writer’s cheeks fast as the periods from his fluent quill or charg’d with am’rous sighs of absent swains or nymphs responsive equally affect his horse and him unconscious of them all but oh th’ important budget usher’d in with such heartshaking music who can say what are its tidings have our troops awak’d or do they still as if with opium drugg’d snore to the murmurs of th’ atlantic wave is india free and does she wear her plum’d and jewell’d turban with a smile of peace or do we grind her still the grand debate the popular harangue the tart reply the logic and the wisdom and the wit and the loud laughi long to know them all i burn to set th’ imprison’d wranglers free and give them voice and utt’rance once again  now stir the fire and close the shutters fast let fall the curtains wheel the sofa round and while the bubbling and loudhissing urn throws up a steamy column and the cups that cheer but not inebriate wait on each so let us welcome peaceful ev’ning in not such his ev’ning who with shining face sweats in the crowded theatre and squeez’d and bor’d with elbowpoints through both his sides outscolds the ranting actor on the stage nor his who patient stands till his feet throb and his head thumps to feed upon the breath of patriots bursting with heroic rage or placemen all tranquility and smiles this folio of four pages happy work which not ev’n critics criticise that holds inquisitive attention while i read fast bound in chains of silence which the fair though eloquent themselves yet fear to break what is it but a map of busy life its fluctuations and its vast concerns      oh winter ruler of th’ inverted year thy scatter’d hair with sleet like ashes fill’d thy breath congeal’d upon thy lips thy cheeks fring’d with a beard made white with other snows than those of age thy forehead wrapt in clouds a leafless branch thy sceptre and thy throne a sliding car indebted to no wheels but urg’d by storms along its slipp’ry way i love thee all unlovely as thou seem’st and dreaded as thou art  thou hold’st the sun a pris’ner in the yet undawning east short’ning his journey between morn and noon and hurrying him impatient of his stay down to the rosy west but kindly still compensating his loss with added hours of social converse and instructive ease and gathering at short notice in one group the family dispers’d and fixing thought not less dispers’d by daylight and its cares i crown thee king of intimate delights fireside enjoyments homeborn happiness and all the comforts that the lowly roof of undisturb’d retirement and the hours of long uninterrupted evening know no ratt’ling wheels stop short before these gates no powder’d pert proficient in the art of sounding an alarm assaults these doors till the street rings no stationary steeds cough their own knell while heedless of the sound the silent circle fan themselves and quake but here the needle plies its busy task the pattern grows the welldepicted flow’r wrought patiently into the snowy lawn unfolds its bosom buds and leaves and sprigs and curling tendrils gracefully dispos’d follow the nimble finger of the fair a wreath that cannot fade or flow’rs that blow with most success when all besides decay the poet’s or historian’s page by one made vocal for th’ amusement of the rest the sprightly lyre whose treasure of sweet sounds the touch from many a trembling chord shakes out and the clear voice symphonious yet distinct and in the charming strife triumphant still beguile the night and set a keener edge on female industry the threaded steel flies swiftly and unfelt the task proceeds the volume clos’d the customary rites of the last meal commence  a roman meal such as the mistress of the world once found delicious when her patriots of high note perhaps by moonlight at their humble doors and under an old oak’s domestic shade enjoy’d spare feast a radish and an egg discourse ensues not trivial yet not dull nor such as with a frown forbids the play of fancy or proscribes the sound of mirth nor do we madly like an impious world who deem religion frenzy and the god that made them an intruder on their joys start at his awful name or deem his praise a jarring note  themes of a graver tone exciting oft our gratitude and love while we retrace with mem’ry’s pointing wand that calls the past to our exact review the dangers we have ’scap’d the broken snare the disappointed foe deliv’rance found unlook’d for life preserv’d and peace restor’d fruits of omnipotent eternal love oh ev’nings worthy of the gods exclaim’d the sabine bard  oh ev’nings i reply more to be priz’d and coveted than yours as more illumin’d and with nobler truths that i and mine and those we love enjoy

 at a college in dearborn michigan i read a poem about watching girls at camp hold their breaths under the showers so i could see their breasts swell some people call dearborn a hub of “terrorist” activity i’ve placed the word terrorist between quotation marks because “arab” or “muslim” or “people who look like the terrorists we fear” is what they mean in the poem about the camp i also use quotation marks around the words “pussy” and “chickenshit” but for different reasons  i’m waiting in line to jump over a dam into a river where other boys have drowned and i hesitate until someone shouts “pussy” and “chickenshit” and you don’t need me to tell you what i did what i had to do a famous poet says for a speaker to express authority he must possess three virtues one of which is passion after the reading a young man approached me he turned out to be the younger brother of someone i knew and wrote a poem about a lifeguard who saved a drowning girl the child pulled from the pool could have been a boy  i don’t remember it doesn’t matter i care about what i’m saying  that matters passion is a deepseated conviction says the famous poet you need to believe that i believe i told the young man in dearborn about his brother saving a life as if he didn’t already know he listened politely until i stopped talking and then he said i was out of line and had acted inappropriately how i asked he said i shouldn’t use words like that which words i asked he was getting flustered i asked him again i wanted him to say “pussy” and “chickenshit” he said i should not use words like that in front of women by “women” he meant arab and muslim women maybe he meant all women i don’t know i didn’t ask a lot of arabs and muslims live in dearborn that’s why some people think of it as a hotbed of islamic terrorism the phrase “a hotbed of islamic terrorism” should probably appear between quotes every time people use it even if they are arab or muslim like me the other virtues a speaker should possess says the famous poet are discrimination and inclusiveness by “discrimination” he means the speaker should come to his position without ignoring but considering opposed positions and finding them wanting by “inclusiveness” he means the speaker immediately sees connections between the subject at hand and other issues also the speaker needs to make the reader believe he is doing his subject justice that he is relating it to the world this makes his voice communal speaking not for any community but with the goal of making communities the first of which is that of speaker and reader the young man speaking on behalf of arab and muslim women told me that my poems were “indecent” and “immoral” that i should be ashamed that i was a terrible muslim “go fuck yourself” is what i wanted to say but  maybe he was right  so i smiled i thanked him for listening and i told him i loved his brother and “please will you say i said hello”

 i knew a man he was my chum but he grew blacker every day and would not brush the flies away nor blanch however fierce the hum of passing shells i used to read to rouse him random things from donne like “get with child a mandrakeroot” but you can tell he was far gone for he lay gaping mackereleyed and stiff and senseless as a post even when that old poet cried “i long to talk with some old lover’s ghost”  i tried the elegies one day but he because he heard me say “what needst thou have no more covering than a man” grinned nastily and so i knew the worms had got his brains at last there was one thing that i might do to starve the worms i racked my head for healthy things and quoted maud his grin got worse and i could see he sneered at passion’s purity he stank so badly though we were great chums i had to leave him then rats ate his thumbs

 out of heaven to bless the high places it falls on the penthouses drizzling at first then a pelting allegro and dick and jane skip to the terrace and go boogieing through the azaleas while mommy and daddy come running with pots and pans glasses and basins and try to hold all of it up there but no use it’s too much it keeps coming and pours off the edges down limestone to the pitchers and pails on the ground where delirious residents catch it and bucket brigades get it moving inside until bathtubs are brimful but still it keeps coming that shower of silver in alleys and gutters all pouring downhill to the sleazy red brick and the barefoot people who romp in it laughing but never take thought for tomorrow all spinning in a pleasure they catch for a moment so when providence turns off the spigot and the sky goes as dry as a prairie then daddy looks down from the penthouse down to the streets to the gutters and his heart goes out to his neighbors to the little folk thirsty for laughter and he prays in his boundless compassion on behalf of the world and its people he demands of his godgive me more

 sometimes it feels like it is over and its not sometimes it feels like it has just begun and its over   its dark often at these times urban though so a certain version of light too its hard to predict if it will start on time or how late im often a little late and it has started last night i could tell from the copters overhead that i was late as i walked up the blocks around it were emptying out parents pulled their children home the night herons settled into trees thats the outer ring as i got closer all that was left were the blinking lights of the motor cycles blocking the intersections and the men and few women in uniforms that mill about the corner helmets in their hands they talked among themselves ignored me mainly one told me how to get around i did not clarify that i was walking towards you can hear it sometimes it often has a soundtrack sometimes it has drums and brass sometimes just joy when i am late i am trying to guess its path last night several times i got close to it only to be turned back by a line of cops   they let the media through but turned me back then it turned the corner and there it was at that moment i melted my body into it and it embraced me rosy fingered dusk and all that come here it sang listen and then i was borne along by the waves all night and the whirlpool the fig tree and i was the bat hanging on patiently aarav came up and hugged me someone grabbed me from behind and i thought it is artem but later realized it was berat so much mask i grabbed charlottes hand and held it for a while when things felt dicey it felt dicey as they cornered us from two sides and we went down the tight side street up the hill charlottes hand its like that moving from isolation to the depths of friends   at first we didnt mask up we were poets then slowly one by one we did as we got turnt as i got turnt i mean sometimes i still dont mask up it often feels hubristic i keep a bandana in my pocket it isnt super effective it falls down a lot last night i tied it around my neck as we walked up the side street hill i pulled it over my face as i walked past the line of cops i noticed emma there throwing eggs i ducked two balloons filled with paint flew by visors suddenly yellow   she said to me how is your heart and i at first worried her question then i realized she meant my heart and how it was turnt it is good i said i am opening it i am expanding it and i meant it i love you i texted felix lub u i texted haruto texting isabella and jackson i love you guys i miss you i texted love you some fortythree times in the last

too but she didnt she said she wanted to see what happens then she texts i love you and i know then that trader joes has been looted all the wines out in the street such sweet elixir fomo then the rest of that night we quickly say goodbyes after the reading refuse the offer of going to drinks careen from the reading to our home one of us on twit ter the entire time texting too while we are driving one of us at home runs out into the streets towards the gas i drive up and two of us get out of the car and i stay in the car and drive the few blocks home my son has fallen asleep in the back i am coughing in the car from the gas he sleeps through it i take him out and carry him up to bed more texts i love you i text come by and get me when you are done   later that night i go out again miguel stays home with minjoon i go to a fight party marxist v nihilist no one knows which is which mohamed my fighting teacher fights i miss it i love you i text she texts back im high on being slugged my eyes are swollen i lost im turnt standing outside a woman gets kicked out of the club the bouncer tosses her out and into us she is fucked up and this feels awful to her her arms wildly swinging indicate this awful feeling it feels awful to us another woman tries to help her and she slugs her she misses and the woman who she has tried to slug takes her calms her down i hear her saying i love you i love you over and over later i will learn that she spent the entire night talking the woman down its like that when turnt sometimes one needs to be held still later i stand on the street outside my house and watch the tmobile get looted a man tries to stop another man who has his hammer at the ready in front of the window the man who is attempting to stop the hammer gets hit in the face with the butt of the hammer i decide to go to bed it is 3 am i text nathan and say i love you and ill leave the key in the box for you the march continues on nathan continues on turns left a block away and then when nathan texts me back i know the whole foods is looted and they are all drinking champagne dancing all of them will get a cold later riot champagne becomes a term among us that winter i wasnt there but i was there too my germs were there i too had that cold   is this poem too heroic i am sorry i worry it is or i know it is we are turnt to mere vandals at moments ill admit it

i love you and we walked down the street as each window was cracked they got turnt eventually we disperse i jog for a few minutes away and out of the kettle we joke circle back to watch a car burn oliver walks by he is hurrying towards the dispersal i love you we say to him as he heads off the car burns the fire truck arrives as i stand there watching it it is as if everyone i ever texted i

 we wear the mask that grins and lies it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes this debt we pay to human guile with torn and bleeding hearts we smile and mouth with myriad subtleties  why should the world be overwise in counting all our tears and sighs nay let them only see us while we wear the mask  we smile but o great christ our cries to thee from tortured souls arise we sing but oh the clay is vile beneath our feet and long the mile but let the world dream otherwise we wear the mask

 that time my grandmother dragged me through the perfume aisles at saks she held me up by my arm hissing “stand up” through clenched teeth her eyes bright as a dog’s cornered in the light she said it over and over as if she were jesus and i were dead she had been solid as a tree a fur around her neck a lightskinned matron whose car was parked who walked on swirling marble and passed through brass openingsin 1945 there was not even a black elevator operator at saks the saleswoman had brought velvet leggings to lace me in and cooed as if in the service of all grandmothers my grandmother had smiled but not hungrily not like my mother who hated them but wanted to please and they had smiled back as if they were wearing wooden collars when my legs gave out my grandmother dragged me up and held me like god holds saints by the roots of the hair i begged her to believe i couldn’t help it stumbling her face white with sweat she pushed me through the crowd rushing away from those eyes that saw through her clothes under her skin all the way down to the transparent genes confessing

 a guy comes walking out of the garden playing dark eyes on the accordian we’re sitting on the porch drinking and spitting lying we shut our eyes snap our fingers dewhurst goes out to his truck like he doesn’t believe what he’s seeing and brings back threehalfpints a little whirlwind occurs in the road carrying dust away like a pail of water we’re drinking serious now and oz wants to break in the store for some head cheese but the others won’t let him everybody laughs dances the crossroads are all quiet except for the little man on the accordian things are dying down the moon spills its water dewhurst says he smells rain oz says if it rains he’ll still make a crop we wait there all night looking for rain we haven’t been to sleep so the blue lizards on the side of the white porch lose their tails when we try to dream the man playing the music looks at us noticing what we’re up to he backs off holding up his hands in front smiling shaking his head but before he gets half way down the road that oz shoots him in the belly all summer his accordian rotted in the ditch like an armadillo turning into a house payment

 what is the sound of sounds  sounding indefinite fist in face again and  sound of the surprise of it coming  from nowhere of breaking the arm  on a small fall in your own house  a respiratory failure wound opening like a little mouth  we inhabit the brutal we are shattered everyday  we look askew head broken floor array light  array great distances life goals  staked upon every border  guardians protections have many faces  misuse of the face as a streaming  desire solution posted “get rid of all the niggers”   the state exacts its controls  that the pepper spray happens against kneeling children  that the search for the secret leaker is unyielding  if you want you can make a myopic focus concentrate  on a shone shadow or drift off into space

 what land have you cast from the blottedout region of your face  what nation stung by watermarks was filmed out of extinction and brought forth resembling frost  what offspring must jump through the eye of birth to be winked at when covered with brick sweat  what ache piled its planks on the corner pier now crumbles onto motionless water sniffed at by forest smoke  what makes this song a string of beads seized by cement cracks when the camera climbs through the basement windowwinter clouds coiling through its speckled lens  what season cannot locate an eye in the dark of the sound of the sun gyrating into red ocher after i thought you noticed my language was half wren half pigeon and together we spoke a wing pattern on the wall that was raised to keep “us” out there where “calling” became “culling” “distance” distanced in a mere scrape of enamel on yellow teeth  what father woke turned over his wife she didn’t want to but he pushed until the baby leapt through now now now strummed into a chorus of burn marks on ceilings where police sirens fruit magpie skulls on trees of monsoon lightning  what what whatis how that song chimed in wilderness

 1 but i was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer exhausted you lay your head on the kitchen table and said “but what’s the difference between a monster and a cyborg i need something to eat do you have any chocolate” opening the fridge i said quietly and perhaps too seriously trying to impress you “the monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances” her fate her body great britain you said “so is laloo english or british” i said “she’s from london” but the more i said london the more it sounded like a joke londonlondonlondon  2 i was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car this is something you can only do here wish for something did you ever do it wish you weren’t there i want that go on go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the panama canal or idaho hitchhiking in idaho as a veritable child i was taken in by a farming couple fatty and daddy a hundred miles or so outside of boise fatty was rail thin about seventyfive and daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife they picked me up in their trucki was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingersand i stayed with them for five days they said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called country buffet in my innocence i had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a kkk leaderoperative charles reynold what is an operative it is someone who is always planning a way in like the henhouse fox with his beautifully red bushy tail daddy fatty and i hunkered down until daddy’s nephew robert stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to boise proper where there was a bus station i waited until robert had gone and then i walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers “i can take you as far as the state line” “that would be lovely” obsessed far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at heathrow airport or nestle the main employers in the dingy part of northwest london that constituted my origins i said yes soft yes to the color green which is going  3 that is a tree going but also an ocean a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me for you it might happen in another place mine like laloo i lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows thus a juniper tree flying by the window intensely blue or the atlantic ocean to the left if the car has a destination to the south such as to the keys is magical to me improbable in light of my origins hers the girl in the car i don’t know i am writing to you in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it the dress the morning of writing ahead of you is a café as if writing you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself for this reason when i think of you reading i think of you as writing blindly you read but you are also writing as if my own eyes were closed i see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl these books are separate from my own work here in the saltwater notebook but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense like birds  4 this is pre but the notebook is after soaked already at the edge and foamy past future writing on the warp when dry pages entries by hand that is the morning i woke up and walked to the pacific ocean after a night in a motel in florence oregon complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows the woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it an expatriate she said exaggeratedly oblivious to our common origin “about four miles you’re not going to walk are you do you have an umbrella you can’t go out like that ducky”  5 i walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up on its forested proximal verge by gorse which is a bright yellow flower citronyellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it the day like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain monsoon what kind of rain is this i recognized the immensity but not the temperature this was monstrous the inability to assimilate on the level of the senses an ordinary experience of weather here is the tongue for example constantly darting out to feel the air what is it is it summer is it a different season it’s a different day that’s okay damaged from her travels in some sense unsettled enormously anxious a girl does it anway gets up and goes it’s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around

 to be poor and raise skinny children to own nothing but skinny clothing skinny food falls in between cracks friends cannot visit your skinny home they cannot fit through the door your skinny thoughts evaporate into the day or the night that you cannot see with your tiny eyes  god sticks you with the smallest pins and your blood the red is diluted imagine a tiny hole the other side of which is a fat world and how lost you would feel of course i’m speaking to myself how lost i would feel and how dangerous

 not fierce and tender but sweet this is our impression of the soldiers we call our machine aunt pauline fasten it fat that is us we say aunt pauline when we left paris we had rain not snow now nor that in between we did have snow then now we are bold we are accustomed to it all the weights are measures by this we mean we know how much oil we use for the machine                        hurrah for america here we met a captain and take him part way a days sun is this miss yes indeed our mat we meant by this that we were always meeting people and that it was pleasant we can thank you we thank you soldiers of course spoke to us come together come to me there now they read on our van american committee in aid of french wounded all of it is bit bitter this is the way they say we do help in the meaning of bright bright not light this comforts them when they speak to me i often discuss america with them and what we hope to do they listen well and say we hope so too we all do                        this is apropros of the birthplace of maréchal joffre we visited it and we have sent postal cards of it the committee will be pleased it is not a bother to be a soldier i think kindly of that bother can you say lapse then think about it indeed it is yet we are so pleased with the flag with the flag of sets sets of color do you like flags blue flags smell sweetly blue flags in a whirl we did this we had ribbon of the american flag and we cut it up and we gave each soldier one with a pin and they pinned it on and we were pleased and we received a charming letter from a telephonist at the front who heard from a friend in perpignan that we were giving this bit of ribbon and he asked for some and we sent them and we hope that they are all living the wind blows and the automobile goes can you guess boards wood naturally we think about wind because this country of rousillon is the windiest corner in france also it is a great wine country                        this is apropos of the fact that i always ask where they come from and then i am ashamed to say i dont know all the departments but i am learning them in the meantime in the meantime we are useful that is what i mean to say in the meantime can you have beds this means that knowing the number of beds you begin to know the hospital kindly call a brother what is a cure i speak french what one means i can call it in time by the way where are fish they all love fishing in that case are there any wonders many wonders are women i could almost say that that was apropos of my cranking my machine and men too we smile in the way sentences he does not feel as we do but he did have the coat he blushed a little this is sometimes when they cant quite help themselves and they want to help us we do not understand the weather that astonishes me camellias in perpignan camellias finish when roses begin thank you in smiles in this way we go on so far we have had no troubles yet and yet we do need material it is astonishing that those who have fought so hard and so well should pick yellow irises and fish in a stream and then a pansy i did not ask for it it smells a sweet smell with acacia call it locusts call it me i finish by saying that the french soldier is the person we should all help

 1  an old man bending i come among new faces years looking backward resuming in answer to children come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me arous’d and angry i’d thought to beat the alarum and urge relentless war but soon my fingers fail’d me my face droop’d and i resign’d myself to sit by the wounded and soothe them or silently watch the dead years hence of these scenes of these furious passions these chances of unsurpass’d heroes was one side so brave the other was equally brave now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics of hardfought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains   2  o maidens and young men i love and that love me what you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls soldier alert i arrive after a long march cover’d with sweat and dust in the nick of time i come plunge in the fight loudly shout in the rush of successful charge enter the captur’d worksyet lo like a swift running river they fade pass and are gone they fadei dwell not on soldiers’ perils or soldiers’ joys both i remember wellmany of the hardships few the joys yet i was content  but in silence in dreams’ projections while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on so soon what is over forgotten and waves wash the imprints off the sand with hinged knees returning i enter the doors while for you up there whoever you are follow without noise and be of strong heart  bearing the bandages water and sponge straight and swift to my wounded i go where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground or to the rows of the hospital tent or under the roof’d hospital to the long rows of cots up and down each side i return to each and all one after another i draw near not one do i miss an attendant follows holding a tray he carries a refuse pail soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood emptied and fill’d again  i onward go i stop with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that would save you   3  on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors the crush’d head i dress poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away the neck of the cavalryman with the bullet through and through i examine hard the breathing rattles quite glazed already the eye yet life struggles hard come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death in mercy come quickly  from the stump of the arm the amputated hand i undo the clotted lint remove the slough wash off the matter and blood back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv’d neck and side falling head his eyes are closed his face is pale he dares not look on the bloody stump and has not yet look’d on it  i dress a wound in the side deep deep but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking and the yellowblue countenance see  i dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bulletwound cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene so sickening so offensive while the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail  i am faithful i do not give out the fractur’d thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen these and more i dress with impassive hand yet deep in my breast a fire a burning flame   4  thus in silence in dreams’ projections returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips

 oh fortune thy wresting wavering state hath fraught with cares my troubled wit whose witness this present prison late could bear where once was joy’s loan quit thou causedst the guilty to be loosed from bands where innocents were inclosed and caused the guiltless to be reserved and freed those that death had well deserved but all herein can be nothing wrought so god send to my foes all they have thought

 he sits at the table cloudlight of march one tone with his hair graysilver on silver midday fare in vermont is basic enough in west newbury eggs and toast will do though our doctor’s had his sips of wine as well “just don’t be fooled they’re not as nice as you think they are live here a few more winters you’ll get to know them clearer and viceversa” three years now and we’re still finding our way newcomers need a guide to show them the ropes and he has been explaining township and county almost from the sunstruck day we met him that very first july in this old house “i’ll cite an instance of community spirit at work north country justice a case i just happened to be involved in no pleaseall right if you are having one” he holds his glass aloft and then lets fall a silence that has grown familiar to us from other stories told on other days the will to recount building its head of steam “well now you have to know about the victim his name was charlie deudon no doubt canuck stock some generations back but he nor no one else could tell youif they cared deudons had been dirt farmers here as long as anybody knew they never starved but never had a dime to spare either charlie resolved to change the deudon luck and that’s just what he did or almost did    he’d graduated two classes ahead of mine we knew each other naturally but not on terms of friendship fact is he had no friends and only one girlfriend whom he married day after commencement june of ‘32 and then he set to work and never stopped again until they made him stop for good” a wisp of a smile half irony half bereavement plays about his guileless face red cheeks blue eyes a beardless santa claus whose bag contains apart from instruments of healing stories parables and proverbs painkillers too for when all else fails “what kind of work had all that hard work been” “oh farming like his elders only better all the modern improvements fancy feed and fertilizers plus machinery he was the first in these parts to milk his herd in any way but as ‘twas done since adam’s boys first broke ground with a plow and anything machines couldn’t handle charlie did himself from dawn to midnight he never wasted a word or spilled a drop of milk or drank a drop of beer or liquor he was unnatural and he made that farm into a showplace a kind of 4h model he made good money yes but not a dollar would he spend unnecessarily do you get the picture they hated him the boys that hung around the package store the most they ever got from tightfist charlie deudon was a nod out from under his cap his trademarka baseball cap striped white and red they envied him for getting his hay in first and there was more a boy that he had hired by the name of carroll giddens was their buddy likeable fellow regulation issue the sort that knocks back a pint or a fifth in half a shake and tells offcolor stories till he’s got them choked to death with laughing ‘course the wisecracks they loved best were those about poor charlie and his goldplated farm    just one more case of what’s been often said by commentators on democracy how it helps everyone keep modest” teasing mischief has crept into his voice a selftaught anthropologist as well as teller of tales he has other frames of reference to place around events local or international he knows that things can stand for more than what they are indeed says standing for things is why we’re here and quotes chapter and verse to prove his point “think of the worldwide scapegoat ritual in halfway civilized societies an animal’s the one relieved from life duty am i right a fellow tribesman will do in a pinch if animals are lacking or if communal fears get screwed too tight    anyhow it was clear that something more than common envy stirred up the lynch law their own failure’s what they wanted dead” seconds pass in silence as he stares at somethingperhaps a knothole in the pine floorboard he looks up eyebrows raised and twirls the glass stem between stubby fingers a coil of rope hung on the wall we see has made him pause and heave experienced sighs “here have another so was charlie punished” “i’m going to tell youbetter me than others you see i was involvedno no no not in the deed lord no just as a witness it happened this wayhope you’re not squeamish charlie had this boy to help with chores the one named carroll married two kids i think not too reliable but so few are nor could you call his wages generous his buddies must have stood him drinks is all i can say he’d a skinful half the time was certainly drunk that christmas eve morning no reason to doubt what charlie told his wife charlie’d been up to help at six with the milking and carroll drunk as a fiddler’s bitch was there loading a pair of milk cans into the barrow he took a slip and the whole business spilled wooden handle clipped him in the side and he fell too right in the puddle of milk and started laughing  charlie you can guess didn’t join in he told him to get on home ‘what about the milk’ ‘go home’ he said ‘you’re drunk’ ‘but what about the milk’ asks carroll ‘comes out of next week’s paycheck’ charlie says and then the trouble starts with carroll swearing and yelping till charlie gives him a little tap and goes indoors by then carroll could tell the barrow handle had cracked a rib or two he drove into town to see his doctorthat wasn’t meand word went out that charlie had roughed up his innocent assistant that’s all they needed carroll’s friends about time that stuckup bastard got his due he’s gone too far this time but we’ll show him

 she looked nearly the same but when i hugged her there was substantially more to herno doubt as with me she fibbed as i did at the edge of curb under the streetlight as spiders dropped like tiny parachutesthey were difficult to see on the periphery of good luck i thought revisiting her quirky habits and expressions what i eventually found so bothersome except when i glanced at my watch i discovered i was trembling like a smalltime embezzler i see she said you must have an appointment the driveways and hedges funneling back into darkness into someone elses childhood where speech was an obstacle wild turkeys approaching across the lawn oh no i said im just so pleased to see you but that didnt make sense either she cocked her head a woman with grown twins and three conniving husbands even my toes felt damp i remember she said when youd lay your head on my lap id stroke your hair i didnt recall though i thought that would be a good idea now but im married i said i own my own business it would have been helpful if id planned some banter im a high school principal she told me i dont put up with horseshit from anyone i brushed the arm of her jacketshe merely stared a door slammed a grown idiot drooled in an attic somewhere down the lane i had another image as well one that held an odor of patchouli oil as she stepped forward without caution placed a hand on my neck take me she insisted to those rivets of flame following wirebecause this is it youll never have another hour i immediately felt calmer

 some day when trees have shed their leaves and against the morning’s white the shivering birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night we’ll turn our faces southward love toward the summer isle where bamboos spire the shafted grove and widemouthed orchids smile  and we will seek the quiet hill where towers the cotton tree and leaps the laughing crystal rill and works the droning bee and we will build a cottage there beside an open glade with blackribbed bluebells blowing near and ferns that never fade

 what god was it that would open earth’s picture book and see the two of us on a road snowfields glittering on every side and poplars bent like the fingers of an old man clutching what he loved about the sun  which one was it that would peer into our thatched whitewashed farmhouse and see the fur flies and shitstained walls which one laughed at the barbed wire fences the wall topped with broken glass  which of the many who came then gleaming and rimed in hard sunlight which of those who bobbed like ice along the winter shore what did we have that any god would want quick if you can find it hide it

 twice or thrice had i lovd thee before i knew thy face or name so in a voice so in a shapeless flame angels affect us oft and worshippd be still when to where thou wert i came some lovely glorious nothing i did see but since my soul whose child love is takes limbs of flesh and else could nothing do more subtle than the parent is love must not be but take a body too and therefore what thou wert and who i bid love ask and now that it assume thy body i allow and fix itself in thy lip eye and brow  whilst thus to ballast love i thought and so more steadily to have gone with wares which would sink admiration i saw i had loves pinnace overfraught evry thy hair for love to work upon is much too much some fitter must be sought for nor in nothing nor in things extreme and scattring bright can love inhere then as an angel face and wings of air not pure as it yet pure doth wear so thy love may be my loves sphere just such disparity as is twixt air and angels purity twixt womens love and mens will ever be

 all dark morning long the clouds are rising slowly up beneath us and we are fast asleep the mountains unmove  intensely and so do we meadows look down  a city there looks up and stirs a little adrift the rolling tiled roofs of buildings the deadly  trains of grinding sand and morning a spy unfolds his paper  the coffee’s served  a bride and groom stand shivering on a tarmac in the mist and they are happy each one  and all of us entangled the room is moist with us the house unfinished windowless  and we are fast asleep  the brother of the groom can’t get close enough he leans against the brightest ridge and ladder the sucking  sound of memory as heaven picks up speed and  hurtles through his burning skin its frozen blankets to the sun

 1 delirium after rimbaud  how many hours i kept that vigil by your side entire nights eyes wide as you so sweetly slept  what i was wondering why you yearned to evade the real no one has prayed harder for anything  it wasn’t for your life i feared but for mankind did you in the end find secrets for changing life    2 defaced after rilke  the head we cannot know nor its bright fruit the eyes and yet the body has its gaze a lamp turned low  or else the breast would cease to dazzle the hips fail to curve into that smile that begets more than a kiss  and flesh would lose all life not flare till there’s no blind it can’t see you behind you must change your life    3 denial after seferis  the afternoon grew hotter along our secret shore we thirsted in the glare but couldn’t drink the water  on golden sand we traced your name beside the sea the wind came like a sigh our writing was erased  how passionate our life how full of sex and song spirit and hearthow wrong and so we changed our life

 excerpt  an anatomy of the world wherein by occasion of the untimely death of mistress elizabeth drury the frailty and the decay of this whole world is represented the first anniversary when that rich soul which to her heaven is gone whom all do celebrate who know they have one for who is sure he hath a soul unless it see and judge and follow worthiness and by deeds praise it he who doth not this may lodge an inmate soul but tis not his when that queen ended here her progress time and as ther standing house to heaven did climb where loath to make the saints attend her long shes now a part both of the choir and song this world in that great earthquake languished for in a common bath of tears it bled which drew the strongest vital spirits out but succourd then with a perplexed doubt whether the world did lose or gain in this because since now no other way there is but goodness to see her whom all would see all must endeavour to be good as she this great consumption to a fever turnd and so the world had fits it joyd it mournd and as men think that agues physic are and th ague being spent give over care so thou sick world mistakst thy self to be well when alas thourt in a lethargy her death did wound and tame thee then and then thou mightst have better spard the sun or man that wound was deep but tis more misery that thou hast lost thy sense and memory twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan but this is worse that thou art speechless grown thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst thou wast nothing but she and her thou hast oerpast for as a child kept from the font until a prince expected long come to fulfill the ceremonies thou unnamd hadst laid had not her coming thee her palace made her name defind thee gave thee form and frame and thou forgetst to celebrate thy name some months she hath been dead but being dead measures of times are all determined but long sheath been away long long yet none offers to tell us who it is thats gone but as in states doubtful of future heirs when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince theyre loath it should be said the prince doth languish or the prince is dead so mankind feeling now a general thaw a strong example gone equal to law the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues now resolvd and slackd thought it some blasphemy to say shwas dead or that our weakness was discovered in that confession therefore spoke no more than tongues the soul being gone the loss deplore but though it be too late to succour thee sick world yea dead yea putrified since she thy intrinsic balm and thy preservative can never be renewd thou never live i since no man can make thee live will try what we may gain by thy anatomy her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part let no man say the world itself being dead tis labour lost to have discovered the worlds infirmities since there is none alive to study this dissection for theres a kind of world remaining still though she which did inanimate and fill the world be gone yet in this last long night her ghost doth walk that is a glimmering light a faint weak love of virtue and of good reflects from her on them which understood her worth and though she have shut in all day the twilight of her memory doth stay which from the carcass of the old world free creates a new world and new creatures be producd the matter and the stuff of this her virtue and the form our practice is and though to be thus elemented arm these creatures from homeborn intrinsic harm for all assumd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be which of themselves produce no venomous sin except some foreign serpent bring it in yet because outward storms the strongest break and strength itself by confidence grows weak this new world may be safer being told the dangers and diseases of the old for with due temper men do then forgo or covet things when they their true worth know there is no health physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well nor can be so we are born ruinous poor mothers cry that children come not right nor orderly except they headlong come and fall upon an ominous precipitation how wittys ruin how importunate upon mankind it labourd to frustrate even gods purpose and made woman sent for mans relief cause of his languishment they were to good ends and they are so still but accessory and principal in ill for that first marriage was our funeral one woman at one blow then killd us all and singly one by one they kill us now we do delightfully our selves allow to that consumption and profusely blind we kill our selves to propagate our kind and yet we do not that we are not men there is not now that mankind which was then when as the sun and man did seem to strive joint tenants of the world who should survive when stag and raven and the longlivd tree compard with man died in minority when if a slowpacd star had stoln away from the observers marking he might stay two or three hundred years to seet again and then make up his observation plain when as the age was long the size was great mans growth confessd and recompensd the meat so spacious and large that every soul did a fair kingdom and large realm control and when the very stature thus erect did that soul a good way towards heaven direct where is this mankind now who lives to age fit to be made methusalem his page alas we scarce live long enough to try whether a truemade clock run right or lie old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow and for our children we reserve tomorrow so short is life that every peasant strives in a torn house or field to have three lives and as in lasting so in length is man contracted to an inch who was a span for had a man at first in forests strayd or shipwrackd in the sea one would have laid a wager that an elephant or whale that met him would not hastily assail a thing so equall to him now alas the fairies and the pigmies well may pass as credible mankind decays so soon weare scarce our fathers shadows cast at noon only death adds tour length nor are we grown in stature to be men till we are none but this were light did our less volume hold all the old text or had we changd to gold their silver or disposd into less glass spirits of virtue which then scatterd was but tis not so ware not retird but dampd and as our bodies so our minds are crampd tis shrinking not close weaving that hath thus in mind and body both bedwarfed us we seem ambitious gods whole work tundo of nothing he made us and we strive too to bring our selves to nothing back and we do what we can to dot so soon as he with new diseases on our selves we war and with new physic a worse engine far thus man this worlds viceemperor in whom all faculties all graces are at home and if in other creatures they appear theyre but mans ministers and legates there to work on their rebellions and reduce them to civility and to mans use this man whom god did woo and loath tattend till man came up did down to man descend this man so great that all that is is his o what a trifle and poor thing he is if man were anything hes nothing now help or at least some time to waste allow this other wants yet when he did depart with her whom we lament he lost his heart she of whom thancients seemd to prophesy when they calld virtues by the name of she she in whom virtue was so much refind that for alloy unto so pure a mind she took the weaker sex she that could drive the poisonous tincture and the stain of eve out of her thoughts and deeds and purify all by a true religious alchemy she she is dead shes dead when thou knowest this thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is and learnst thus much by our anatomy the heart being perishd no part can be free and that except thou feed not banquet on the supernatural food religion thy better growth grows withered and scant be more than man or thourt less than an ant then as mankind so is the worlds whole frame quite out of joint almost created lame for before god had made up all the rest corruption entred and depravd the best it seizd the angels and then first of all the world did in her cradle take a fall and turnd her brains and took a general maim wronging each joint of thuniversal frame the noblest part man felt it first and then both beasts and plants cursd in the curse of man so did the world from the first hour decay that evening was beginning of the day and now the springs and summers which we see like sons of women after fifty be and new philosophy calls all in doubt the element of fire is quite put out the sun is lost and thearth and no mans wit can well direct him where to look for it and freely men confess that this worlds spent when in the planets and the firmament they seek so many new they see that this is crumbled out again to his atomies tis all in pieces all coherence gone all just supply and all relation prince subject father son are things forgot for every man alone thinks he hath got to be a phoenix and that then can be none of that kind of which he is but he this is the worlds condition now and now she that should all parts to reunion bow she that had all magnetic force alone to draw and fasten sundred parts in one she whom wise nature had invented then when she observd that every sort of men did in their voyage in this worlds sea stray and needed a new compass for their way she that was best and first original of all fair copies and the general steward to fate she whose rich eyes and breast gilt the west indies and perfumd the east whose having breathd in this world did bestow spice on those isles and bade them still smell so and that rich india which doth gold inter is but as single money coind from her she to whom this world must it self refer as suburbs or the microcosm of her she she is dead shes dead when thou knowst this thou knowst how lame a cripple this world is

 for marilyn who died in january april 1  found on our driveway like a feather dropped by a crow 8 of spades a playing card  we played crazy eights slapping cards or holding them as if they were birds that might fly out of our hands  decades ago in our childhood like the translucent whirling image i imagine prismatic and phosphorescent  a murmuration of starlings swooping and iridescent  but it dissolved onto a gray wall undecorated  glimpses of us wearing our velvet sunday best dresses yours usually crimson mine blue we never had nice shoes  now you have returned to water thanks to the neptune society spreading your ashes over the pacific   april 2  ceylon tea  that amber cup from sri lanka popularly known here before americans became tea drinkers as orange pekoe our mother hated  so many things  tea was rattlesnake venom to her i embraced it   what did you drink marilyn i saw you only with a coke or a glass of wine in your hand our mother whom you felt damaged you  your life       spirals the twisting iridescent birds fly at me now                       scintillating spinning i blink  our mother drank many cups of coffee with cream a day our sad mother i blink  and tell it to go back to our childhood of muddy little shoes from walking in the spiderfilled orange groves there the damaging must have begun   she loving me so much more than you  i wish there had been more stories like the one about the origin of her disliking tea at 17 she went to celebrate being made teacher of the oneroom school she had attended and graduated from at her retiring teacher’s home she was served for the first time  tea she being from a german coffeedrinking family our mother hated it but politely choked it down would never again touch a drop of the poisonous beverage from that story we learned that our mother ritualized hating something  expected us to admire her for it i took that negative pattern and spun it until i could have cloth enough for an eloquent garment perhaps the lesson simply made you feel yourself            helpless         ragged                      torn  i never saw you that way marilyn though perhaps incomplete  i pour a cup of assam take a sip let it wash through my mouth down my agedamaged throat think of you sitting with me in your southern california backyard one may morning next to the camellia bush i as always with a cup of tea in my hand you smoking  i left all my family  you were part of it  left california and reinvented myself even mythologized myself as a tan “california girl” you did not become an artist or a poet  i suppose that’s why you felt damaged if only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice it took for me to get away so many small things can save us from the damage you talked of for me drinking that first cup of orange pekoe and making tea my drink      risking rattlesnake poison with every steaming cup a tiny emblem of a rebellion i still try to practice  you left us so quickly marilyn and without any warning this january your house full of cancelled aspirations  glass bowls and cylinders and huge globes filled with sea scallop shells you combed the california seashores to find collecting these empty shells washed free of their biological life                                 out of the ocean  we two different daughters of a sailor   april 3  the spinning                      the scissors               the measuring and thus our lives are given out from the heavens with unfair allotments and varied unaccountable fates born when we are and to whom  you would have prevailed in an age where women had to spin weave the material cut it into britches and dresses undergarments and sheets sew and keep clean warm and comfortable a household full or a castle full  men children hired hands maidservants  you would have  done it so well  but you would have died young in such a world  diabetes asthma chronic bronchial infections even in the 21st century where you lived to be 76       a world where all your skills were plied as substitute for being an artist  when i asked you a year ago not knowing that you would die this january what you would most like to have if money were not the object  since clearly all your measuring cutting and sewing had been for economical reasons not art  you thought for a bit raising your chin  “a swimming pool in my backyard one i could step into every morning swim float  maybe in the afternoon i’d go for a dip many evenings i think” she said to me                     longing for some ocean  in our portrait if someone paints it she will be sitting in a scallop shell her many jars of seashells behind her head i will be invisible except for the spinning murmuration of birds that radiates past me  they read at her funeral a poem from her journal about lying on the beach the sand embracing her how much she loved it  felt safe felt released oh marilyn all those seashells emptied of their living fleshy occupants the ugly parts that die and rot now glorious empty rooms in which to live an imaginary life to decorate to create beauty spaces to live a different life  what is left but your desires locked in glass and an image of you walking your beloved beaches hands full of seashells your footprints measured then quickly filled with the tidal flow   april 4  my spinning a whirlpool of faceted moving lights everything is numbers down into a vortical glare that replaces my own mind’s desire everything is numbers everything is numbers floating down like the crow’s onyx feather the 8 of spades random card appearing last week over gravel 8 legs on a spider the arachnid so many people seem to fear yet i lose track of time stare into the wall or any space to replace real images with my imaginary ones some random spider who spins my fate  crazy eights the child card game marilyn and i played  pieces of eight the dollar of pirate spain  our childhood in orange county  8 a vertical infinity sign everything is numbers  your fire opal that daddy brought to you from india and our mother paid a jeweler to set it into a ring you wore the ring more than sixty years i suppose it was on your finger at death spinning     spinning to scintillate and iridesce we never had nice shoes   april 5  easter sunday you and i always dyed easter eggs together our mother busy at her fortyhouraweek bookkeeper’s job i was intrigued with the colors but they never turned out so bright when coloring the eggs you the artist were interested in the designs to transfer onto the eggs cartoons bunnies chicks we kept our eggs separated from each other put them in separate bowls neither caring for the other’s creation still we felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects  not enough to make us friends  my unwillingness to be like our classmates embarrassed you you chose invisibility in school rather than being known as “diane’s sister”  that unwillingness to be like others was what made me a poet so many little things but that early decision of yours not to understand why i wanted to be weird is what made you make so many other small choices preventing you from becoming an artist “look away” our mother said to us when there were ugly things confronting us i could not do that you blame our mother yet it was you who decided to look away even though it meant not seeing the whole world even if meant you didn’t become an artist poverty of course was the reason  we never had nice shoes   april 6  all numbers have disappeared instead there are mushrooms fungi that has always seemed more artful than tasty  sipping a cup of tea  soothes me as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce never could  i feel stymied  a rider with no horse i want only to watch the stories unfold  the secret stories about why you chose to marry and have children  why  i did not  the stories i try to banish blot out replace with the diamond dog a murmuration of iridescent starlings and the spider of eight twirling on its silk line projecting infinity art  is made when you subject yourself to the unacceptable then dredge yourself out find a mineral replacement infinity iridescer irised feather scintillater a crystalline body whirls releasing me from the history the stories it’s so hard to tell until recent years my sister and i either ignored or disliked each other we fought continuously as children i have in my wrist a black bump that protrudes near a vein it’s the point of a pencil that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled for the long yellow weapon a pencil the weapon of a writer but there was no bleeding no seemingwound to be dressed we never told our mother both too ashamed of our brutality i’ve never asked a doctor about it the pencil lead encapsulated in my wrist nor ever spoken of it to anyone  i always wonder that so much must remain a secret  why we never had nice shoes   april 7  young marilyn old marilyn  there are places on this planet where i find it hard to detect any beauty therefore silence no nice shoes   april 8  there is silence   april 9  drinking a blend of traditional darjeeling with a touch of ceylon  this tea takes me back to a viennese visit drinking this very tea in the afternoon while my friend jonathan ate their famous sacher torte the tea seemed particularly aromatic  “lightly scented with oil of bergamot and a hint of genuine bourbon vanilla” wishing for the moment in the past to reappear i didn’t know the tea from the sacher hotel was as famous as the cake until i found in my upton tea catalogue a listing for “scented darjeeling” under the heading “earl grey blends” this tea any cup of tea  hard to believe no sad to think my mother almost spat out her first taste of tea  what worldly thing must i touch to bring marilyn back into my sedate life my sister marilyn who died in january  her hand  i’d like to imagine timidly touching her hand  marilyn’s hand her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring in that hand she’d be

 when we arrive at the lounge of everything with our bags handfuls of earth     the lives of our grandparents in our memory devices we expect an exchange of sorts     that is what we expect and i think everyone deep down expects that we will not turn back through a high window we will connect stars like line drawings translate the sparkles of the poet we will sign the fascinating mouth of the speaker we will sing lyrics that someone thought were pretty good we will sing them and we will not turn back     we will not  when our footsteps awaken fresh from a long complicated journey during which the planet slid otherwise we will likely remember a dream we had once and tell a version of it to the next person and the next and realize hopefully they also have a dream to tell and we will not do that thing where we won’t listen to anyone else’s dream we will listen and interpret     signing     singing     saying even though we have been instructed not to use ings we will use the wisdom disseminated by our devices we will not turn back  we will not if on arrival there is wringing of hands we will shake hands and in the eye of a storm we will make tea with our brilliant fading bodies we will do a variety of things while we can we will bed down on the steps of the assembly if we have to we will bed down in a court of law and all beds anyway are temporary and when we see that and realize we have traveled through the night we have traveled and are not turning back     that will be the point at which we will arrive

 there is ghazal swimming inside of her wanting to be born on the matter of foretelling of small miracles cactus flowers in bloom on this city fire escape where inside your tongue touches every inch of her skin where you lay your hand on her belly and sleep here she fingers the ornate remains of ancient mosques here some mythic angel will rise from the dust of ancestors’ bones this is where you shall worship at the intersections of distilled deities and memory’s sharp edges the country is quite a poetic place water and rock contain verse and metaphor even wild grasses reply in rhyme you are not broken she knows this having captured a moment of lucidity summer lightning bugs sun’s rays in a jelly jar  this is not a love poem but a cove to escape the flux however momentary she is still a child confabulating the fantastic please do not erode her wonder for the liquid that is your language there is thunderstorm in her chest wanting to burst through her skin this is neither love poem nor plea this is not river nor stone

 the wisest scholar of the wight most wise by phoebus’ doom with sugared sentence says that virtue if it once met with our eyes strange flames of love it in our souls would raise but for that man with pain this truth descries while he each thing in sense’s balance weighs and so nor will nor can behold those skies which inward sun to heroic mind displays virtue of late with virtuous care to stir love of herself takes stella’s shape that she to mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her it is most true for since i her did see virtue’s great beauty in that face i prove and find th’effect for i do burn in love

 let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine that bravely maskd their fancies may be told or pindars apes flaunt they in phrases fine enamling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold or else let them in statelier glory shine ennobling newfound tropes with problems old or with strange similes enrich each line of herbs or beasts which ind or afric hold for me in sooth no muse but one i know phrases and problems from my reach do grow and strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites how then even thus in stellas face i read what love and beauty be then all my deed but copying is what in her nature writes

 yes i was born on the street known as glassas paper scissors or rock  several of my ancestors had no hands  several of my ancestors used their pens  in odd ways  a child of seven i prayed for breath  each day i passed through the mirrored x    into droplets of rain congealed around dust  i never regretted this situation  though patient as an alchemist i failed to learn english  twenty years later i burned all my furniture  likewise the beams of my house  to fuel the furnace    once i bought an old boat  i abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams  and wrote about dresses jewels furniture and menus  eight or ten times in a book of dreams  it sets me to dreaming when i dust it off  our time is a between time best to stay out of it    send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living  so they won’t suspect we know they don’t exist  sign them sincerely yours warmest regards thinking of you or deepest regrets  brown river outside my window an old boat riding the current  what i like most is to stay in my apartment  so that is my life pared of anecdotes    i go out occasionally to look at a dance  otherwise the usual joys worries and inner mourning  occasionally in an old boat i navigate the river  when i find the time  water swallows the days  i think maybe that’s all    i have to say  except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me  it says a candle is consuming a children’s alphabet  it says attend to each detail of the futurepast  last night the moon was divided precisely in half  today a terrifying wind

 knoxville december 27 2016 for marilyn kallet’s 70th birthday this poem was constructed to carry any memory you want to hold close we arrived when the days grew legs of night chocolates were offered we ate latkes for hours to celebrate light and friends we will keep going despite dark or a madman in a white house dream let’s talk about something else said the dog who begs faithfully at the door of goodwill a biscuit will do a voice of reason meat sticks  i dreamed all of this i told her you me and paris  it was impossible to make it through the tragedy without poetry what are we without winds becoming words becoming old children born to children born to sing us into love another level of love beyond the neighbor’s holiday light display proclaiming goodwill to all men who have lost their way in the dark as they tried to find the car door the bottle hidden behind the seat reason to keep on going past all the times they failed at sharing love love it’s weak they think  or some romantic bullshit a movie set propped up behind on slats said the wizard of junk understanding who pretends to be the wise allknowing dog behind a cheap fan it’s in the plan for the new world straining to break through the floor of this one said the angel of allthatyouknowandforgotandwillfind as she flutters the edge of your mind when you try to sing the blues to the future of everything that might happen and will all the losses come tumbling down down down at three in the morning as do all the shouldn’thaves or shouldhaves it doesn’t matter girl  i’ll be here to pick you up said memory in her red shoes and the dress that showed off brown legs when you met him at the age you have always loved hair perfect with a little wave and that shine in your skin from believing what was impossible was possible you were not afraid you stood up in love in a french story and there fell ever a light rain as you crossed the seine to meet him for café in saintgermaindesprés you wrote a poem beneath the tender skin from your ribs to your hip bone in the slender then and you are still writing that song to convince the sweetness of every bit of straggling moonlight star and sunlight to become words in your mouth in your kiss  that kiss that will never die you will all ways fall in love it doesn’t matter how old how many days hours or memories we can fall in love over and over again the seine or tennessee or any river with a soul knows the depths descending when it comes to seeing the sun or moon stare back without shame remorse or guilt this is what i remember she told her husband when they bedded down that night in the house that would begin marriage that house was built of twentyfour doves rugs from india cooking recipes from seven generations of mothers and their sisters and wave upon wave of tears and the concrete of resolution for the steps that continue all the way to the heavens past guardian dogs dog after dog to protect they are humble earth angels and the rowdiest even nasty you try and lick yourself like that imagine and the old woman laughed as she slipped off her cheap shoes and parked them under the bed that lies at the center of the garden of good and evil she’d seen it all done it more than once tonight she just wanted a good sleep and picked up the book of poetry by her bed which was over a journal she kept when her mother was dying these words from may sarton she kept in the fourth room of her heart “love come upon him warily and deep  for if he startle first it were as well  to bind a fox’s throat with a gold bell as hold him when it is his will to leap” and she considered that every line of a poem was a lead line into the spirit world to capture a bit of memory pieces of gold confetti a kind of celebration we all want to be remembered even memory even the way the light came in the kitchen window when her mother turned up the dial on that cool mist color  of a radio when memory crossed the path of longing and took  mother’s arm and she put down her apron said “i don’t mind if i do” and they danced you watching as you began your own cache of remembering already you had stored the taste of mother as milk father as a labor of sweat and love and night as a lonely boat of stars that took you into who you were before you slid through the hips of the story there are no words when you cross the gate of forbidden waters or is it a sheer scarf of the finest silk or is it something else that causes you to forget nothing is ever forgotten says the god of remembering who protects the heartbeat of every little cell of knowing from the antarctic to the soft spot at the top of this planetary baby oh baby come here let me tell you the story of the party you will never forget no matter where you go where you are or where you will be when you cross the line and say no more no more greedy kings no more disappointments no more orphans or thefts of souls or lands no more killing for the sport of killing no more no more except more of the story so i will understand exactly what i am doing here and why she said to the fox guardian who took her arm to help her cross the road that was given to the care of natives who made sure the earth spirits were fed with songs and the other things they loved to eat they like sweets cookies and flowers it was getting late and the fox guardian picked up her books as she hurried through the streets of strife but it wasn’t getting late there was no late only a plate of tamales on the counter waiting to be or not to be at this age said the fox we are closer to the not to be which is the to be in the fields of sweet grasses wherever you are enjoy the evening how the sun walks the horizon before cross sing over to be and we then exist under the realm of the moon there’s where fears slay us in the dark of the howling mind we all battle befriend them the moon said as a crab skittered under her skirt her daughter in the high chair waiting for cereal and toast what a girl she turned out to be a willow tree a blessing to the winds to her family there she is married and we start the story all over again said her father in a toast to the happiness of who we are and who we are becoming as change in a new model sedan whips it down the freeway toward the generations that follow one after another in the original lands of the mvskoke who are still here nobody goes anywhere though we are always leaving and returning it’s a ceremony sunrise occurs everywhere in lizard time human time or a fern uncurling time we instinctually reach for light food we digest it make love art or  trouble of it the sun crowns us at noon the whole earth is a queen then there are always goodbyes at sunset say goodbye to hurt to suffering to the pain you caused others or yourself goodbye goodbye to carrie fisher the star wars phenomenon and george michael the singer they were planets in our emotional universe some of my memories are opened by the image of love on screen in an imagined future or broken open when the sax solo of “careless whisper” blows through the communal heart yes there’s a cosmic consciousness jung named it but it was there long before named by vedic and mvskoke scientists and there is a cosmic hearteousness  for the heart is the higher mind and nothing can be forgotten there no ever or ever how do i sing this so  i don’t forget ask the poets each word is a box that can be opened or closed then a train of words phrases garnered by music and the need for rhythm to organize chaos like right here now in this poem is the transition phase i remembered it while giving birth summer sun bearing down on the city melting asphalt but there we were my daughter and i at the door between worlds i was happier than ever before to welcome her happiness was the path she chose to enter and  i couldn’t push yet not yet and then there appeared a pool of the  bluest water we waited there for a breath to catch up and then it did and she took it that girl who was beautiful beyond dolphin dreaming and we made it we did to the other side of suffering this is the story our mothers tell but we couldn’t hear it in our ears stuffed with barbie advertising with our mothers’ own loathing set in place by patriarchal scripture the smothering rules to stop insurrection by domesticated slaves or wives it hurt everybody the fathers cannot know what they are feeling in such a spiritual backwash worship boxes set into place by the need for money and power will not beget freedom only warships for freedom freedom oh freedom sang the slaves the oar rhythm of the blues lifting up the spirits of peoples whose bodies were worn out or destroyed by a man’s slash hit of greed this is our memory too said america heredity is a field of blood celebration and forgetfulness don’t take on more than you can carry said the eagle to his twin sons fighting each other in the sky over a fox dangling between them it’s that time of the year when we eat tamales and latkes we light candles fires to make the way for a newborn child for fresh  understanding demons will try to make houses out of jealousy anger  pride greed or more destructive material they place them in a part of the body that will hold them liver heart knee or brain so my friend let’s let that go for joy for chocolates made of ashes mangos grapefruit or chili from oaxaca for sparkling wine from spain for these children who show up in our dreams and want to live at any cost because we are here to feed them joy your soul is so finely woven the silkworms went on strike said the mulberry tree we all have mulberry trees in the memory yard they hold the place for skinned knees earned by small braveries cousins you love who are gone a father cutting a  watermelon in the summer on the porch and a mother so in love that her heart breaks  it will never be the same yet all memory bends to fit the heart has uncountable rooms we turn to leave here and so will the hedgehog who makes a home next to that porch we become birds poems

 a boy who knew enough to save for something like the whim that took me downtown on the bus one lost saturday morning of my mother’s birthday i sat in the back where the gasoline smell made me dizzy and i closed my eyes but didn’t think of her only of myself basking in the light and love that would fall down on me when i handed her the box and she untied the bow to save and lifted something shining out and held it up before us like a promise taking shape for once in her hands though i didn’t know what to buy the bus door hissing behind me because i’m in some kind of state now a trance that comes when you pull at the cords of light that connect the mother to the boy the 1959 department store opening up before me like a jeweled city in lingerie i found myself surrounded by those torsos sheened in silk dreaming my mother feeling the silk against me the two of us moving through a cloudy room in a dance i can’t remember until shame comes from out of nowhere the matron frowned asked what i wanted hovered over me confused and afraid i whispered without thinking the black hose with rhinestones down the seams please and pointed to the pair across the room stretched over legs on the glass counter as if about to step off and i saw her in my mind slip them on her skirt hiked above the garters the sun catching in her tangled hair until the matron made a sound in her throat and looked at me with eyes that said what’s wrong with you dirty boy  all the way home a sweet ache rocked me the silver package riding my lap like a heavy wrong thing i couldn’t give up no matter how it dragged me down to a place where i could barely breathe or see or feel whatever happened that spinning afternoon she ran her fingers over the rhinestone seams or she didn’t she wore them out into an evening or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible things doesn’t matter i would find my way into the light of another woman into whose arms i fall nights my fingers can’t tear through the dark that eats me the silk stretched across her breasts the need for something womanly to raise me up pounding in my head until i curl in sleep away from those longings ancient and blue

 we were riding out to an abandoned farmhouse on his pearl black triumph  deaf to the sound of bleating sheep  that was when he told me it was the same model james dean had swapped for three days after  they’d finished filming east of eden  i tried to tell him that was cool but he didn’t act like he’d heard me so i hugged him tight  and set my head on his shoulder  and watched how the yellow moon was shifting behind the pines like the face of a jailbird  he’d told me before that his wife knew he didn’t swing her way but she was keeping quiet about it  for their kid’s sake  we rumbled into the dry grass and started cutting through the cornstalks  into a big clearing where he kicked the bike stand and told me to get off  he tossed his chrome aviators and then we started our hike to the farmhouse which was sagging in the field  opposite of us  we were quiet on the way like a couple of thieves about to rob someone blind  i stood back as he tore a warped door off the barn and flung it into the gravel  inside the air was dusty and thick and the moon was still with us cocked behind a streaked window  like we’d traded places  and now we were the jailbirds serving a lifetime sentence without parole  john pulled off his steeltoe boots and told me to wait for him up in the hayloft  i left my loafers there and climbed a wood ladder until i was looking into the eyes of a great horned owl  he kept shaking his head like he couldn’t believe what was about to happen  i was going to be john’s first  but while i was gathering the wet straw i smelled smoke and slid back down the ladder  that was when i saw the fire licking the crossbeams and ran outside  john was passing through the wheat like a final judgment  his figure was muscled with flame and i kept silent as he reached for a head of grain  and burned it to the ground

 just off the highway to rochester minnesota twilight bounds softly forth on the grass and the eyes of those two indian ponies darken with kindness they have come gladly out of the willows to welcome my friend and me we step over the barbed wire into the pasture where they have been grazing all day alone they ripple tensely they can hardly contain their happiness that we have come they bow shyly as wet swans they love each other there is no loneliness like theirs at home once more they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness i would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms for she has walked over to me and nuzzled my left hand she is black and white her mane falls wild on her forehead and the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear that is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist suddenly i realize that if i stepped out of my body i would break into blossom

 for part of one strange year we lived in a small house at the edge of a wood no neighbors which suited us nobody to ask questions except for the one big question we went on asking ourselves that spring myriads of birds stopped over briefly birds we’d never seen before drawn to our leafy quiet and our brook and because as we later learned the place lay beneath a flyway flocks appeared overnightbirds brilliant or dull with sharp beaks or crossed bills birds small and enormous all of them pausing to gorge at the feeder to rest their wings and disappear each flock seemed surer than we of a destination by the time we’d watched them wing north in spring then make an anxious autumn return we too had pulled it together and we too moved into what seemed to be our lives

 that dusty bubble gum once ubiquitous as starlings is no more my love whistling dinosaurs now populate only animation studios the furious actions of angels causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth and the busstations old urinals go under the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers graduate into the wrinklecausing sun the sea seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one long goodbye perpetually the tide recedes beaches dotted with debris unto each is given a finite number of addresses ditties to dart the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon the swords hilt glints the daffodils bow down all is temporary as a perfect haircut a kitten in the lap yet sitting here with you my darling waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw seems all eternity ill ever need and all eternity needs of me

 butter like love seems common enough yet has so many imitators i held a brick of it heavy and cool and glimpsed what seemed like skin beneath a corner of its wrap the décolletage revealed a most attractive fat  and most refined not milk not cream not even crème de la crème  it was a delicacy which assured me that bliss follows agitation that even pasture daisies through the alchemy of four stomachs may grace a kings table  we have a yellow bowl near the toaster where summers butter grows soft and sentimental we love it better for its weeping its nostalgia for buckets and churns and deep stone wells for the press of a wooden butter mold shaped like a swollen heart

 far far from here the adriatic breaks in a warm bay among the green illyrian hills and there the sunshine in the happy glens is fair and by the sea and in the brakes the grass is cool the seaside air buoyant and fresh the mountain flowers more virginal and sweet than ours  and there they say two bright and aged snakes who once were cadmus and harmonia bask in the glens or on the warm seashore in breathless quiet after all their ills nor do they see their country nor the place where the sphinx lived among the frowning hills nor the unhappy palace of their race nor thebes nor the ismenus any more  there those two live far in the illyrian brakes they had stayd long enough to see in thebes the billow of calamity over their own dear children rolld curse upon curse pang upon pang for years they sitting helpless in their home a grey old man and woman yet of old the gods had to their marriage come and at the banquet all the muses sang  therefore they did not end their days in sight of blood but were rapt far away to where the westwind plays and murmurs of the adriatic come to those untrodden mountainlawns and there placed safely in changed forms the pair wholly forgot their first sad life and home and all that theban woe and stray for ever through the glens placid and dumb

 according to lin yutang both po chuyi and su tungpo desperately admired tao yuanming  a poet of nature who wrote a single love poem a poem thought by chinese dilettantes to be the one blemish in a white jade  can a poet be faulted for calling a woman carelessly perfect in beauty  he chose to long for her by envying  the candle that glowed upon her beautiful face the shadow that followed in her every move  yet the nature poet tao yuanming at home with the sudden turning of seasons now feared the shadow in darkness  a discarded fan that once stirred her hair feared the candle at dawn at last believed that for beauty he had lived in vain

 trees in the old days used to stand and shape a shady lane where lovers wandered hand in hand who came from carentan  this was the shining green canal where we came two by two walking at combatinterval such trees we never knew  the day was early june the ground was soft and bright with dew far away the guns did sound but here the sky was blue  the sky was blue but there a smoke hung still above the sea where the ships together spoke to towns we could not see  could you have seen us through a glass you would have said a walk of farmers out to turn the grass each with his own hayfork  the watchers in their leopard suits waited till it was time and aimed between the belt and boot and let the barrel climb  i must lie down at once there is a hammer at my knee and call it death or cowardice don’t count again on me  everything’s all right mother everyone gets the same at one time or another it’s all in the game  i never strolled nor ever shall down such a leafy lane i never drank in a canal nor ever shall again  there is a whistling in the leaves and it is not the wind the twigs are falling from the knives that cut men to the ground  tell me mastersergeant the way to turn and shoot but the sergeant’s silent that taught me how to do it  o captain show us quickly our place upon the map but the captain’s sickly and taking a long nap  lieutenant what’s my duty my place in the platoon he too’s a sleeping beauty charmed by that strange tune  carentan o carentan before we met with you we never yet had lost a man or known what death could do

 perhaps you can tell children that the world is always a more beautiful place than you can suppose  and then you release them into their future the black row of trees in the distance  she died suddenly in midwinter in the same bed in which her husband died years earlier it still sagged on his side her second husband remained in japan with his first family  she used to say what my three girls do when they are on their own is unimaginable to me  my mother is the middle daughter a garden of inaudible tunes the four of them lived in a mean house in seoul  one yellowing picture of my grandmother remains and her face turns away from the camera as the rabbit senses the hound  she was said to be a solitary eater an inner thing what did she promise the world that she wasn’t able to make good on  a child who abruptly feels the frontiers of experience assert themselves in her at the funeral my mother cries so hard she can’t feel her hands for days  it explains how she scratches herself raw meaningless  you have always believed these are your themes fate the negative pleasures of dipping oneself in acid  you think it will rescue you from your simplicity remarks my mother from the doorway but art is never the ace in the hole  i am not a stupid child i am not even a child any longer with her hesitant then terrible certainty that loss is tragic not only pointless  when she is lonely my mother cooks and when she is happy she knows to hide it

 p entered a third space from which he could watch time pass instead of walking to the monastery in the middle of the night  his opaque sexuality derived from the absence of a guarantee that his person would remain intact  he recognized this in himself and we stared at the pylons regressing into the lackluster northeastern woods  the monastery was a display before which he claimed sangfroid a picturesque ruin to which he was conveyed as though by boreal fluid  everyone loved occasional works like this their allusions to complementary and absent events  weaving around proliferating drywall i despaired over this desire  p joined the migrant workforce and grew more disconsolate and distant and drunk in our presence  our presence was only possible because of advances in technology in a dialectical relationship with their debasement servers in cold rooms and a recursive void of woodblock chat sounds

 heart oh heart i sit here writing your name on pieces of paper folded hidden misplaced    found again  there is the element of saying and there is the element of making one needn’t choose i am singing the dream out from the ice asking it to carry me like a horse or a river down and away  this day here in panedglass sun the young waitress shaking out her apron and retying it flat across her stomach a bit of vanityher hair swept off her neck crash of a milk bottle on the granite counter cream spread in a mild pool toward the rim and the roots of habit and longing briefly seized by the mind  so noisy here the sound echoes out of years brought to this showing forth unrehearsed it seems we wake and find ourselves repeating embodying the ancient gestures by which we recognize ourselves completed  not one of us could be born and invent lifeit must show through us the arm flung in the air the coffee poured out and down the street someone hurrying by head down against the wind  and a man and a woman come to an old grief carved in them carved into them the old way of water wearing rock by law and the hatred between them is equal to the hope neither will release  each wants to be whole to embody all of time when nothing in this world is whole and this is by law  when my father said bitterly to my motheryou have changed he meant without meaning to say how she had changed him a man holds his head down against the wind yet the wind fills him with the dust of temples the breath of the dead  the dream of the light inside the branches a gleam of wet glimmer that is a bud the leaf within the bud  the photographer comes inside and closes the lens of his camera then he is the lens then my eye is the light this is the element of saying the young waitress flings a paper cup behind her into the trash can that is a saying the cream swirled into the coffee the sugar dissolving disembodied and the body of the manager disappears swallowed into a doorway  the element of making is slow uncertain as a temple a falling forward stitching back like a stone wall like the panes in an arched window like a repetition chosen beyond necessity  yet somehow we have seen all this before the girl in the fur hat speaking syrup into a phone the falseness of her charm is an ancient imposter familiar and therefore true a door is opened and falls closed suddenly at every table someone looks down and is reading books newspapers calendars reading tea leaves reading bones  a woman in a periwinkle jacket i am reading her shoulders as the day introspects in dream the passive construction and the past perfect tense prevail she was being pushed on a swing the woman with many television credits gazes out the window heavy with years forgetting herself forgetting sorrow the false husband the crippled child the old plots forgetting  and it is suddenly lovely as free as something read or dreamed the young waitress with sun on her faceher unblemished facelooks up from the middle of eternity her desire immaculate in the moment  when a word is beautiful above all othersyour name when a woman appears as a bird of prey and we turn away hoping not to be recognizedoh heart  when the light on the branches flares in a window with no sky this is old story reading us these are springs from words laid down before and ahead of us and in the moment we are making an answer

 cold eyelids that hide like a jewel hard eyes that grow soft for an hour the heavy white limbs and the cruel red mouth like a venomous flower when these are gone by with their glories what shall rest of thee then what remain o mystic and sombre dolores our lady of pain  seven sorrows the priests give their virgin but thy sins which are seventy times seven seven ages would fail thee to purge in and then they would haunt thee in heaven fierce midnights and famishing morrows and the loves that complete and control all the joys of the flesh all the sorrows that wear out the soul  o garment not golden but gilded o garden where all men may dwell o tower not of ivory but builded by hands that reach heaven from hell o mystical rose of the mire o house not of gold but of gain o house of unquenchable fire our lady of pain  o lips full of lust and of laughter curled snakes that are fed from my breast bite hard lest remembrance come after and press with new lips where you pressed for my heart too springs up at the pressure mine eyelids too moisten and burn ah feed me and fill me with pleasure ere pain come in turn  in yesterdays reach and tomorrows out of sight though they lie of today there have been and there yet shall be sorrows that smite not and bite not in play the life and the love thou despisest these hurt us indeed and in vain o wise among women and wisest our lady of pain  who gave thee thy wisdom what stories that stung thee what visions that smote wert thou pure and a maiden dolores when desire took thee first by the throat what bud was the shell of a blossom that all men may smell to and pluck what milk fed thee first at what bosom what sins gave thee suck  we shift and bedeck and bedrape us thou art noble and nude and antique libitina thy mother priapus thy father a tuscan and greek we play with light loves in the portal and wince and relent and refrain loves die and we know thee immortal our lady of pain  fruits fail and love dies and time ranges thou art fed with perpetual breath and alive after infinite changes and fresh from the kisses of death of languors rekindled and rallied of barren delights and unclean things monstrous and fruitless a pallid and poisonous queen  could you hurt me sweet lips though i hurt you men touch them and change in a trice the lilies and languors of virtue for the raptures and roses of vice those lie where thy foot on the floor is these crown and caress thee and chain o splendid and sterile dolores our lady of pain  there are sins it may be to discover there are deeds it may be to delight what new work wilt thou find for thy lover what new passions for daytime or night what spells that they know not a word of whose lives are as leaves overblown what tortures undreamt of unheard of unwritten unknown  ah beautiful passionate body that never has ached with a heart on thy mouth though the kisses are bloody though they sting till it shudder and smart more kind than the love we adore is they hurt not the heart or the brain o bitter and tender dolores our lady of pain  as our kisses relax and redouble from the lips and the foam and the fangs shall no new sin be born for mens trouble no dream of impossible pangs with the sweet of the sins of old ages wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore too sweet is the rind say the sages too bitter the core  hast thou told all thy secrets the last time and bared all thy beauties to one ah where shall we go then for pastime if the worst that can be has been done but sweet as the rind was the core is we are fain of thee still we are fain o sanguine and subtle dolores our lady of pain  by the hunger of change and emotion by the thirst of unbearable things by despair the twinborn of devotion by the pleasure that winces and stings the delight that consumes the desire the desire that outruns the delight by the cruelty deaf as a fire and blind as the night  by the ravenous teeth that have smitten through the kisses that blossom and bud by the lips intertwisted and bitten till the foam has a savour of blood by the pulse as it rises and falters by the hands as they slacken and strain i adjure thee respond from thine altars our lady of pain  wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining the light fire in the veins of a boy but he comes to thee sad without feigning who has wearied of sorrow and joy less careful of labour and glory than the elders whose hair has uncurled and young but with fancies as hoary and grey as the world  i have passed from the outermost portal to the shrine where a sin is a prayer what care though the service be mortal o our lady of torture what care all thine the last wine that i pour is the last in the chalice we drain o fierce and luxurious dolores our lady of pain  all thine the new wine of desire the fruit of four lips as they clung till the hair and the eyelids took fire the foam of a serpentine tongue the froth of the serpents of pleasure more salt than the foam of the sea now felt as a flame now at leisure as wine shed for me  ah thy people thy children thy chosen marked cross from the womb and perverse they have found out the secret to cozen the gods that constrain us and curse they alone they are wise and none other give me place even me in their train o my sister my spouse and my mother our lady of pain  for the crown of our life as it closes is darkness the fruit thereof dust no thorns go as deep as a roses and love is more cruel than lust time turns the old days to derision our loves into corpses or wives and marriage and death and division make barren our lives  and pale from the past we draw nigh thee and satiate with comfortless hours and we know thee how all men belie thee and we gather the fruit of thy flowers the passion that slays and recovers the pangs and the kisses that rain on the lips and the limbs of thy lovers our lady of pain  the desire of thy furious embraces is more than the wisdom of years on the blossom though blood lie in traces though the foliage be sodden with tears for the lords in whose keeping the door is that opens on all who draw breath gave the cypress to love my dolores the myrtle to death  and they laughed changing hands in the measure and they mixed and made peace after strife pain melted in tears and was pleasure death tingled with blood and was life like lovers they melted and tingled in the dusk of thine innermost fane in the darkness they murmured and mingled our lady of pain  in a twilight where virtues are vices in thy chapels unknown of the sun to a tune that enthralls and entices they were wed and the twain were as one for the tune from thine altar hath sounded since god bade the worlds work begin and the fume of thine incense abounded to sweeten the sin  love listens and paler than ashes through his curls as the crown on them slips lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes and laughs with insatiable lips thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses with music that scares the profane thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses our lady of pain  thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive in his lips all thy serpents shall nestle in his hands all thy cruelties thrive in the daytime thy voice shall go through him in his dreams he shall feel thee and ache thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him asleep and awake  thou shalt touch and make redder his roses with juice not of fruit nor of bud when the sense in the spirit reposes thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood thine thine the one grace we implore is who would live and not languish or feign o sleepless and deadly dolores our lady of pain  dost thou dream in a respite of slumber in a lull of the fires of thy life of the days without name without number when thy will stung the world into strife when a goddess the pulse of thy passion smote kings as they revelled in rome and they hailed thee rerisen o thalassian foamwhite from the foam  when thy lips had such lovers to flatter when the city lay red from thy rods and thine hands were as arrows to scatter the children of change and their gods when the blood of thy foemen made fervent a sand never moist from the main as one smote them their lord and thy servant our lady of pain  on sands by the storm never shaken nor wet from the washing of tides nor by foam of the waves overtaken nor winds that the thunder bestrides but red from the print of thy paces made smooth for the world and its lords ringed round with a flame of fair faces and splendid with swords  there the gladiator pale for thy pleasure drew bitter and perilous breath there torments laid hold on the treasure of limbs too delicious for death when thy gardens were lit with live torches when the world was a steed for thy rein when the nations lay prone in thy porches our lady of pain  when with flame all around him aspirant stood flushed as a harpplayer stands the implacable beautiful tyrant rosecrowned having death in his hands and a sound as the sound of loud water smote far through the flight of the fires and mixed with the lightning of slaughter a thunder of lyres  dost thou dream of what was and no more is the old kingdoms of earth and the kings dost thou hunger for these things dolores for these in a world of new things but thy bosom no fasts could emaciate no hunger compel to complain those lips that no bloodshed could satiate our lady of pain  as of old when the worlds heart was lighter through thy garments the grace of thee glows the white wealth of thy body made whiter by the blushes of amorous blows and seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers and branded by kisses that bruise when all shall be gone that now lingers ah what shall we lose  thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion and thy limbs are as melodies yet and move to the music of passion with lithe and lascivious regret what ailed us o gods to desert you for creeds that refuse and restrain come down and redeem us from virtue our lady of pain  all shrines that were vestal are flameless but the flame has not fallen from this though obscure be the god and though nameless the eyes and the hair that we kiss low fires that love sits by and forges fresh heads for his arrows and thine hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies with kisses and wine  thy skin changes country and colour and shrivels or swells to a snakes let it brighten and bloat and grow duller we know it the flames and the flakes red brands on it smitten and bitten round skies where a star is a stain and the leaves with thy litanies written our lady of pain  on thy bosom though many a kiss be there are none such as knew it of old was it alciphron once or arisbe male ringlets or feminine gold that thy lips met with under the statue whence a look shot out sharp after thieves from the eyes of the gardengod at you across the figleaves  then still through dry seasons and moister one god had a wreath to his shrine then love was the pearl of his oyster and venus rose red out of wine we have all done amiss choosing rather such loves as the wise gods disdain intercede for us thou with thy father our lady of pain  in spring he had crowns of his garden red corn in the heat of the year then hoary green olives that harden when the grapeblossom freezes with fear and milkbudded myrtles with venus and vineleaves with bacchus he trod and ye said we have

habit is lowly her temple of branches and sods most fruitful and virginal holy a mother of gods  she hath wasted with fire thine high places she hath hidden and marred and made sad the fair limbs of

and their places be taken the gods and the priests that are pure they shall pass and shalt thou not be shaken they shall perish and shalt thou endure death laughs breathing close and relentless in the nostrils and eyelids of lust with a pinch in his fingers of scentless and delicate dust  but the worm shall revive thee with kisses thou shalt change and transmute as a god as the rod to a serpent that hisses as the serpent again to a rod thy life shall not cease though thou doff it thou shalt live until evil be slain and good shall die first said thy prophet our lady of pain  did he lie did he laugh does he know it now he lies out of reach out of breath thy prophet thy preacher thy poet sins child by incestuous death did he find out in fire at his waking or discern as his eyelids lost light when the bands of the body were breaking and all came in sight  who has known all the evil before us or the tyrannous secrets of time though we match not the dead men that bore us at a song at a kiss at a crime  though the heathen outface and outlive us and our lives and our longings are twain  ah forgive us our virtues forgive us our lady of pain  who are we that embalm and embrace thee with spices and savours of song what is time that his children should face thee what am i that my lips do thee wrong i could hurt thee  but pain would delight thee or caress thee  but love would repel and the lovers whose lips would excite thee are serpents in hell  who now shall content thee as they did thy lovers when temples were built and the hair of the sacrifice braided and the blood of the sacrifice spilt in lampsacus fervent with faces in aphaca red from thy reign who embraced thee with awful embraces our lady of pain  where are they cotytto or venus astarte or ashtaroth where do their hands as we touch come between us is the breath of them hot in thy hair from their lips have thy lips taken fever with the blood of their bodies grown red hast thou left upon earth a believer if these men are dead  they were purple of raiment and golden filled full of thee fiery with wine thy lovers in haunts unbeholden in marvellous chambers of thine they are fled and their footprints escape us who appraise thee adore and abstain o daughter of death and priapus our lady of pain  what ails us to fear overmeasure to praise thee with timorous breath o mistress and mother of pleasure the one

no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now in the afterlife where a hawk humped up in the high weeds and a house on fire are a congruent sadness a brief history of nature’s one duty for flesh decay decay decay sometimes it is as if every bird in the afterlife trills this one song and i forget who i am but then i look down at my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name  till  till  till  and i know i am no farmer blade or mule driven over some roachragged road to field and fray and sometimes i forget how i came here to after life to pleasure to domestic violence to drive be driven and then i look down at my hands it is a war that brought you this peace a war that brought you this peace  and then i heard a question “shall we kill all of the masters” and before i brokered an answer i heard a voice say “then we must kill ourselves first and who will be left to kill the masters” i turned to find nothing but a boy in a tree and a girl beside him their heads tolling in the wind like peckerfretted fruit voice i said come now or do not come at all and there a man i had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field with a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face ezra is that you i asked “the peasants’ bent shoulders odysseus and the dead bullock  call me whatever you’d like i come to every name like a white ox toward pisa and the butcher’s road i come to paradise dragged by the hair  with one day’s reading and surrendered temple” you do talk funny i said “he do the police in different voices” he said and when all the voices sound like the police i said kill all the voices and so ran i ran from ezra who ran after me and demanded he be my guide “there is no running from the forest of men there is no running from men” i’ll be damned i said  but before i could finish ezra said “that’s right be damned  be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in paradise here be in your cage and free” but here is not the here i seek nor sought for that here harangues me and i might as well be the nigger coming over the obstacle fence a periplum of certain disaster a choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished your prince dear ezra hanging by his heels in the piazza the sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart for its divinity and pulse ezra nothing of you but the dead and so i ran past the possum running through the skull holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them into a wet testimony the possum testifying too to their death  coming going in ruins and floating out out beyond their murders and dropped plates out beyond the thameish rivers and its drowning traditions and then i looked back and saw ezra he had come to his cage and could go no farther “till” he said “bring me up from beneath these decks one slaver to another” he winked and i winked back handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket as i had done before dug a trench around him as another had done before then said “ezra be here in your cage and free” and ran  and then i came upon a mountain and then a chasm for which there was no bridge and so turned back to find a possum running behind me and i asked him dear possum what do we do with this darkness between us and the possum said nothing and ran on into the darkness into the chasm and fell speaking of the end of touch the desire to forget desire shadows the fear in a handful of dust a woman’s mouth fear i had known of and visited though now i cringed at the thought of that violence the violence that i brought  and so thought to throw myself too in that chasm when a hand touched my shoulder a voice said “not now maybe never on we go dear boy through this weather let’s find us another theory of light or darkness” then she laughed for it was a woman with a lit darkness and a careful chin glasses her body a tin of tender what do you know of me i asked she said “louis i know of you as i know fog  that it comes on through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament the city’s sight louis” she said “i’ve known all your light  but do you know mine” and i hadn’t i hadn’t “i was a taken city burning” she said “a burning house built to heal the sick a sick house full of healing the owl moccasin and panther  a rising for which there has never been such risen the total black i is the total black flame and fox and knot of the whatnots you would have forgotten if not for me i am perfect fucking memory nodominiondefied the godheadglittergussiedupforthegoingdown” and though i thought i saw i had not seen instead of one body three women and who and who and who i asked they laughed at my asking and said “you wouldn’t know us but we will tell you our names  mother song and holy yoke audre gwendolyn and lucille follow us or heel” and where and where should i follow you they did not answer instead they walked on the edge of the abyss laughing as if the abyss “we are what is whatnot the ever shimmying out of the neverwound louis do you follow or do you fall” they said “are you short or is you tall”  and on and on they played pleasured and pigeoned with each other kiting sound and word between them as i have seen lovers do passing cigarettes and smoke from one mouth to another the smoke the shared body of a god that has no master or mastering plan other than abiding in darkness abiding in both its coronation and crucifixion on and on we walked and i followed beyond the bears chortling pears from augustine’s outstretched hand out beyond the river scissoring the changing maple its leaves ambering then auburn then green each time a child appeared and touched its trunk we stopped watched i asked who are they and the one full of light and knives answered waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water but did not wade in and why don’t they wade in i asked she snickered quieted then said “wind and foxes what was never mine but was and was” as if she knew i did not understand continued “‘the ones i got but did not get’ the wild hair they could not grow but scratches me now as it did once in a dream our abortions louis our ones given and gave dem  the ones given all of their years at once and none or never” and when she spoke i saw another come to the shore and wave at me a boy given and gave the crushed color of late evening long after the pickers have come in and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening of their own water once again predicting the arch and strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march march to october and the battered soil i mean i turned from the one waving because i could not be beneath the stairs of his steering and stare paradise why do you bring me to such weather why would any man come down from his noose for this “because coming down is exactly the point all heavens lesser and below heaven noose not  you came to see what has become of death     ” the women spoke as one who had many tongues  all holy ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white stones and where are we going i asked “where language begins till paradise but over there”  •  and wasn’t this paradise that i had entered through the thick marsh waters out of the cane the crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank the intubated children with their gas masks hanging from their hands and wandering the sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new

 when awful darkness and silence reign over the great gromboolian plain through the long long wintry nights  when the angry breakers roar as they beat on the rocky shore  when stormclouds brood on the towering heights of the hills of the chankly bore   then through the vast and gloomy dark there moves what seems a fiery spark a lonely spark with silvery rays piercing the coalblack night  a meteor strange and bright  hither and thither the vision strays a single lurid light  slowly it wander  pauses  creeps  anon it sparkles  flashes and leaps and ever as onward it gleaming goes a light on the bongtree stems it throws and those who watch at that midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as the wild light passes along  the dong  the dong the wandering dong through the forest goes the dong the dong the dong with a luminous nose  long years ago the dong was happy and gay till he fell in love with a jumbly girl who came to those shores one day for the jumblies came in a sieve they did  landing at eve near the zemmery fidd where the oblong oysters grow and the rocks are smooth and gray and all the woods and the valleys rang with the chorus they daily and nightly sang  far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve  happily happily passed those days while the cheerful jumblies staid they danced in circlets all night long to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong in moonlight shine or shade for day and night he was always there by the side of the jumbly girl so fair with her skyblue hands and her seagreen hair till the morning came of that hateful day when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away and the dong was left on the cruel shore gazing  gazing for evermore  ever keeping his weary eyes on that peagreen sail on the far horizon  singing the jumbly chorus still as he sate all day on the grassy hill  far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve  but when the sun was low in the west the dong arose and said  what little sense i once possessed has quite gone out of my head  and since that day he wanders still by lake and dorest marsh and hills singing  o somewhere in valley or plain might i find my jumbly girl again for ever ill seek by lake and shore till i find my jumbly girl once more  playing a pipe with silvery squeaks since then his jumbly girl he seeks and because by night he could not see he gathered the bark of the twangum tree on the flowery plain that grows and he wove him a wondrous nose  a nose as strange as a nose could be of vast proportions and painted red and tied with cords to the back of his head  in a hollow rounded space it ended with a luminous lamp within suspended all fenced about with a bandage stout to prevent the wind from blowing it out  and with holes all round to send the light in gleaming rays on the dismal night  and now each night and all night long over those plains still roams the dong and above the wail of the chimp and snipe you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe while ever he seeks but seeks in vain to meet with his jumbly girl again lonely and wild  all night he goes  the dong with a luminous nose and all who watch at the midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as they trace the meteor bright moving along through the dreary night  this is the hour when forth he goes the dong with a luminous nose yonder  over the plain he goes he goes he goes the dong with a luminous nose

 i lov’d thee from the earliest dawn when first i saw thy beauty’s ray and will until life’s eve comes on and beauty’s blossom fades away and when all things go well with thee with smiles and tears remember me  i’ll love thee when thy morn is past and wheedling gallantry is o’er when youth is lost in age’s blast and beauty can ascend no more and when life’s journey ends with thee o then look back and think of me  i’ll love thee with a smile or frown ’mid sorrow’s gloom or pleasure’s light and when the chain of life runs down pursue thy last eternal flight when thou hast spread thy wing to flee still still a moment wait for me  i’ll love thee for those sparkling eyes to which my fondness was betray’d bearing the tincture of the skies to glow when other beauties fade and when they sink too low to see reflect an azure beam on me

 there is a spectacle and something is added to history it has as its object an indiscretion old age a gun the prevention of sleep  i am placed in its stead and the requisite shadow is yours it casts across me a violent coat  it seems i fit into its sleeve so the body wanders sometime it goes where light does not reach  you recall how they moved in the moon dusthop hop what they said to us from that distance was stupid they did not say i love you for example  the spectacle has been placed in my room can you hear its episode trailing pretending to be a thing with variegated wings  do you know the name of this thing it is a rubbing from an image the subject of the image is that which trespasses  you are invited to watch the body in complete dark casting nothing back the thing turns and flicks and opens

 my sister my sweet sister if a name dearer and purer were it should be thine mountains and seas divide us but i claim no tears but tenderness to answer mine go where i will to me thou art the same a lovd regret which i would not resign there yet are two things in my destiny a world to roam through and a home with thee  the first were nothinghad i still the last it were the haven of my happiness but other claims and other ties thou hast and mine is not the wish to make them less a strange doom is thy fathers sons and past recalling as it lies beyond redress reversd for him our grandsires fate of yore he had no rest at sea nor i on shore  if my inheritance of storms hath been in other elements and on the rocks of perils overlookd or unforeseen i have sustaind my share of worldly shocks the fault was mine nor do i seek to screen my errors with defensive paradox i have been cunning in mine overthrow the careful pilot of my proper woe  mine were my faults and mine be their reward my whole life was a contest since the day that gave me being gave me that which marrd the gifta fate or will that walkd astray and i at times have found the struggle hard and thought of shaking off my bonds of clay but now i fain would for a time survive if but to see what next can well arrive  kingdoms and empires in my little day i have outlivd and yet i am not old and when i look on this the petty spray of my own years of trouble which have rolld like a wild bay of breakers melts away somethingi know not whatdoes still uphold a spirit of slight patience not in vain even for its own sake do we purchase pain  perhaps the workings of defiance stir within meor perhaps a cold despair brought on when ills habitually recur perhaps a kinder clime or purer air for even to this may change of soul refer and with light armour we may learn to bear have taught me a strange quiet which was not the chief companion of a calmer lot  i feel almost at times as i have felt in happy childhood trees and flowers and brooks which do remember me of where i dwelt ere my young mind was sacrificd to books come as of yore upon me and can melt my heart with recognition of their looks and even at moments i could think i see some living thing to lovebut none like thee  here are the alpine landscapes which create a fund for contemplation to admire is a brief feeling of a trivial date but something worthier do such scenes inspire here to be lonely is not desolate for much i view which i could most desire and above all a lake i can behold lovelier not dearer than our own of old  oh that thou wert but with mebut i grow the fool of my own wishes and forget the solitude which i have vaunted so has lost its praise in this but one regret there may be others which i less may show i am not of the plaintive mood and yet i feel an ebb in my philosophy and the tide rising in my alterd eye  i did remind thee of our own dear lake by the old hall which may be mine no more lemans is fair but think not i forsake the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore sad havoc time must with my memory make ere that or thou can fade these eyes before though like all things which i have lovd they are resignd for ever or divided far  the world is all before me i but ask of nature that with which she will comply it is but in her summers sun to bask to mingle with the quiet of her sky to see her gentle face without a mask and never gaze on it with apathy she was my early friend and now shall be my sistertill i look again on thee  i can reduce all feelings but this one and that i would not for at length i see such scenes as those wherein my life begun the earliesteven the only paths for me had i but sooner learnt the crowd to shun i had been better than i now can be the passions which have torn me would have slept i had not sufferd and thou hadst not wept  with false ambition what had i to do little with love and least of all with fame and yet they came unsought and with me grew and made me all which they can makea name yet this was not the end i did pursue surely i once beheld a nobler aim but all is overi am one the more to baffled millions which have gone before  and for the future this worlds future may from me demand but little of my care i have outlivd myself by many a day having survivd so many things that were my years have been no slumber but the prey of ceaseless vigils for i had the share of life which might have filld a century before its fourth in time had passd me by  and for the remnant which may be to come i am content and for the past i feel not thankless for within the crowded sum of struggles happiness at times would steal and for the present i would not benumb my feelings further nor shall i conceal that with all this i still can look around and worship nature with a thought profound  for thee my own sweet sister in thy heart i know myself secure as thou in mine we were and arei am even as thou art beings who neer each other can resign it is the same together or apart from lifes commencement to its slow decline we are entwindlet death come slow or fast the tie which bound the first endures the last

 first night opened out bodies took root from rotting salt and seawater into evidence of red life relentless waves pumped tidal air into a single heartbeat  in the pulp of shadow and space water sucked our people from sleep that’s how it all began at least that’s all we can remember to tell it began with water and heartbeat  in minutes we tunneled through corn woman’s navel into tinges of moist red men and women yawning we collected our chins knees breasts and surefooted determination  a few thousand years before moses parted the red sea and the god with three heads was born in the middle east the choctaw people danced our homeland infra red  finally when the stranger’s arms reached to strangle the west grandmother eavesdropped on the threefaced deity who said that chaos was coming  when he puckered his lips and tried to kiss her she made it rain on him “maybe you’ve forgotten you were born of water and women” she said walking away laughing

 imagine a child from virginia or new hampshire alone on the prairie eighty years ago or more one afternoonthe shaggy pelt of grasses for the first time in that child’s life flowing for miles imagine the moving shadow of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean the obliterating strangeness like a tide that pulls or empties the bubble of the child’s imaginary heart no hills no trees  the child’s heart lightens tending like a bubble towards the currents of the grass and sky the pure potential of the clear blank spaces  or imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie head resting against a pumpkin in evening sun groundcherry bushes grow along the furrows the fruit red under its papery mothshaped sheath grasshoppers tumble among the vines as large as dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth the ground is warm to the child’s cheek and the wind is a humming sound in the grass above the draw rippling the shadows of the redgreen blades the bubble of the child’s heart melts a little because the quiet of that air and earth is like the shadow of a peaceful death limitless and potential a kind of space where one dissolves to become a part of something entire  whether of sun and air or goodness and knowledge it does not matter to the child dissolved among the particles of the garden or into the motion of the grass and air imagine the child happy to be a thing  imagine then that on that same wide prairie some people are threshing in the terrible heat with horses and machines cutting bands and shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers the chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun burning as if it could set the chaff on fire imagine that the people are swedes or germans some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks trying to get the meager shade a man a tramp comes laboring across the stubble like a mirage against that blank horizon laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall miragelike images of the tilted threshers clattering in the heat because the swedes or germans have no beer or else because they cannot speak his language properly or for some reason one cannot imagine the man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands a minute or two then waves to one of the people a young girl or a child and jumps headfirst into the sucking mouth of the machine where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces while the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie  the obliterating strangeness and the spaces are as hard to imagine as the love of death  which is the love of an entire strangeness the contagious blankness of a quiet plain imagine that a man who had seen a prairie should write a poem about a dark or shadow that seemed to be both his and the prairie’sas if the shadow proved that he was not a man but something that lived in quiet like the grass imagine that the man who writes that poem stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt should prove to himself that he was like a shadow or like an animal living in the dark in the dark proof he finds in his poem the man might come to think of himself as the very prairie the sod itself not lonely and immune to death  none of this happens precisely as i try to imagine that it does in the empty plains and yet it happens in the imagination of part of the country not in any place more than another on the map but rather like a place where you and i have never been and need to try to imagineplace like a prairie where immigrants in the obliterating strangeness thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow or prairiewhere you and i with our other ways more like the cities or the hills or trees less like the clear blank spaces with their potential are like strangers in a place we must imagine

 the factory stands on the train of your town’s wedding gown dirtying it and smoking  unfiltered cigarettes embarrassed the clouds rush to cover up the track marks of the stars  on your way home from the factory run theater it’s too dark to say hello to the palefaced people  plummeting past you and your son who knows what bright things they conceal in their black coats  now that they’ve rationed the rations home before curfew the iodine tablets fume in the bedtime  glass of water your son requests he sips it as if it were hot tea while you read to him yet again  that ancient story you three loved you stumble over the new language but even it is becoming  beautiful you close the book kiss his forehead stand the flashlight upright by the fuming glass  and stumble to your bed in the dark your son will wake in the night and turn on the flashlight  so he can see the water that he will turn into urine that you will carry in an armful  of sheets down to the river that gray dappled broken thing running  through the dying trees like an app aloosa spooked by gunfire

 their singer suffered breakdowns in their work there was a sense of what it was to live there at that time one song described the dark around the military vehicles between them and the cocaine waiting in gramercy it was about the sepsis that followed love or love repeated as farce the neck neck neck damaged by an anonymous hand unstringing guitars they got away with it and worked to abolish youth by knitting and paying halfattention i thought i was in love because my sentiments were matched by a generic abiding sense of unfreedom nothing survives lovers descrying the red flags of old flames nothing is more relatable than an unreasonable person operating subtractively indulgently out of exasperation

 after the clash of elevator gates and the long sinking she emerges where a slight thing in the morning’s crosstown glare she looks up toward the window where he waits then in a fleeting taxi joins the rest of the huge traffic bound forever west  on such grand scale do lovers say goodbye even this other pair whose high romance had only the duration of a dance and who now taking leave with stricken eye see each in each a whole new life forgone for them above the darkling clubhouse lawn  bright perseids flash and crumble while for these who part now on the dock weighed down by grief and baggage yet with something like relief it takes three thousand miles of knitting seas to cancel out their crossing and unmake the amorous rough and tumble of their wake  we are denied my love their fine tristesse and bittersweet regrets and cannot share the frequent vistas of their large despair where love and all are swept to nothingness still there’s a certain scope in that long love which constant spirits are the keepers of  and which though taken to be tame and staid is a wild sostenuto of the heart a passion joined to courtesy and art which has the quality of something made like a good fiddle like the rose’s scent like a rose window or the firmament

on the other  his best friend was from mobile i always wanted to go there  he died too soon or i left home i can’t remember  two days ago my stepfather’s body was laid to rest  comatose sucking air through a respirator i can’t say  he was resting i saw him underground when i closed  my eyes at night and went to bury the clock under mounds  of towels and pillowsi had not heard it ticking so ferociously  while he livedand it would not quiet down and the rain  tonight it’s not like any other and i wish the bus would go faster  i saw the rain in the heavy hanging clouds that’s a lie immense factories  blackening under a charcoal sky and rivers whose names i’ll never remember  i saw a sign reflected in my window milwaukee light     whenever the chicago white sox beat the braves it made his day  the braves were in milwaukee then with lefty warren spahn and slugger hank aaron  the bus company is peter pan and the peter pan coffee shop  was our first stop in chicago when we drove in and that’s where i was when  though i didn’t know it then he married my mother in bermuda  watching peter pan in new york with my “real” father…  and oh those prophetic lines not to grow up never to go to school  never then to die only the living are immortal like these rain clouds    the fact of deatha silence attends it an absence with which we’re all    he was the lightest sleeper i’d ever known he’d open one eye if i merely peeked into his room  intimate he’s there when i close my eyes but not when i reach out in the dark  at his bedside i peeled back his eyelids rubbed his blue feet his bloated hands  almost screamed in his ear wake up man i’ll be lonely without you  i’ll be angry if you don’t wake up and in the silence of our nearness to death  the grinding hum of the generators working at their limit for too long  to pump cool air in the killing heat the glug of him swallowing through the respirator    at the bus station in springfield massachusetts  the lateness of the bus angers a tough young woman from montana  travelling with her toddler son and yet she knows the way i can see it  in her green peaked cap her direct taut angerbus late  i kill the driverboy knock over suitcasei kill him too    bus boarded  the water bubbles on the windows break there is less and less outside to see…  and he was not even my real father that should put a cap on it  it’s like knowing the name of the lake you pass never seeing it again and yet  finding it tough to forget that jagged square of black water  just off the highway that lake and not another    baudelaire boasted that he laughed at funerals and wept at feasts  now in the bus it’s only early evening i turn around and everyone’s sleeping  mother and son matron and magician halfawake i stare at the tree line  and the blessing of rain and i would like to lie down on the roadside  and drink and drink and roll in the mud    mortifying one’s presence in the face of nature’s sanguine gaze  green whitewashing the past whatever grooms  the body for the afterlife pitches in this life like a tent  in a night encampment before the dawn storming of the fortress  the yellow day lilies wag their heads at the first  touch of wind and i see what others have always seen  in flowers a sign marked transients  that keeps them awake see now as standing catatonic  at the kitchen sink the overhead fluorescent light strip sinks into the pitch  dark bottom of a coffee mug seeing is native to us and yet  we stupefy our native sight not the eye’s sight    some mourners hurl dirt stiffly on the coffin because it seems the right thing to do  some hold back the flagdraped casket honors the first army chaplain in the pacific theater  for praying good prayers above the bodies of the dead and of the living   prelude to an afterword  why should i feel compelled to write a thousand postscripts when i don’t work from life but to hear the testimonials of people  who knew the rider the “little rabbi” moves me to tears while i am here to attend my mother who lies in bed with her stomach reaching  toward the skywhere sam talks calmly to his “grandpa in heaven” matteroffact celestial discourse and i listen to this baptist preacher  and hospice worker as he crouches beside my chair in her hospital room talk about his work with mourning how difficult it is to get people to understand  the element of surpriseovertime… how he kissed the little rabbi the first time he met him and the last time he saw him  before “death took him so swiftly” there were no “last words” and he was enveloped in silence in absence“the way death often  comes” i see him more clearly through this stranger’s eyes i wouldn’t have thought that he could help confirm my sense of what is real  but this man who knew him less than two years feels so indebted that i allow myself to think of the rider’s life in terms of the people he affected the bizarre love he could  elicitnot standard preacherly fare by any means but some connection by being entirely present for others promiscuously present  meanwhile as the nurses haul my mother from wheelchair to bed why do i feel impelled to turn away… we think we have the answers …  and flash to an image of my friend caring for her fatherbathing himbut she didn’t come out of his penis did she or is that another wrong turning in my thought  the hospice preacher offers a prayer he holds my mother’s swollen psoriatic hand the arthritic clumps poling from her fingers and as the dry flaky patches blaze  in the unforgiving light i find not a word to object toexcept two “religion” and “churches” i tell him that i left home as soon as i could because i couldn’t stand  being around the two of them he admits he always felt sick “for hours afterward” when he’d been with them together it wasn’t just quarreling i have to add  seeking absolution for my absence but hatred can’t let my mother milk the bereaved widow role he nods matteroffactly and sets me free

 act 2 scene 2 clindor a young picaresque hero has been living by his wits in paris but has now drifted to bordeaux to become the valet of a braggart bravo named matamore he is chiefly employed as a gobetween carrying matamores amorous messages to the beautiful isabellewho only suffers the master because she is in love with the messenger clindor  sir why so restless is there any need with all your fame for one more glorious deed have you not slain enough bold foes by now and must you have fresh laurels for your brow  matamore  its true im restless and i cant decide which of two foes should first be nullified the mogul emperor or the persian sophy  clindor  ah let them live a while sir neither trophy would add a great deal to your fame and standing and wheres the army that youd be commanding  matamore  army ah villain coward do you doubt that with this arm alone id wipe them out the mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield and drives divisions from the battlefield my wrath against these rulers needs engage only a piddling portion of my rage with one commandment given to the fates i oust the strongest monarchs from their states thunders my cannon my troops the destinies one blow lays low a thousand enemies one breath and all their hopes go up in smoke yet you dare speak of armies what a joke no longer shall a second mars employ you with but a glance you rogue i shall destroy you       and yet the thought of her whom i adore softens me now and im enraged no more that little archer whom every god obeys forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays observe how my ferocity which hates and hacks and slaughters gently dissipates when i recall my lady and my face is changed by thoughts of beauty love and grace  clindor  oh sir you have a hundred selves or more youre as handsome now as you were grim before i cant imagine any lady who could stubbornly refuse her heart to you  matamore  whatever i may have said feel no alarm sometimes i terrify sometimes i charm depending on my humor i inspire men with anxiety women with desire before i had the power to suppress my beauty women gave me much distress when i appeared they swooned in quantity and thousands died each day for love of me with every princess i had many a tryst and every queen came begging to be kissed the ethiopian and the japanese murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas two sultanesses could not but adore me two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me which strained my friendship with the turkish nation  clindor  their anger could but gild your reputation  matamore  still all that was more trouble than it was worth it balked my plans for conquering the earth whats more i tired of it and to deter such nuisances sent word to jupiter that if he could not put a stop to these fond women and their importunities id rise up in a rage and end his reign as ruler of the gods and would obtain for mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder needless to say the coward knuckled under he did as i desired and now you see im handsome only when i choose to be  clindor  what love notes youd receive were that not so  matamore  dont bring me any            unless from her you know what does she say of me  clindor  today she said that you inspire all hearts with love and dread and that if what you promise her comes true shell feel herself a goddess thanks to you  matamore  back in the times ive just been speaking of goddesses also pestered me for love and i shall tell you of a strange event which caused confusion without precedent and threw all nature into disarray the sun was powerless to rise one day because that bright muchworshipped deity could not find where the dawn his guide might be he sought her everywhere in cephalus bower in old tithonus bed in memnons tower but since aurora nowhere was in sight the day till noontide was as black as night  clindor  where was the goddess during these alarms  matamore  in my bedchamber offering me her charms but she gained nothing by such shameless actions my heart was blind to all her bright attractions and all she got by showing off her beauty was a firm command to go and do her duty  clindor  that curious story sir i now recall i was in mexico where i heard it all they said that persia vexed by the insult to their famous sun god had it in for you  matamore  i heard as much and would have made them pay but was in transylvania that day where their ambassador hastened to appease my wrath with presents and apologies  clindor  your brave heart showed them clemency how fine  matamore  just look my friend upon this face of mine there every human virtue can be found of all the foes ive stamped into the ground whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside there was not one who did not fall through pride but those who humbly honored my perfection have kept their power through a wise subjection the modest kings of europe are all my vassals i do not sack their towns or wreck their castles i let them reign but its another story in africa where i scorched the territory of certain kings who lacked humility and left great deserts there for all to see those endless sands beneath those skies of fire are a great monument to my righteous ire  clindor  let us revert to love your ladys here  matamore  my cursèd rivals at her side i fear  clindor  where are you going  matamore  he isnt brave this dunce and yet hes vain and could be bold for once perhaps hell challenge me from foolish pride merely because hes at the ladys side  clindor  by doing so the fool might come to harm  matamore  i cant be valorous when im full of charm  clindor  cease to be charming and be terrible sir  matamore  oh you dont realize what that would incur i cant be terrible by halves you know id slaughter both my mistress and my foe until they part lets stand aside and wait  clindor  your prudence like your valor is very great  they withdraw to a corner

 after pavese under the trellised arbor and our supper’s over in the memory i’ve found myself inside  l not speaking and beside us the river sliding softly by now the light will fade  to moonlit water and in memory i work to make this lingering accurate and sweet  white ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes first to her lips then to mine i may as well speak  to moonlight as to her and the walls of bruges light up again a costume jewelry pearl string  her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze in memory’s flammable celluloidflaring  and gone replaced by bread and grapes a checkered tablecloth the two chairs stare each other down  empty now upon which moonlight flickered all night the bread and grapes drip mist as dawn  carves the morning with a chilly wind slicing away both moon and fog now someone  without a name appearsfirst the fevered hands dustdevil quick that grope for the food in vain  then the pale light shows the open mouth and rippling throat white face on black water  sparrowflock fast its spiraling path but the bread and grapes stay where they were  their smell tormenting that famished ghost helpless to even lick away the dew that gathers  on the grapes blue fluted sides of the wineglasses dawnlight everything dripping wet and the chairs  stare at each other alone sometimes on the riverbank you can sense an odorof grapes or sex or memory  it swirls through the moonlit grass and now wakes someone always mute someone without a body  weaving also through the halflit grass the hoarse wail of someone who cannot speak  who reaches out but cannot touch the grass and only the nostrils flare now the dawn will break  late autumn cold to crave so endlessly the warmth the bloodpulsing fingertip the body to embrace  the pungent smells commingling to rise like breath and slither through the trees and tangle every branch  in this unappeasable longing this endless lust for touch and smell which afflicts the dead  the souls in the trees face the gathering light other times in the ground the rain torments them

 before the war leaned in and blew out the candles there were many long days where lovers called themselves lovers and a house was a dream but also four walls a roof a father called to his daughter to see the monarch butterflies pausing in their migration to fan the goldenrod a tiger in each coy disclosure a young man reached for a blackberry and found draped on a branch a green snake the color of matcha a snake the color of matcha sighed in the sun people drove in cars there were jobs and someone had to work every morning a man quit his job but it was no tragedy he didn’t like the work another man slid in and found it comfortable enough and just as easily slid in beside the man’s wife and into the everyday rhythms of his life and that was no tragedy either after rains a ring of mushrooms would delicately crack the earth spanish moss harbored red mites the sky wasn’t interesting no one looked up

lips and histories in the metropolitan streets  my surgery is criminal  no one has been able to identify the skeletons the remains the thousand scattered nerves of personages i’ve gathered in order to bring this figure back to life the scars are numberless and invisible  who would suspect a grafik artist who would suspect this gray table as a chamber of murders instruments the pencil sleeping with its yellow blanket and rubber crown a magazine of memories smiling women men’s suits and watches like drops like science tubes of smothered ink sounding like small seas pounding a universe of plastic

abandoned man in room 200 fall out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water he hears the iv tubes bursting the sweet plasma spinning between the walls the bag slipping to the floor and splattering

on a little ranch at the outskirts of an unknown town the mountains reflect the afternoon’s coppery heat from afar you can see birds crossing above the saguaros and the sky  the last time i saw randi was at san francisco city college he had just turned in all his papers so he could drop out at midterm he didn’t want to go on with it it was a farce  like when he was invited to read poetry near the

 as you told it to me  our clearest most reflective conversations so often then and there in the middle of the night staring into the darkness from wherever the mind has perched in its wanderings  you left your mother and the home aide upstairs and went down into your father’s basement workroom to look for the right size screws in her own wanderings she has tugged off the front door lock paneled in warped wood and abandoned like a mine you find the string for the light in the middle of the room as he must have known how to find it in the dark and again you see the pegboard walls covered with constellations of polishing tools the larger buffers hooked onto the paneling like fuzzy planets the smaller ones stuck in a lucite block he customized to hold them like the varied moons those hanging planets might need or a miniature copse of fantastical trees so too the seethrough brick in which he drilled holes for the array of drill bits themselves their swirled metal tops imitating a skyline of onion domes and tapered gothic towers the room’s order had been disturbed by time and the band saw jigsaw the sander and freestanding machines the sized wrenches pliers picks awls and extra parts still hanging in their packages the staple gun lamps brushes gooseneck magnifying glass soldering wire conversion charts the hundreds of other disordered tools they might have been words in an encyclopedia before you could read more than a few words and for you they were part of your father’s speech or maybe more like your mother’s now jumbled rarely creating a sentence with these tools he had sculpted a perfect cluster of grapes still on their vine and still with their leaves a wave and a school of dolphins breaching a formal replica of the brooklyn bridge with all its cabling a bouquet of flowers  surfaces so smooth and rounded objects so like their living counterparts we had no choice but to understand the power of creation running through the mind then tools and hands like a current you looked around for the right size screws and came upon a small box marked green permanent and when you opened it you saw small tubes of paint now just mud without his attention you said holding both the power of what we do and the sadness that it has to end

 there are stones even here worn into a malevolence by time gritting the teeth and tearing the eyes with the memory  out in the desert the wind is a sculptor working the ephemera of sand desperately editing steles to write the names of thousands of slaves who died to make pharaoh great it is a fool’s game  and we are like the blind musician at the hotel who tells us with a smile i’ll see you later  the guard at the pyramid eyes me are you egyptian he demands then searches my bag for a bomb at the hotel they speak arabic to me don’t treat me like the white guests and i guess even here with all the hindsight of history we haven’t learned to love ourselves  i cannot crawl into the tombs and cannot explain why how do you say in my country they buried me alive for six months and so you lie and tell yourself this is love i am protecting the world from my rage  rabab tells me we know how to build graves here i nod i know it is the same all over africa  do you have a knife do you have one the guards at the museum ask breyten and me searching us we call this on ourselves we are clearly political criminals  i trace the glyphs chipped into stone as a writer i am drawn to this if i could i too would carve myself into eternity breyten watching me says don’t tell me you’ve found a spelling mistake in it  a line of miniature statues is placed into the tomb to serve the pharaoh one for each day of the year four hundred the overseers are a plus i think even death will not ease the lot of the poor here  statues it seems the more i search the world for differences the more i find it all the same perhaps the buddha was a jaded traveler too when he said we are all one  mona argues about who should pay to see the mummies it isn’t often i can treat a girl to a dead body breyten insists  a woman nearby tells her husand she can see dead bodies at work why pay do you think she works in a hospital i ask that or the us state department breyten agrees  from the top of bab zwelia flat rooftops spread out like a conference of coffee tables broken walls furniture pots litter the roofs like family secrets sunning themselves two white goats on a roof chew their way through the debris  on the nile rabab sings in arabic tells me she wants to be celine dion she is my sister calling me home to egypt perhaps one day i will be ready for now it is enough to know i can be at home here

 the legendary muscle that wants and grieves the organ of attachment the pump of thrills and troubles clinging in stubborn colonies  like pulpy shorelife battened on a jetty slashed by the little deaths of sleep and pleasure they swell in the nurturing spasms of the waves  sucking to cling and even in death itself baked frozenthey shrink to grip the granite harder “rid yourself of attachments and aversions”  but in her father’s orchard already he says he’d like to be her bird and she says sweet yes yet i should kill thee with much cherishing  showing that she knows alreadyas art pepper that first time he takes heroin already knows that he will go to prison and that he’ll suffer  and knows he needs to have it or die and the one who makes the general lose the world for love lets him saywould i had never seen her but oh  says enobarbus then you would have missed a wonderful piece of work which left unseen would bring less glory to your travels among  the creatures in the rocktorn surf a wave of agitation a gasp a scholar quips shakespeare was almost certainly homosexual  bisexual or heterosexual the sonnets provide no evidence on the matter

 my mare when she was in heat would travel the fenceline for hours wearing the impatience in her feet into the ground  not a stallion for miles i’d assure her give it up  she’d widen her nostrils sieve the wind for news be moving again her underbelly darkening with sweat then stop at the gate a moment wait to see what i might do oh i knew how it was for her easily recognized myself in that wide lust came to stand in the pasture just to see it played offered a hand a bucket of grain a minute’s distraction from passion the most i gave  then she’d return to what burned her the fence the fence so hoping i might see might let her free i’d envy her then to be so restlessly sure of heat and need and what it takes to feed the wanting that we are  only a gap to open the width of a mare the rest would take care of itself surely surely i knew that who had the power of bucket and bridle she would beseech me sidle up be gone as life is short but desire desire is long

 we scratch at the backyard together through leaf mould worm casings she kicks off in a fan behind her i use a stick to dig to find for her what she’s shown me near the roots at the edge of a stepsticky slug on the underside of a hosta’s leaf how complicated she is and how resigned between her beak and my outstretched hand the worm’s writhing then the long slick going down it fills the throat like all that’s swallowed her head chucks it back for the worm again dark the hen’s pupil dilates she wends and follows  her queries sighs low gurgles the hastening click of her nails on pavement then hungry again into the grass grubs are larger than pale yellow larvae i prize from inside chestnuts these mucousy blind wanderers she eats right from my palm nevertheless i am repulsed by my husband’s embrace i turn now from his thick belly breasts his interests a body i had clambered over loved i scrabble struggle i cover myself another sticky truth dug up that i must rebury sorry on hands and knees hungry and wary

 or will we be lost forever  in the silence of the last breath not taken  the blue sweep of your arm like a dancer clowning in wrinkled pajamas  across the sky the abrupt brief zigzag of a jay  all night the whiteness and all day  once we have been lifted up into empty morning like ice  in the darkness of these white fields  neither the ghost tracks of skis nor steel skates will wake us  where are we looking for each other separated  on the opposite hillside i see you miles away from me a dot  of faint color reddening small bruised warmth opening its cranberry mouth and saying  what are you saying    under a cold blanket  an immense loneliness stretches in every direction with no fences  a few sticks tweak the crusted snow  thin remnants of an army of lost soldiers  i see footsteps ahead of me but whose  and where will they lead me parallel or converging is it not possible there will be one jet trail  that will not vanish  two phantom ribbons unfolding that will not feather themselves away    wrapped in our white parkas  in what shifting laminations snowflakes that mean nothing transparent eyes spitting  what glacier will we choose to lie on in what igloo rest  barely breathing in an air pocket just below the surface  rustling beneath blizzards  where is your foot most beautiful with blue toenails  i will be looking for it always  wherever it is next to me in the darkness  of rumpled white sheets pale siftings clouds  sudden scarves of ourselves gusting loose sandpapery as snow lifting  in what chill citadel of ice crystals will i find you

 your hands lie open in the long fresh grass the fingerpoints look through like rosy blooms your eyes smile peace the pasture gleams and glooms neath billowing skies that scatter and amass all round our nest far as the eye can pass are golden kingcup fields with silver edge where the cowparsley skirts the hawthornhedge tis visible silence still as the hourglass  deep in the sunsearched growths the dragonfly hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky so this wingd hour is dropt to us from above oh clasp we to our hearts for deathless dower this closecompanioned inarticulate hour when twofold silence was the song of love

 they are all gone away the house is shut and still there is nothing more to say  through broken walls and gray the winds blow bleak and shrill they are all gone away  nor is there one today to speak them good or ill there is nothing more to say  why is it then we stray around the sunken sill they are all gone away  and our poor fancyplay for them is wasted skill there is nothing more to say  there is ruin and decay in the house on the hill they are all gone away there is nothing more to say

 i did something i could never discuss made an acquaintance and embraced him in a phone booth  while interested parties lurked among free newspaper boxes he removed his domino  what to construe from leather bracelets the impossibility of translation from a phone booth to a churchyard  a gate painted white a belfry with no bell some culture with haceks the sense of lolling in a park  from a churchyard to a community garden heckling the rooster as it crowed  we left the part we liked jeering the rooster from a sward  we reentered the garden with a script but refused to expand on the vestiges of happiness  a girl took responsibility for the garden and plied us with background information until her nervous guardian sent us back to the church with a coat of arms where we were going anyway as though under the influence of boreal fluid  the songbirds of the yard were about to be contaminated by a new age concert  with so little at stake they praised positive thinking

 i my life is the gardener of my body the braina hothouse closed tight with its flowers and plants alien and odd in their sensitivity their terror of becoming extinct the facea formal french garden of symmetrical contours and circular paths of marble with statues and places to rest places to touch and smell to look out from to lose yourself in a green maze and keep off and don’t pick the flowers the upper body above the navelan english park pretending to be free no angles no paving stones naturelike humanlike in our image after our likeness its arms linking up with the big night all around and my lower body beneath the navelsometimes a nature preserve wild frightening amazing an unpreserved preserve and sometimes a japanese garden concentrated full of forethought and the penis and testes are smooth polished stones with dark vegetation between them precise paths fraught with meaning and calm reflection and the teachings of my father and the commandments of my mother are birds of chirp and song and the woman i love is seasons and changing weather and the children at play are my children and the life my life  2 i’ve never been in those places where i’ve never been and never will be i have no share in the infinity of lightyears and darkyears but the darkness is mine and the light and my time is my own the sand on the seashorethose infinite grains are the same sand where i made love in achziv and caesarea the years of my life i have broken into hours and the hours into minutes and seconds and fractions of seconds these only these are the stars above me that cannot be numbered  3 and what is my life span i’m like a man gone out of egypt the red sea parts i cross on dry land two walls of water on my right hand and on my left pharaoh’s army and his horsemen behind me before me the desert perhaps the promised land too that is my life span  4 open closed open before we are born everything is open in the universe without us for as long as we live everything is closed within us and when we die everything is open again open closed open that’s all we are  5 what then is my life span like shooting a selfportrait i set up the camera a few feet away on something stable the one thing that’s stable in this world i decide on a good place to stand near a tree run back to the camera press the timer run back again to that place near the tree and i hear the ticking of time the whirring like a distant prayer the click of the shutter like an execution that is my life span god develops the picture in his big darkroom and here is the picture white hair on my head eyes tired and heavy eyebrows black like the charred lintels above the windows in a house that burned down my life span is over  6 i wasn’t one of the six million who died in the shoah i wasn’t even among the survivors and i wasn’t one of the six hundred thousand who went out of egypt i came to the promised land by sea no i was not in that number though i still have the fire and the smoke within me pillars of fire and pillars of smoke that guide me by night and by day i still have inside me the mad search for emergency exits for soft places for the nakedness of the land for the escape into weakness and hope i still have within me the lust to search for living water with quiet talk to the rock or with frenzied blows afterwards silence no questions no answers jewish history and world history grind me between them like two grindstones sometimes to a powder and the solar year and the lunar year get ahead of each other or fall behind leaping they set my life in perpetual motion sometimes i fall into the gap between them to hide or to sink all the way down  7 i believe with perfect faith that at this very moment millions of human beings are standing at crossroads and intersections in jungles and deserts showing each other where to turn what the right way is which direction they explain exactly where to go what is the quickest way to get there when to stop and ask again there over there the second turnoff not the first and from there left or right near the white house by the oak tree they explain with excited voices with a wave of the hand and a nod of the head there over there not that there the other there as in some ancient rite this too is a new religion i believe with perfect faith that at this very moment

 he described her mouth as full of ashes so when he kissed her finally he was thinking about ashes  and the blacker rim just below the edge of the ashtray and the faint dark rim that outlined her lips  and the lips themselves at the limit of another darkness farther and far more interior  then the way the red paling just outside those lines caught fire and the pages caught  soon after that slowly at first but then all at once at the scalloped brown corners of each  like the ruff of an offended and darkening bird extended then folded in on itself multiple  stiffening gone

 the city had such pretty clotheslines women aired their intimate apparel  in the emery haze membranes of lingerie pearl ruby copper slips their somehow intestinal quivering in the wind  and freihofer’s spread the chaste apron scent of baking a sensual net over a few yards of north troy  the city had niagara mohawk bearing down with power and light and members of the local shifting on the line  they worked on fabrics made from wood and acid synthetics that won’t vent  they pieced the tropics into housecoats when big prints were the rage dacron gardens twisted on the line over lots of queen anne’s lace sackdresses dyed the sun as sun passed through making a brash stained glass against the leading of the tenements  the warehouse holding medical supplies i waited for my bus by that window of trusses in caucasian beige trying to forget the pathological inside i was thinking of being alive  i was waiting to open the amber envelopes of mail at home just as food service workers counter women maybe my aunt fran waited to undo their perms from the delicate insect meshes required by the board of health  aunt alice wasn’t on this route she made brushes and plastics at tek hughes milk crates of orange industrial lace the cartons could drip through  once we boarded the girls from behrmanning put their veins up and sawed their nails to dust on files from the plant all day they made abrasives garnet paper yes and rags covered with crushed gems called garnet cloth  it was duskwhen aunts and mothers formed their larval curls and wrapped their heads in thick brown webs  it was yesterdaytwenty years after my father’s death i found something he had kept a packet of lightning  cut sanding discs still sealed i guess he meant to open the finish strip the paint stalled on some grain and groom the primal gold  the discs are the rough size of those cookies the franchises call homestyle and label best before  the old cellophane was tough but i ripped until i touched  their harsh done crust

 1  i made myself mommy and daddy were proud in that order i didn’t mail myself like a letter some other kids already knew i learned to use stamps they stuck to my thumb without any glue i didn’t have any permission  2  there was a snowstorm that lasted three days and a cavern of monochrome memory there were board games and a pencilandpaper game where the object was to figure out the object of the game there was a stack of broadrule writing paper and a stapled calendar and a 64pack of sparkly rainbow crayons to make each week look different since they all started out black and white and all the same  3  o grapefruit as color and flavor o never quite rightly tied laces o look up there on the uneven climbing bars too hot to touch where the sun touches now that it’s spring  the shadow of a tarp like a sail between sailors and thin swings that make no decision like weathervanes  o think of the lost chuck taylors the lost mary janes

 noon march 6 1997 from morning’s mouth the bones emerge a prayer is whispered over rounded horns the prairie is beyond the quivering hump and holy smoke sparkles released in the breath braided sweetgrass be about their hooves although the grip of hunger lies heavy on the land let endless native grasses grow among the yellow stones and between the stars even if only one man had begun to sing actually it was thousands she who came to wisconsin farmers and transformed their lives she who brought her blessing in the form of being newborn she whom they named the miracle white buffalo calf maiden must return amid the fast firing of bullets along the most perilous of paths rock stars millionaires they all offered millions of dollars to struggling white farmers but she had begun her transformation and her prophecy by touching them and they came to understand if not the actual words to the prayers at least the reverence the need to protect to keep the doors open like it was a hundred years ago bounties are gathered from death trains buses cars planes carry the segmented body of the terrible worm across the land and the screams of the hunted split the sun awake it is time to restore the stolen beads and shards the bones and knives to every grave and the graves are graves no longer but wombs the bounties burn their hands and bones come flowing from museum shelves to dance in the rippling grass rebuilding lungs starting hearts there must be a hundred men and a hundred men’s worth of heartlessness wished they could find indians to kill but now that is illegal so they make up some excuse to raise their rifles and take aim not hearing the rumble of buffalo prayer not feeling tomorrow tremble or the prophecy of miracle and smile as they see the legs give way the horns gouge open the prairie ground earth betrayed again

 we were apart yet day by day i bade my heart more constant be i bade it keep the world away and grow a home for only thee nor feard but thy love likewise grew like mine each day more tried more true  the fault was grave i might have known what far too soon alas i learnd the heart can bind itself alone and faith may oft be unreturnd selfswayd our feelings ebb and swell thou lovst no morefarewell farewell  farewelland thou thou lonely heart which never yet without remorse even for a moment didst depart from thy remote and sphered course to haunt the place where passions reign back to thy solitude again  back with the conscious thrill of shame which luna felt that summernight flash through her pure immortal frame when she forsook the starry height to hang over endymions sleep upon the pinegrown latmian steep  yet she chaste queen had never proved how vain a thing is mortal love wandering in heaven far removed but thou hast long had place to prove this truthto prove and make thine own thou hast been shalt be art alone  or if not quite alone yet they which touch thee are unmating things ocean and clouds and night and day lorn autumns and triumphant springs and life and others joy and pain and love if love of happier men  of happier menfor they at least have dreamd two human hearts might blend in one and were through faith released from isolation without end prolongd nor knew although not less alone than thou their loneliness

 word of it comes whispered by a slippery thin section of the paper where the models pantomime unruffled têteàtêtes despite the absence of their blouses  each year when my familiar latches on them so intently like a grand master plotting the white queen’s path like a baby trying to suckle a whole roast beef  i ask what you salt block are you dreaming about being clubbed by thunderheadsbut he will not say meanwhile capricorn’s dark hours flabbed me  uneasy about surrendering to the expert fitter even if the cupped hands were licensed and bonded i had august in mind seeing the pygmy goats at the county fair  now the sky is having its daily rain event and the trees are having their hibernal bark event pretending they feel unruffled  despite the absence of their leaves and we forget how they looked all flouncy and green instead we regard fearfully the sway of their old trunks

 excerpt i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heapd from evershifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds such as from earths embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited seaside which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes broken and unrepaird and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down this ride was my delight i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a rememberd friend i love to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare strippd to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth harmonizing with solitude and sent into our hearts aëreal merriment so as we rode we talkd and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingerd not but flew from brain to brainsuch glee was ours chargd with light memories of rememberd hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argud against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side the sense that he was greater than his kind had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light meanwhile the sun pausd ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountainsoh how beautiful is sunset when the glow of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then just where we had dismounted the counts men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood which lay between the city and the shore pavd with the image of the sky the hoar and aëry alps towards the north appeard through mist an heavensustaining bulwark reard between the east and west and half the sky was roofd with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet pausd in his descent among the manyfolded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peakèd isles and thenas if the earth and sea had been dissolvd into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent ere it fade said my companion i will show you soon a better stationso oer the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leand and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evenings gleam its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment pild to heaven i was about to speak whenwe are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell i lookd and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile a windowless deformd and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayd and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolld in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied o ho you talk as in years past said maddalo  tis strange men change not you were ever still among christs flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambsif you cant swim beware of providence i lookd on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye and such he cried is our mortality and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heavenillumind tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below round the rent heart and prayas madmen do for what they know nottill the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled i recall the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower lookd gray and all between the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloominto the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyd me to my lodgings by the way  the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i calld on him and whilst i waited with his child i playd a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyesoh speak not of her eyeswhich seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me she was a special favourite i had nursd her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemd to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changd than she was by six months or so for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count enterd salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spiritif man be the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws though i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faiththus much i spoke and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night it is our will that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind and if we were not weak should we be less in deed than in desire ay if we were not weakand we aspire how vainly to be strong said maddalo you talk utopia it remains to know i then rejoind and those who try may find how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw we are assurd much may be conquerd much may be endurd of what degrades and crushes us we know that we have power over ourselves to do and sufferwhat we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reignd before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind yet feel their faith religion my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutationtight as far as words go i knew one like you who to this city came some months ago with whom i argud in this sort and he is now gone madand so he answerd me poor fellow but if you would like to go well visit him and his wild talk will show how vain are such aspiring theories i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowd his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be belovd with gentleness and being scornd what wonder if they die some living death this is not destiny but mans own wilful ill  as thus i spoke servants announcd the gondola and we through the fastfalling rain and highwrought sea saild to the island where the madhouse stands

 it’s up and away from our work today for the breeze sweeps over the down and it’s hey for a game where the gorse blossoms flame and the bracken is bronzing to brown with the turf ’neath our tread and the blue overhead and the song of the lark in the whin there’s the flag and the green with the bunkers between now will you be over or in  the doctor may come and we’ll teach him to know a tee where no tannin can lurk the soldier may come and we’ll promise to show some hazards a soldier may shirk the statesman may joke as he tops every stroke that at last he is high in his aims and the clubman will stand with a club in his hand that is worth every club in st james’  the palm and the leather come rarely together gripping the driver’s haft and it’s good to feel the jar of the steel and the spring of the hickory shaft why trouble or seek for the praise of a clique a cleek here is common to all and the lie that might sting is a very small thing when compared with the lie of the ball  come youth and come age from the study or stage from bar or from benchhigh and low a green you must use as a cure for the blues you drive them away as you go we’re outward bound on a long long round and it’s time to be up and away if worry and sorrow come back with the morrow at least we’ll be happy today

 let us consider the farmer who makes his straw hat his sweetheart or the old woman who makes a floor lamp her son or the young woman who has set herself the task of scraping her shadow off a wall  let us consider the old woman who wore smoked cows’ tongues for shoes and walked a meadow gathering cow chips in her apron or a mirror grown dark with age that was given to a blind man who spent his nights looking into it which saddened his mother that her son should be so lost in vanity  let us consider the man who fried roses for his dinner whose kitchen smelled like a burning rose garden or the man who disguised himself as a moth and ate his overcoat and for dessert served himself a chilled fedora

 the dogs barked the dogs scratched the dogs got wet the dogs shook the dogs circled the dogs slept the dogs ate the dogs barked the rain fell down the leaves fell down the eggs fell down and cracked on the floor the dust settled the wood floors were scratched the cabinets sat without doors the trim without paint the stuff piled up i loaded the dishwasher i unloaded the dishwasher i raked the leaves i did the laundry i took out the garbage i took out the recycling i took out the yard waste  there was a bed it was soft there was a blanket it was warm there were dreams they were good the corn grew the eggplant grew the tomatoes grew the lettuce grew the strawberries grew the blackberries grew the tea kettle screamed the computer keys clicked the radio roared the tv spoke “will they ever come home” “can’t i take a break” “how do others keep their house clean” “will i remember this day in fifty years” the sweet tea slipped down my throat the brownies melted in my mouth my mother cooked the apple tree bloomed the lilac bloomed the mimosa bloomed i bloomed

 one of the objects ive treasured most in my life is this letter scale which long ago you gave me i was an active correspondent at the time even sending lots of letters overseas while still enjoying the pleasure of going to the post i now had another assessing exactly in advance at my counter the cost of packets and envelopes to which price list in hand i stuck my stamps i use it less these days this quite simple device graded with little marks up to a whole pound for my mailings rarely still exceed the price of an ordinary stamp the tray of polished metals now covered with dust without the slightest hint that the red pointer marking the weight on the front has budged but in the long run one would i think discern a difference and see how much the months were worth in terms of dust the seasons elapsed since the previous weighing but having been seized suddenly just this morning by a tremendous attack annual of cleaning from which nothing is released i restored to the trays slightly concave stainless steel that ever so slightly distorted mirror its polished shine it reflected all of the sky through which clouds reeled and i could confirm that space does not weigh more than time

 wedged in the top branches rain still sighing to earth as a dissolute sky dissolves a mozambican woman turns mother her water breaking loose to pool with the flood  licking the trunk below a countrysized puddle calls forth the child whose name the mother vowed would not be drowned no matter how high she had to climb my mother’s water  washed her bare yellow bathroom tile many years ago a diluvial warning of my struggle to arrive we fought to get me out and have been tugging at each  other ever since tethered by a cord that simply thickens when it’s cut we descended then thirsting churning not into the waters that hound the mozambican  mother baying her and her baby in the tree but into that enduring ocean in which  as mother daughter or both  a woman’s only choices are drink or swim

 the white clothes on the line put the man to sleep he was sitting on a soda case leaning back on the porch  he rolled down his sleeves with his eyes shut he could feel the sun going into the trees  he wanted to catch the evening ferry and meet someone across the river  he dreamed about her putting polish on her nails he was in the woods and many women were walking around him in a circle he thought about crosses in their blood  as it got to be night he could feel the heat in his face he was going to open his eyes and look up at the moon it was like the light blue handkerchief she gave him to go with his dark suit  that’s when he felt the hot salt all over him like broken glass he was afraid to open his eyes he wondered if he could use any words on it but the big woman in the black dress was already in the backseat of the car rolling the window up with one hand and making a sign on him with the other  she was in the car too he saw her biting her nails when they pulled away  there was a dead snake on his shoes he knew there would be a circle of little beating hearts in his bed and before he could get home they would be dry and still

 all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame  oft in my waking dreams do i live oer again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the ruined tower  the moonshine stealing oer the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve  she leant against the armed man the statue of the armed knight she stood and listened to my lay amid the lingering light  few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best wheneer i sing the songs that make her grieve  i played a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story an old rude song that suited well that ruin wild and hoary  she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not choose but gaze upon her face  i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land  i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading tone with which i sang anothers love interpreted my own  she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i gazed too fondly on her face  but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he crossed the mountainwoods nor rested day nor night  that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade  there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight  and that unknowing what he did he leaped amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land  and how she wept and clasped his knees and how she tended him in vain and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain  and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forestleaves a dying man he lay  his dying wordsbut when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity  all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve  and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and cherished long  she wept with pity and delight she blushed with love and virginshame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name  her bosom heavedshe stepped aside as conscious of my look she stepped then suddenly with timorous eye she fled to me and wept  she half enclosed me with her arms she pressed me with a meek embrace and bending back her head looked up and gazed upon my face  twas partly love and partly fear and partly twas a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart  i calmed her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride

 under the separated leaves of shade of the gingko that old tree that has existed essentially unchanged longer than any other living tree i walk behind a woman her hairs coarse gold is spun from the sunlight that it rides upon women were paid to knit from sweet champagne her second skin it winds and unwinds winds up her long legs delectable haunches as she sways in sunlight up the gazing aisle the shade of the tree that is called maidenhair that is not positively known to exist in a wild state spots her fair or almost fair hair twisted in a french twist tall or almost tall she walks through the air the rain has washed a clear thing moving easily on its high heels seeming to men miraculous    since i can call her as swann couldnt a woman who is my type i follow with the warmth of familiarity of novelty this new example of the type reminded of how lorenzs justhatched goslings shook off the last remnants of the egg and looking at lorenz realized that lorenz was their mother quaking his little family followed him everywhere and when they met a goose their mother they ran to him afraid  imprinted upon me is the shape i run to the sweet strange breathtaking contours that breathe to me i am yours be mine following this new body somehow familiar this young shape somehow old for a moment im younger the century is younger the living strauss his moustache just getting gray is shouting to the players louder louder i can still hear madame schumannheink or else white bald the old mans joyfully telling conductors they must play elektra like a midsummer nights dreamlike a fairy music proust dying is swallowing his iced beer and changing in proof the death of bergotte according to his own experience garbo a commissar in paris is listening attentively to the voice telling how mcgillicuddy me mcgillivray and mcgillivray said to mcgillicuddyno mcgillicuddy said to mcgillivraythat is mcgillivraygarbo says seriously i vish deyd never met  as i walk behind this woman i remember that before i flew herewaked in the forest at dawn by the piece called birds beginning day that each day birds play to begin the day i wished as men wish may this day be different the birds were wishing as birds wishover and over with a last firmness intensity reality may this day be the same ah turn to me and look into my eyes say i am yours be mine my wish will have come true and yet when your eyes meet my eyes theyll bring into the weightlessness of my pure wish the weight of a human being someone to help or hurt someone to be good to me to be good to someone to cry when i am angry that she doesnt like elektra someone to start on proust with a wish come true is life i have my life when you turn just slide your eyes across my eyes and show in a look flickering across your face as lightly as a leafs shade a birds wing that there is no one in the world quite like me that if onlyif only that will be enough  but ive pretended long enough i walk faster and come close touch with the tip of my finger the nape of her neck just where the gold hair stops and the champagnecolored dress begins my finger touches her as the gingkos shadow touches her because after all it is my wife in a new dress from bergdorfs walking toward the park she cries out we kiss each other and walk arm in arm through the sunlight thats much too good for new york the sunlight of our own house in the forest still though the poor things need itweve no need to start out on proust to ask each other about strauss we first helped each other hurt each other years ago after so many changes made and joys repeated our first bewildered transcending recognition is pure acceptance   we cant tell our life from our wish really i began the day not with a mans wish may this day be different but with the birds wish may this day be the same day the day of my life

 the old russian spits up a plum fruit of the rasping sound he has stored in his throat all these lonely years  made in fact lonely by his wife who left him god knows without knowing how to cook for himself  he examines the plum notes its purplish consistency almost the color and shape of her buttocks whose circulation was bad  which is why he himself wears a beret black good wool certainly warm enough the times he remembers  he shoots the plum to the ground like a child whose confidence is a game of marbles  whose flick of a thumb is a smile inside his mouth knowing what he knows will happen  but his wife marthe does not spill out when the plum breaks open  instead it is a younger self alive and waving just the size he remembers himself to have been  the old russian puts him onto his finger like a parakeet and sits him on the shelf with the pictures  for the rest of his days he nags himself constantly into a halfsleep surprised by this turn of events

 when your man comes home from prison when he comes back like the wound and you are the stitch when he comes back with pennies in his pocket and prayer fresh on his lips you got to wash him down first  you got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled and calmed waiting for his skin like a shining baptism back into what he was before gun barrels and bars chewed their claim in his hide and spit him stumbling backwards into screaming sunlight  you got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears from ashy skin lather down the cuffmarks from ankle and wrist rinse solitary’s stench loose from his hair scrape curse and confession from the welted and the smooth the hard and the soft the furrowed and the lax  you got to hold tight that shadrach’s face between your palms take crease and lid and lip and brow and rinse slow with river water and when he opens his eyes you tell him calm and sure how a woman birthed him back whole again

 “who are you to tell us how to live or why et cetera”   no man of course and not so tall as is the current fashion nor smart enough in the acceptable modern way to enthrall  the crowd with stories of my life among the savages where i was home and growing baffled day by day raging through the night as if it were new music i made groaing  it came to me today at lunch the sound of women in the next booth a voice like aunt odile’swhom i never knew well nor did i like her but not her spite  but her voice like homegrown fame a touch gravelly a considerable groan itself it seemed they spoke outmoded french around me never to me except to taunt i thought   she leaned  above me on those visits speaking to mother in their private french laughing   a boy surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues knowing what wasn’t meant for him   toy  temptations suggestive coils of syllables i learned latin for mass and did love its terrific laddered randomness the blessed hovering virgin above  every station of a boy’s new path hormonal disharmonies her praises sung into hundreds the first tuesday of every month and yet latin could not expose such shreds  of glittering flesh as i found in french not like the living tongue whose tip twined into an uncle’s mustache as he leered at the wrong aunt and winked and a fine  distance crystallized loud there then gone crashing like german father’s family spoke clear english among the bayous boys and girls of immigrants accentless happily  german through two wars not counting civil   i had the tongue for arithmetic and spoke it beautifully   i loved to count precision’s a tempting career clicking  into a future like an abacus ignoring all those accents around i never learned the luck of any but english bland and bound  but only yesterday i heard a word the mechanic said in czech to his cousinshop ragclearly centered in a welter of incomprehension the wreck  of my car at their wretched mercies   shop rag   and he wiped his hands and cried for me shrugging like a cousin would i wrote a check i drove home or tried  so does it count   am i a man of passion or child of comprehension   “father of little lusts driving myself home who thinks   buy some sentiment a little like love and she must  speak french this time she longs for you you know it isn’t just the money america loves you for yourself alone” and so i go for professional help honey  blond hair and a disposition like a happy banker whose french for dear sounds like dog the cost of living is going up loving her here

 all thats left is the shroud the back wings roaches scurrying in the kitchen there’s no greater threat than this time at hand drunken cackles from the street still damp from 4 am rain i missed the instructions for this part the trap the deflate of dream utopia was always supposed to be right at hand right and left any which way we’d make of it   marine layer won’t budge for the rumble under our feet sky tears open in the north sirens on high a small pool forms in the buckle of asphalt in its gentle tremble the reflection of the grey white mass overhead with a perfect seam of blue the rift where the dead speak howtos

 the day ended badly with a broken ankle a jinxed printer and a dead car the dry yellow grass against the sunset saved me roosters  pranced across a lawn of shit proudly plumed in black feathers bobbing before the gray goats it was the first day i saw god in the quiet  and found a mustard seed was very small there i had been for years cursing “why” and all the gold in the sun fell upon me  there was a white mare in the midst of brown smog majestic in the refinery clouds even the radio wouldn’t work  my mother limps and her hair falls out the faithful drive white chevy trucks or yellow camrys and i’m here golden  on the smoking shockless bus i lost language in this want each poem dust spanish fluttered  as music across the desert even weeds tumbled unloved the police sirens seared the coming night dogs howled helplessly sad  lo i walk the valley of death love lingers in my hard eyes mañana never comes just right i mend myself in the folds  of paper songs ring my paper bells for empty successquiero nada if i sing long enough i’ll grow dreamlike and find a flock of pigeons white under wings lifting awkward bodies like doves across the silky bluewhite sky

 on nights like this we used to swim in the quarry the boys making up games requiring them to tear off  the girls’ clothes and the girls cooperating because they had new bodies since last summer and they wanted to exhibit them the brave ones leaping off  the high rocks  bodies crowding the water  the nights were humid still the stone was cool and wet marble for  graveyards for buildings that we never saw buildings in cities far away  on cloudy nights you were blind those nights the rocks were dangerous but in another way it was all dangerous that was what we were after the summer started then the boys and girls began to pair off but always there were a few left at the end  sometimes they’d keep watch sometimes they’d pretend to go off  with each other like the rest but what could they do there in the woods no one wanted to be them but they’d show up anyway as though some night their luck would change fate would be a different fate  at the beginning and at the end though we were all together after the evening chores after the smaller children were in bed then we were free nobody said anything but we knew the nights we’d meet and the nights we wouldn’t once or twice at the end of summer we could see a baby was going to come out of all that kissing  and for those two it was terrible as terrible as being alone the game was over we’d sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes worrying about the ones who weren’t there  and then finally walk home through the fields because there was always work the next day and the next day we were kids again sitting on the front steps in the morning eating a peach  just that but it seemed an honor to have a mouth and then going to work which meant helping out in the fields one boy worked for an old lady building shelves the house was very old maybe built when the mountain was built  and then the day faded we were dreaming waiting for night standing at the front door at twilight watching the shadows lengthen and a voice in the kitchen was always complaining about the heat wanting the heat to break  then the heat broke the night was clear and you thought of  the boy or girl you’d be meeting later and you thought of  walking into the woods and lying down practicing all those things you were learning in the water and though sometimes you couldn’t see the person you were with there was no substitute for that person  the summer night glowed in the field fireflies were glinting and for those who understood such things the stars were sending messages you will leave the village where you were born and in another country you’ll become very rich very powerful but always you will mourn something you left behind even though you can’t say what it was and eventually you will return to seek it

 at dusk a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay waves were broken scrolls          beyond donegal white mountains hung in a narrow basrelief frozen on sky  later there was sleet trees down on the drumholm road near timoney’s farm a frantic goose pinned under branches  all night long we spoke of loneliness long winter while winter sang in the chimneys  then the sky cleared and a marvel began the hills turned blue in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke it gathered like a dream drenched in frost  that should have been all                           we had worn out night  but singlefile  deliberate  five heifers  a black bull  three calves stepped  through the broken fence they arranged themselves between the house and hedge a kind of diagram a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds  their image is with me still               the backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as morning

 for michael williams monaco was clean with small clean streets there was not much in the way of  a shore there was hardly any place to go one clipped wellbehaved london plane tree not welcoming like most ordinary trees was kept apart by a white speartipped fence and had a somewhat diffident sense of  noblesse oblige through the cream silk brocade window treatments you could see it it did not contain birds repelled the idea of  nests its roots trained and snipped at night it was lit spritzed its leaves shimmered like the sequins of a whore in the palace hung a portrait of   princess grace’s family an extravaganza of pastel sfumato by rw cowan blurring every uncertain authentic thing the air inside the cliffs thickened as in the closet of a grandmother perfumed germans winced smooching with strong lips on the embankment  when the man and woman arrived at the hôtel de paris the staff assumed they  were married the german  jet ski instructor was unsure and asked “are you brother and sister” they paused demurely and smiled the mystery of  their bond made it more intense the man and the woman were in their late thirties or early forties they were not young nor were they old  the woman was french and wore a white linen shirt starched and pressed she made her money in the drug trade but all the man knew was that she sold works of art a matisse here a picasso there  each transaction taking place in the bahamas she was what she said she was but we are rarely what we say we are the man a poor american meant to say no but instead said yes he was tall athletic and effeminate with a mincing gate  as if  he were being chased by something no one could see dressed in cashmere and shantung he wore needlepointed shoes by stubbs amp wootton broadshouldered practical the frenchwoman grimaced was referred to as “handsome” ample were her gestures ample her need to please her tone although not sexual came close her preferences were dubious maybe everyone’s are  nevertheless the couple exhibited variations the world never embraced but presented as a couple the world embraced them promptly for the world trusted what was coupled he was he she was she both were naive but naivety has a way of  hiding its intentions whatever their motives happened to be it pleased them to make a myth for everyone to see promises were skirted at a little cafe  “what shall we name our childrenmon petit chéri” she asked how controlled their wonder was  the couple was received for cakes and tea by the baroness von lindenhoffer the baroness was lesbian but of this she never spoke and so she believed herself a conundrum  for her muteness banished the undoable she often began her conversations by mentioning her brief marriage to a hairy russian acrobat her makeup was heavy clownlike and over her large illdefined body red polka dots sheeted her parts despite this people mistook her for a man on a chintz loveseat each hip bookended by a pug she sat and said “you seem like a lovely couple” she meant what she said but she didn’t say what she meant  then there was talk of  places they had traveled and feelings of superiority at having seen what others had not “oh you haven’t been there” and “oh you must go” through the large picture window beyond the baroness’s head piled high with hair dyed red slowly processed gargantuan cruise ships like wedding cakes with glittering tiers of candles she inserted another biscotti behind her lips which were the size of   luggage handles winked and said “here in monaco our favorite word is more” her eyes scanned the clutter of the côte d’azur the sea published its gilded mirrors the sun accelerated beauty and its loss no children for miles and brigitte bardot in st tropez locked her house cats licking her purpleveined ankles  the baroness was thinking pausing like an old steamer her mascaraclotted eyelids closed and for a moment she erased what she could with mounting unease she realized she might be what was missing the thought vanished should she warn the couple although not feminine she was maternal then that thought passed she shrugged and comforted herself difficult celibate implacable a final time she assessed the couple of compromised want aware that nothing blackens the heart like a mariage blanc and stamped them mwah mwah with the imprimatur of  two kisses each  the relationship lasted three months they had chosen wrongly and plausibly they fell apart like the couple in godard’s le mépris had she wanted more than a cover had he covered more than he wanted the heart behind its casements is faceted pronged coveted intricate and known by few he could not be kept she withdrew her money reconciliation occurred after they ceased speaking on their last night in monaco she turned to him and wondered if  her life had meant anything he did not answer he had developed a grace for offering himself  to those who found truth difficult when they left the restaurant she paid using a heavy black american express card each took a doggy bag and smelled of cooked meat this alignment of opposite sexes had provided solace and for a time each had assumed a place discerned a way to live  indeed they lived on never to see each other again both aware the one had harmed the other whether intended or not the act could not be undone what they recalled when they recalled was often wrong or was it that so much went wrong and that was why they kept recalling at the mention of   monaco they recounted certain adornments  agapanthus purpling old men playing boules and blue yachts tilting on a malachite sea or were they malachite yachts tilting on a blue sea wherever they went henceforth  the hôtel du cap the boboli gardens or even simple small places in america  their minds would inexorably turn and then return to that interval in monaco where they saw the truth and the truth was     monaco monaco  frivolous ridiculous miniscule principality it was there they came to know how dangerous beauty could be how one could disappear into it and with that dark knowledge they traveled on each in their separate lives always mentioned monaco with deference out of shyness yes but also shame and that need to abridge the past do you recognize them they were not a couple but they were a pair  tonight the sea pushes against monaco jewelry store owners don white gloves lock their doors the principality has long forgotten the pair baronesses marchionesses and princesses have had their portraits painted and affixed to walls the narrow deadend streets embed themselves into the escarpments like bobby pins the moon spreads her cape of   baubles across the sea with glamorous transience enlarging behind the dollhouse casino banks hotels feeling into the rooms fingering the miniatures

 some years ago a procession of men calling themselves the skyclad came to this district to build a hospital for birds that had been damaged by the rains  the landholders here my grandfather among them decided against it it not being our way to intervene with monsoons  which is why to this day the birds here grow so damaged amp wise  or so our tutor said gravely  before stepping out into the sun washed coriander patch to watch droplets work down stems one by one small storms suspended while over the rooftiles came breakers of mist making our whole house to him drift back like the high prow of the viceroy’s steamship he watched sail off with his youth  inside i still could not find the main verb the chariot wheel performed i thought  it was silver it bore  the king with 100 heads across a battlefield red with his wounded up to the end of the beginner’s workbook  then blueskinned rama bent his bow then his raider’s arrow met the axle amp then  i could not stop laughing  as through the doorway my mother scolded the aphasic houseboy  who peed into our green watertank black putti untouchable arcing the thin golden stream amp singing oooee oooee at our ruin

 everything about the young foreign taxidermist was overdone did he absolutely have to wear the apron with the tiny red castles in the shop or weave at night in and out of the trees i don’t think so i would bring him buckets of ice water day after day hoping he would just cool off a bit fact is he never did but to be fair he really was practicing what the papers called “heroic medicine” it was love i admit it it was fancy love i was the envy of the world being hitched up with such a genius and that felt good of course these days i can’t touch rope or a small child without thinking of him without expecting his large hands to come out of nowhere we were as mother said both “slowly losing our minds” he’d talk for hours about hygiene the water cure for example and wrote an awardwinning essay on the electric bath as a way to treat hysteria in the female fox “too many foxes” he would say shaking his fist “too many foxes running around like chickens with their heads cut off” in the winter months we would ride our bicycles down to the scrapmetal yard where he would make love to me in devout silence the delight in his eyes when he found that small cage he was both tender and rough and i had never and will never again be as touched by another man i didn’t notice the black mustache growing slowly but unmercifully on his left shoulder until two or three years into the affair at first it seemed harmless a small patch of dead grass but eventually i couldn’t help but only see the large dark field its silent twitching by then it was already early fall and the fact is it tore us apart

 from the high terrace porch i watch the dawn no light appears though dark has mostly gone sunk from the cold and monstrous stone the hills lie naked but not light the darkness spills down the remoter gulleys pooled will stay too low to melt not yet alive with day below the windows the lawn matted deep under its closecropped tips with dewy sleep gives off a faint hush all its plushy swarm alive with coolness reaching to be warm gray windows at my back the massy frame dull with the blackness that has not a name but down below the garden is still young of five years’ growth perhaps and terracehung drop by slow drop of seeping concrete walls such are the bastions of our pastorals  here are no palms they once lined country ways where old white houses glared down dusty days with small round towers bluntheaded through small trees those towers are now the hiving place of bees the palms were coarse their leaves hung thick with dust the roads were muffled deep but now deep rust has fastened on the wheels that labored then peace to all such and to all sleeping men i lived my childhood there a passive dream in the expanse of that recessive scheme  slow air slow fire o deep delay of time that summer crater smoked like slaking lime the hills so dry so dense the underbrush that where i pushed my way the giant hush was changed to soft explosion as the sage broke down to powdered ash the sift of age and fell along my path a shadowy rift  on these rocks now no burning ashes drift mowed lawn has crept along the granite bench the yellow blossoms of acacia drench the dawn with pollen and with waxen green the long leaves of the eucalypti screen the closer hills from viewlithe tall and fine and nobly clad with youth they bend and shine the small dark pool jutting with living rock trembles at every atmospheric shock blurred to its depth with the cold living ooze from cloudy caves heavy with summer dews the shyest and most tremulous beings stir the pulsing of their fins a lucent blur that like illusion glances off the view the pulsing mouths like metronomes are true  this is my father’s house no homestead here that i shall live in but a shining sphere of glass and glassy moments frail surprise my father’s phantasy of paradise which melts upon his death which he attained with loss of heart for every step he gained too firmly gentle to displace the great he crystallized this vision somewhat late forbidden now to climb the garden stair he views the terrace from a window chair his friends hard shaken by some twenty years tremble with palsy and with senile fears in their late middle age gone cold and gray fine men now broken that the vision stay they spend astutely their depleted breath with tired ironic faces wait for death  below the garden the hills fold away deep in the valley a mist fine as spray ready to shatter into spinning light conceals the city at the edge of night the city on the tremendous valley floor draws its dream deeper for an instant more superb on solid loam and breathing deep poised for a moment at the edge of sleep  cement roads mark the hills wide bending free of cliff and headland dropping toward the sea through suburb after suburb vast ravines swell to the summer drone of fine machines the driver melting down the distance here may cast in flight the faint hoof of a deer or pass the faint head set perplexedly and manmade stone outgrows the living tree and at its rising air is shaken men are shattered and the tremor swells again extending to the naked salty shore rank with the sea which crumbles evermore

 there were no road rails i remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffs we motored along i remember speed in a parched chevy clunker that could not have sped and bench seats and no buckles and bare thighs peeling off faux leather at every hairpin every elevated canyon mile was a feat but a breath of less slickened air too less cog and fume  a winding away from the wavering sealeg steam off blinding sidewalks infinite sidewalks and other shoeless kids kicking rusted palm leaves outside infinite apartment complexes away from our corner of the valley of concrete corners of no evidence of valley besides boulders stacked in the distance of every vista  the driver was a stranger was my mother after my whole life had passed with stranger after stranger was my mother after seven years and me at seven years with her driving that snuffcolored nova from her blinding valley not a valley  through laurel topanga malibu canyons all the way to some fantastic to her beloved blue  eucalyptus choking local growth the whole trek and the cooling air as we  efforted west and the jolt of a castlethe castle in a distant crook of a range that hid the slate of the ocean  made me want to stop moving but not stop here i remember hoping to find hermit crabs the size of the mole on my right side chin and if i tethered them to a stick they’d line up by mass and trade shells find homes that fit and there’d be one left without one torn out a book said a scientist leaned into wet sand watched a torn crab die in the beak of a gull i can’t remember if i saw that death or read it  i remember  watching a wrong castle tucked into a wrong mountain notch on the chin of the sky like the hermit mole on my chin if my face were the sky “it’s a beauty mark” my mother had said “don’t pick at it” i eyed that smoking stranger at the wheel and dug my nail in as the pacific swelled into view that first time

 1 the candle will be our medium for dialogue we must always be on speaking terms 2 when you see the candle by the bedside burning it will be my message to you do not touch 3 you will heal through herbs amp the words i give you to spray unto the solution 4 never dress in black i may mistake you for someone ready to die 5 as much as possible do not speak wickedly or damn anyone 6 as much as possible stay away from funerals i like to work alone death is death’s work iku n’iku che 7 egun will be my messenger 8 you may also petition me through that white staff you know the one with bells amp snail shells you also know the chant 9 do not be tempted by possessions amp titles if you have patience i will make possible those you actually will need 10 remember this pact amp i will give you health amp long life aiku  all this was negotiated just prior to his birth he probably kneeled before the owner of the sky while iku his patron orisha and many egun sat watching with fly whisks in hand and full regalia after all one of their own was about to embark on his journey to the human world the ilé aiyé  he probably placed in circular fashion inside a big calabash all his choices probably whispered into the gourd a slow ashé tó iba eshu we say probably because one thing is for sure el niño does not remember the details in fact no one does except the deities amp iku no one remembers the details of their creation no one remembers the destiny the mission they chose their personal orisha and most importantly the date of their last breath  memory amp continuity keeping el hilo de la conversación never losing the wavy amp fragile link that keeps you grounded to yr root the dialogue with spirits that may tap yr left shoulder amp all that but no one remembers no one remembers ésto si es trágico  in order to recall the details of what went on in the other world to map his destiny el niño must be taken for divination and even then one session won’t do it the story will get revealed as his life turns each page amp changes rhythm amp the oracle is cast several more times so they took el niño to the diviner edikáns house after pouring libations amp reciting the necessary ayuba prayersgreeting the creator the ancestors the divination earth wind river ocean jungle amp crossroad orishas edikán cast the divining chainópele used by the babalawo a picture began to emerge he said the orishas amp egun collectively called ara orun or citizens of the other world have given us certain verses amp stories to deliver messages regarding the rhythms of our lives he said el niño’s patron deity is oshun but he will always have an affinity with ogun amp obatalá but most prominent is his close relationship with egun that is the ancestors iku’s messengers he said it would be through a kinship with egun that he would accomplish his most difficult tasks even the arts of divination he will be a mouthpiece for egun  edikán said el niño has a predisposition to a vivid imagination because of this there are amp will be mysterious phenomena happening to him like visions amp dreams of secret songs he will not regard them as strange  he said el niño should be taught even at an early age the rigors of an herbalist he should be taught at least how to recognize certain trees amp plants the healing properties of the most commonly used herbs their harvesting times how they mix amp with what substances all this will eventually lead to an encyclopedic knowledge not only of their healing properties but of their ability to alter the invisible rhythms that underlie most things  edikán said there will be certain resguardos that must be prepared so as to begin bridging the gap between orishas iku egun amp himself even though el niño’s inner headori inu chose a good destiny in the other world such destiny must be aligned with his physical headori in this world it will be orishas amp egun that will focus his life amp help him fulfill the destiny he chose in the other world he said beginning with the feet el niño must be securely fastened to the earth so as to not depart too soon for the other world you see there is always the detail of iku being overprotective the relationship is like playing with a leopardeven an affectionate jab with its paw will cause a scar the head will also have to be ritually prepared amp fed with bits of white fruit among other ingredients amp thus given a firm root stability“para que su cabeza no esté en el aire” he said  we were witness to this event we heard what needed to be done there was actually a time maybe this is still going on when people consulted with the spirit world the other world on such occasions as the third month after birth we collected the ingredients that would shape his destiny amp began to assemble them much of them were from the river the jungle amp of course the cemetery we heard what needed to be done  ara orun are hip to the images amp subtle rhythms that stories amp verses evoke the same images amp subtle rhythms running through our lives edikán said that barring some details of modernity his life would follow a certain ancient story pertaining to the divination  ofun is like this ofun ni jé bé  the page continues to turnthe rhythm the rhythm will come from dreams

 “earth is the birth of the blues” sang yellow bertha as she chopped cotton beside mama rose it was as hot as any other summer day when she decided to run away folks say she made a fortune running a whorehouse in new orleans but others say she’s buried somewhere out west her grave unmarked though you can find it in the dark by the scent of jasmine and mint but i’m getting ahead of myself if it wasn’t for hell we’d all be tapdancing with the devil mama rose used to say but as it is we just stand and watch while someone else burns up before salvation “people desire damnation bertha” she said unwrapping the rag from her head to let the sweat flow down the corn rows plaited as tightly as the night coming down on the high and mighty on judgment day they say she knew what was coming because she threw some bones that morning she bent down to pick up her rag which had fallen and when she straightened up her yellow gal had gone down the road “go then” she called out “i didn’t want you no how” then she started talking to herself about how old white john caught her milking cows “he wrestled me to the ground and did his nastiness” he said “your daddy was a slave and his daddy and i’m claiming back what’s mine” it was july i remember fireworks going off outside when bertha come so white she liked to scared me to death i let her suckle my breast and i said “all right little baby maybe i’ll love you maybe” mama rose said she did her best but it’s hard to raise a gal like that with everybody thinking she’s giving them the high hat because she’s so light and got those green eyes that look right through you she frightens people even men who’re usually wanting to saddle up and ride that kind of mare can’t abide her they’re afraid if they try her they’ll never be the same the only ones willing are white they’re watching her day and night but they know john swore to kill any man who touched her because lo and behold he owns up to her he’s proud of her nobody can believe it he’s even at her baptism he buys her cheap dresses and candy at the store he hands it to her out the door because she can’t go in he won’t he won’t stop looking at her like it’s some kind of miracle she was born looking so much like him and his people it’s a warning or something “it’s evil turning back on itself” said the preacher the sunday cut clean through by the truth by the living proof as old john stood up in church and testified to the power of god who spoke to him that morning telling him he was a sinner he died that winter horrible suffering they say he had a stroke on the way to town his car ran off the road and he drowned they say bertha found him they say she ran all the way to town for the doctor who told her “i am not a colored doctor” so she went and got the sheriff he listened for a while then he locked her in a cell he said he knew she was guilty of something well after a while rose went down there and i swear she nearly had a fit “get my daughter out here” she said “how can you lock up your own brother’s child” the sheriff knew it was true so finally he said “you take her and don’t ever cross my path again” when bertha passed him on the way out he tripped her with his foot when she got off the floor she said “every dog has its day”  from that time to this is a straight line pointing at a girl who doesn’t even have shoes anymore as she runs down the road throwing off her ragged clothes as she goes until she’s as naked as the day she was born when she comes to washing hanging on the line she grabs a fine dress and keeps on running she’s crying and laughing at the same time along comes a truck that says j goody on the side the man driving stops to give her a ride he swings the door open on the passenger side but bertha says “move over i’ll drive” when she asks him why he stopped he says “i know white trash when i see it you’re just like me but youre a girl you’re pretty you can free yourself all you have to do is show a little leg and some titty in the big city” he gave her fifty cents and a wink and she started thinking she might as well turn white she got a job waiting table in a dance hall one night the boss heard her singing along with the band he said “why don’t you go up on stage” and she said “i play piano too” he said “howdy do” from then on she made everybody pay one way or another she got hard she took lovers fathers sons and husbands it didnt matter but once in a while she heard her mother’s voice saying “you made the wrong choice” and she felt the blues and she let loose with a shout “lordy” said the boss “you sound colored” more and more people came to hear her sing but they kind of feared her too they said she was too white to sing the blues like that it wasn’t right one night she got to talking with the boss he walked round and round the office shaking his head saying how much he’d lose if she stopped singing the blues “how often can you find a treasure like mine” he said laying his hand on her shoulder then he said “if i weren’t so old” and his voice dropped off to a whisper then he said “i got the answer now sweet roberta go on down to the dressing room and wait” it didnt take long he came in and set a jar on the table “what do i do with this” asked bertha he said “you’re going to pass for colored” suddenly she was wearing blackface suddenly she was safe on the other side of the door she slammed on the past and it was standing open at last she could come and go as she pleased and no one saw her enter or leave she was free she was freed but she didn’t feel it and she needed it to be real she went on though she flowed like a river carrying the body of a man who had himself a nigger because he could she lived she got old she almost froze one cold spell and she got up from her sickbed and told her daughter she got during the change of life it was time to go she sewed a note to her ragged coat it said “this is the granddaughter of mama rose” she put fifty cents in her hand and went to stand with her at the bus stop she would not return but her child had earned the right to go home  when i got off the bus a hush fell over the people waiting there i was as white as my mother but my eyes were gray not green i had hair down to my waist and braids so thick they weighed me down mother said my father was a white musician from another town who found out her secret and left her and me to keep it mama rose knew me though blind as she was “what color are you gal” she asked and i told her “i’m as black as last night” thats how i passed without asking permission

 like nearly all women under sixty she would have deftly avoided meeting the eyes of an unknown man  but occasionally an exception happens by chance and her unconscious skill at avoidance gets instantly replaced by a human generosity which is either inherently feminine or gendertrained as you please  she glanced at me exactly when i glanced at her in the store at the mall and so she gave me that momentary slight smile which implies  though many men are dangerous and i do not intend to suggest the slightest likelihood that you and i will meet or talk much less make love and much less together conceive a sweet helpless child still our eyes have just met and in this there is an undeniable contact between your humanity and mine and you are probably coping with some difficulties of masculine humanity while i cope with those of feminine humanity and so i wish you well

 yesterday i found my pipe while pondering a long evening of work of fine winter work thrown aside were my cigarettes with all the childish joys of summer into the past which the leaves shining blue in the sun the muslins illuminate and taken up once again was the grave pipe of a serious man who wants to smoke for a long while without being disturbed so as better to work but i was not prepared for the surprise that this abandoned object had in store for me for hardly had i drawn the first puff when i forgot the grand books i was planning to write and amazed moved to a feeling of tenderness i breathed in the air of the previous winter which was now coming back to me i had not been in contact with my faithful sweetheart since returning to france and now all of london london as i had lived it a year ago entirely alone appeared before my eyes first the dear fogs that muffle one’s brains and have an odor of their own there when they penetrate beneath the casements my tobacco had the scent of a somber room with leather furniture sprinkled by coal dust on which the thin black cat would curl and stretch the big fires and the maid with red arms pouring coals and the noise of those coals falling from the sheetiron bucket into the iron scuttle in the morningwhen the postman gave the solemn double knock that kept me alive once again i saw through the windows those sickly trees of the deserted squarei saw the open sea crossed so often that winter shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened from the fumeswith my poor wandering beloved decked out in traveller’s clothes a long dress dull as the dust of the roads a coat clinging damply to her cold shoulders one of those straw hats with no feather and hardly any ribbons that wealthy ladies throw away upon arrival mangled as they are by the sea and that poor loved ones refurbish for many another season around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief that one waves when saying goodbye forever

 the stroll from my cell along the path above the donkeys past a door open a door shut and a strong smell of wood and cigarettes ends where music helps white marguerites cut through the masonry  dark for words with a clicking wren a yellow tit and over the clover a shovel and a rustle of grain he’s training calves with shouts and food to follow him to another field before the second bell  broom loops over the buttercups these names give birth to cones and needles ferns with minisacs of pollen attached it only takes one shot of spittle on green for my brother to explain the sexual life of the forest and honeybees  simon says he would like to live alone in a cottage with a garden no humans no obligations  solitary i prefer a pod while he likes hives we confess we both wear armor outside our habitats  water was our first armor before our skin then came the bristle of sunshine and a thickening of blood into oil or syrup in the lower veins  i hate the thistledown covering my prototype now interior layer cowering at power or shout but can laugh with the one who has sap under his skin pouring the bucket the hand is carrying  brother help me find an animal who will rescue me from sharp delirium of fear beyond armor and my friends the birds by an open window  to be clear would be wonderful a sigh without the ghostly gasps that accompany a certain voice still i still do desire more of the kind no one can see or hear not that second rasping breath of triumph find me instead more like the breathy saint bernard but a little dog a cask of brandy hanging at his neck

 the pleasure of contrast not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater holding his breath but composing himself  for the camera in his only suit you have to understand photography unforgiving mirror unlike oils that soften  the hard edges of a man’s face if you want them to or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape  the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter that’s not at all how it’s done the camera’s lens blanketed by cloth  to keep it in the dark any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow his eyes already turn inward to that place we’re going  she thinks about escape too at the horse butcher in line like the others or arguing over the price of bread  at the market of innocents adam’s rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer’s fist  but she at least is smiling when he says we have such a small family meaning your body  won’t open to meit’s shackled inside its cage love and rage whose bars are meant to be broken

 what if the primary colors on your spectrum were mud muddled and muddliest benjamin franklin invented the internet so that i could talk to folk but not face to face and i know what purpletailed hawk of thought just perched on your extended wrist but try to fit your average feet in my size 17s fact the average reader processes 300 wpm and maybe they can read other people’s faces like a vegan interrogating a list of ingredients but what if every face was written in braille and you had only catcher’s mitts below your wrists or ikea bookcases with reams of instructions ciphered in tiny print with disappearing ink imagine being so literal that when told to let sleeping dogs lie you asked how a doberman could be dishonest imagine every smiling hint a girl ever sent your way was in a prescription bottle with a youproof cap or a personal pizza delivered 30 minutes late to the door of a boardedup summer bungalow then top that double dose of pepperoni by having even the most casual conversation served with denalisized asides of organic skew fact the us has 95000 miles of shoreline but on this dinner plate the border between the country of carrots and the province of peas can never meet say your brain is a slinky bulletheaded train but your mouth is a horsedrawn amish wagon and what rockets across the endless gray rails of your origamied cranium is ever projected onto your grinning scrim of skin and maybe ben franklin didn’t invent the internet but the internet has plenty pictures of him inventing electricity which is almost the same thing say your friend cynthia r claims it will storm later and you hear oran juice jones singing “i saw you and him walking in the rain” and you beam a lighthouse smile only cynthia says “seriously i saw it on the news” while all you smell is fulllength fur coats matted by a downpour in macarthur park and now cynthia r wants to know what’s so funny but who can say oran juice jones without a concentrated face so you try to collect the loose nickels and pennies of thought spilling from your front pocket but cynthia fires up her smartphone to show you the sevenday forecast and now the foilcovered pots on the back of her electric range are beginning to boil and you say “no i believe you” but she believes in tone of voice the way crayola once believed in a peach crayon called “flesh” or the way banks believe in daily deposits left by a river’s most assiduous visits fact the city of pittsburgh has over 400 bridges let’s say you arch quick when softly pricked as if any foreign finger were a cattle prod and maybe ben franklin didn’t invent electricity but he certainly earned a shiny penny by cutting out the lights during thunderstorms only your steady tone is mono as a sinatra single on the platter of a handcranked victrola and cynthia cocks her head like a small dog that is not boarding your singlestoried boat and now you’re a windwhipped antenna on an empty dinghy bobbing dockside as she steams out of range of your radio’s befuddled dial

 this is her picture as she was it seems a thing to wonder on as though mine image in the glass should tarry when myself am gone i gaze until she seems to stir until mine eyes almost aver that now even now the sweet lips part to breathe the words of the sweet heart and yet the earth is over her  alas even such the thindrawn ray that makes the prisondepths more rude the drip of water night and day giving a tongue to solitude yet only this of loves whole prize remains save what in mournful guise takes counsel with my soul alone save what is secret and unknown below the earth above the skies  in painting her i shrind her face mid mystic trees where light falls in hardly at all a covert place where you might think to find a din of doubtful talk and a live flame wandering and many a shape whose name not itself knoweth and old dew and your own footsteps meeting you and all things going as they came  a deep dim wood and there she stands as in that wood that day for so was the still movement of her hands and such the pure lines gracious flow and passing fair the type must seem unknown the presence and the dream tis she though of herself alas less than her shadow on the grass or than her image in the stream  that day we met there i and she one with the other all alone and we were blithe yet memory saddens those hours as when the moon looks upon daylight and with her i stoopd to drink the springwater athirst where other waters sprang and where the echo is she sang my soul another echo there  but when that hour my soul won strength for words whose silence wastes and kills dull raindrops smote us and at length thunderd the heat within the hills that eve i spoke those words again beside the pelted windowpane and there she hearkend what i said with underglances that surveyd the empty pastures blind with rain  next day the memories of these things like leaves through which a bird has flown still vibrated with loves warm wings till i must make them all my own and paint this picture so twixt ease of talk and sweet long silences she stood among the plants in bloom at windows of a summer room to feign the shadow of the trees  and as i wrought while all above and all around was fragrant air in the sick burthen of my love it seemd each sunthrilld blossom there beat like a heart among the leaves o heart that never beats nor heaves in that one darkness lying still what now to thee my loves great will or the fine web the sunshine weaves  for now doth daylight disavow those daysnought left to see or hear only in solemn whispers now at nighttime these things reach mine ear when the leafshadows at a breath shrink in the road and all the heath forest and water far and wide in limpid starlight glorified lie like the mystery of death  last night at last i could have slept and yet delayd my sleep till dawn still wandering then it was i wept for unawares i came upon those glades where once she walkd with me and as i stood there suddenly all wan with traversing the night upon the desolate verge of light yearnd loud the ironbosomd sea  even so where heaven holds breath and hears the beating heart of loves own breast where round the secret of all spheres all angels lay their wings to rest how shall my soul stand rapt and awd when by the new birth borne abroad throughout the music of the suns it enters in her soul at once and knows the silence there for god  here with her face doth memory sit meanwhile and wait the days decline till other eyes shall look from it eyes of the spirits palestine even than the old gaze tenderer while hopes and aims long lost with her stand round her image side by side like tombs of pilgrims that have died about the holy sepulchre

 i’m having trouble understanding the wife the wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions i want to know how the wife feels when you drag her and your son down into the basement to start a new religion the religion has something to do with cowering before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive i want to know how the wife behaves in small enclosed spaces if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him daddy likes to play funny games or if she is already visualizing herself walking into a women’s shelter your son on her back and maybe because this is a fantasy she carries a burning torch like an angry villager or a goddess does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack the coffee table does she agree with you that the coffee table is yours to destroy because you built it what has she built in the house that is hers to destroy what kind of childhood has the wife endured that allows her to understand you in her past life or lives was the wife ever a shepherdess does she see you as a sort of pan goatish and pricked by ticks but also very wellendowed when the wife transforms into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze inside an idea of growing i would like to see the wife peel off that bark leaving only enough for modesty’s sake although as this is your poem we can take a bit more off i want to see her uproot herself pick up the house and shake it how many people fall out the wife has something about her the germans would call unheimlich i sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife out of the corner of my eye but then i look away i cannot look directly at the wife the wife is a conflagration of everything dear i wonder sometimes if she is faking there is a certain note she holds too long so the orgasm is more operatic less genuine when she criesoh my god really she should stutter let’s say the wife wakes up in the morning you have already made breakfast does your kindness feel oppressive does she want to take your weed whacker through the house has she ever in a fit of anger destroyed your pornography when you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint smacked red on her ass how quickly did your shock turn to arousal are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places and sometimes cannot move for thirty minutes sometimes her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down i think the wife might need some finetuning some elbow grease some wrenching apart and then reassembling

 i sit with my railroad face and ask god to forgive me for being a straight line toward the dead who were buried with their poor clothes in the arizona desert of iron borders  this way of waving to the embers of the past not apologzing for carrying torn rosaries inside my pockets where beads of worry became fossilized insects whose dry husks i kept since a child  faces adopted me from boys who hated their parents i was told not to repeat this reminded by the priest who unmasked himself i was told there was a great horror down the hallway of the smelly catholic school once my friend joey jumped off the second floor window and flattened his brains over the asphalt yard  i see a hibiscus blossom it is a bright yellow flower that lasts one day its shape brings tears saves me from the hummingbird that dots the air with patterns resembling an alphabet too familiar to smell like a railroad worker  i love heaven when i admit the spikes and the railroad ties came from the labor of fate and not the labor of love the tracks are my cross  the tiny car is full of sweating men they look into the eye of the sun hold their hammers over their blackened heads if staring grows in the common search a perfume dots the heart with greed silence between the lightning of pounding stakes  once i rode the train home to see if the smoke from the speeding engine was going to enter my lungs i never wore the old yellow hat of the crew but returned the shovel and the bag of railroad spikes thought i saw my grandfather the foreman running across the desert in overalls changing his skin from brown to the black of the scorched engine  i live with my railroad face its smoothness hammered by sweating crews that knew the line of hot iron was going to end in the west someday i live with my railroad face and don’t know why the tracks disappear on the horizon i cross my railroad face and comb my hair

and the vain mans toast why deckd with all that land and sea afford why angels calld and angellike adord why round our coaches crowd the whiteglovd beaux why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows how vain are all these glories all our pains unless good sense preserve what beauty gains that men may say when we the frontbox grace behold the first in virtue as in face oh if to dance all night and dress all day charmd the smallpox or chasd old age away who would not scorn what housewifes cares produce or who would learn one earthly thing of use to patch nay ogle might become a saint nor could it sure be such a sin to paint but since alas frail beauty must decay curld or uncurld since locks will turn to grey since painted or not painted all shall fade and she who scorns a man must die a maid what then remains but well our powr to use and keep good humour still whateer we lose and trust me dear good humour can prevail when airs and flights and screams and scolding fail beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul  so spoke the dame but no applause ensud belinda frownd thalestris calld her prude to arms to arms the fierce virago cries and swift as lightning to the combat flies all side in parties and begin th attack fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack heroes and heroines shouts confusdly rise and bass and treble voices strike the skies no common weapons in their hands are found like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound  so when bold homer makes the gods engage and heavnly breasts with human passions rage gainst pallas mars latona hermes arms and all olympus rings with loud alarms joves thunder roars heavn trembles all around blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound earth shakes her nodding towrs the ground gives way and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day  triumphant umbriel on a sconces height clappd his glad wings and sate to view the fight proppd on their bodkin spears the sprites survey the growing combat or assist the fray  while through the press enragd thalestris flies and scatters death around from both her eyes a beau and witling perishd in the throng one died in metaphor and one in song o cruel nymph a living death i bear cried dapperwit and sunk beside his chair a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast those eyes are made so killingwas his last thus on mæeanders flowry margin lies th expiring swan and as he sings he dies  when bold sir plume had drawn clarissa down chloe steppd in and killd him with a frown she smild to see the doughty hero slain but at her smile the beau revivd again  now jove suspends his golden scales in air weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair the doubtful beam long nods from side to side at length the wits mount up the hairs subside  see fierce belinda on the baron flies with more than usual lightning in her eyes nor feard the chief th unequal fight to try who sought no more than on his foe to die but this bold lord with manly strength endud she with one finger and a thumb subdud just where the breath of life his nostrils drew a charge of snuff the wily virgin threw the gnomes direct to evry atom just the pungent grains of titillating dust sudden with starting tears each eye oerflows and the high dome reechoes to his nose  now meet thy fate incensd belinda cried and drew a deadly bodkin from her side the same his ancient personage to deck her great great grandsire wore about his neck in three sealrings which after melted down formd a vast buckle for his widows gown her infant grandames whistle next it grew the bells she jingled and the whistle blew then in a bodkin gracd her mothers hairs which long she wore and now belinda wears  boast not my fall he cried insulting foe thou by some other shalt be laid as low nor think to die dejects my lofty mind all that i dread is leaving you benind rather than so ah let me still survive and burn in cupids flamesbut burn alive  restore the lock she cries and all around restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound not fierce othello in so loud a strain roard for the handkerchief that causd his pain but see how oft ambitious aims are crossd the chiefs contend till all the prize is lost the lock obtaind with guilt and kept with pain in evry place is sought but sought in vain with such a prize no mortal must be blest so heavn decrees with heavn who can contest  some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere since all things lost on earth are treasurd there there heros wits are kept in pondrous vases and beaux in snuff boxes and tweezercases there broken vows and deathbed alms are found and lovers hearts with ends of riband bound the courtiers promises and sick mans prayers the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry  but trust the museshe saw it upward rise though markd by none but quick poetic eyes so romes great founder to the heavns withdrew to proculus alone confessd in view a sudden star it shot through liquid air and drew behind a radiant trail of hair not berenices locks first rose so bright the heavns bespangling with dishevelld light the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies and pleasd pursue its progress through the skies  this the beau monde shall from the mall survey and hail with music its propitious ray this the blest lover shall for venus take and send up vows from rosamondas lake this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies when next he looks through galileos eyes and hence th egregious wizard shall foredoom the fate of louis and the fall of rome  then cease bright nymph to mourn thy ravishd hair which adds new glory to the shining sphere not all the tresses that fair head can boast shall draw such envy as the lock you lost for after all the murders of your eye when after millions slain yourself shall die when those fair suns shall set as set they must and all those tresses shall be laid in dust this lock the muse shall consecrate to fame and midst the stars inscribe belindas name

 in the green rags of the bible i tore up the straight silk of childhood on my head i left the house i fled my mother’s brow where i had no ambition but to stroke the writing i raked in  she who dressed in wintersilk my head that month when there is baize on the high wall where the dew cloud presses its lustration and the thrush is but a brooch of rain as the world flies softly in the wool of heaven  i was a guest at my own youth under the lamp tossed by a moth for thirteen winters sentenced to cabbage and kisses by she who crammed an earth against my feet and pulled over me the bright rain storm of fleece  not for me – citizenship of the backdoor where even the poor wear wings while on sunday gamy ventilations raise their dilettante in the bonnet of the satingreen dung fly and fungus sweats a livery of epaulettes  i was a hunter whose animal is that dark hour when the hemisphere moves in deep blue blaze of dews and you brunette of the birdmusic tree stagger in spat diamonds drunkenly  like some saint whose only blasphemy is a magnificent juice vein that plucks his groin with april’s coarse magicianship as green as the jade squirt of fruit i was the child whose breast rocks to a muscle savage as africa  thundercloud your wool was rough with mud as the coat of a wild beast on which flowers grow your brogue of grunts so low they left soil in the mouth after you i walked as through a djinn’s brain gleaming lane  i was incriminated by your hammer in my chest and forfeit to the crepe hoods of my mother’s eyes the iron door of her oven and her church skies cut to blind had but laid on her priest’s mouth the green scabs of winter  but i had the marvellous infection leaning upon my fairy and my dog in the ultramarine latitudes of dew shook like a tear that’s carried through darkness on the knuckles of a woman’s glove  i saw each winter where my henthrush left her fork in famine’s white banqueting cloth could i not read as well the tradesman’s hand with its magenta creases – whose soul turns blandly on a sirloin mattress to smile at the next meal  o she who would paper her lamp with my wings that hour when all the earth is drinking the blue drop of thunder and in dark debris as of a magician’s room my beast a scented breathing to the east

 the bud stands for all things even for those things that don’t flower for everything flowers from within of selfblessing though sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch it is lovely until it flowers again from within of selfblessing as saint francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow and told her in words and in touch blessings of earth on the sow and the sow began remembering all down her thick length from the earthen snout all the way through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them the long perfect loveliness of sow

 when fall brought the graders to atlas road i drove through gray dust thick as a battle and saw the ditch freshly scattered with gravel  leveling shaving on the bevel the blade and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers limestone loaves and blue slate skulls of quartz  not even early freeze had roused some rocks were large as buckets others just a scone tumbled up and into light the first time  in ages loose sharp they were a hazard to anyone passing so i gathered what i could scooped them into the bed  and trucked my freight away under birdsong in my own lifes autumn i was eager to add to the snaggled wall bordering  my single acre to be safe to be still and watch the planets purposeful turning behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones  uprooted scarred weathergray of bones i love their old smell the familiar unknown to be sure this time i know where i belong  i have brought at last the vagrant road home

 chekhov at yalta a winter evening at the cottage by the bay and i sat in the black and gold of the dead garden wrapped in blankets eating my sister’s suet pudding the fountain was wrapped in dirty straw and  just below my property in the old tartar cemetery there was a small funeral in progress the widow is wearing a purple shawl the children are bare around the shoulders and the girls are wearing orange petals  at their throats the ashen white beards of the men are like immaculate vests from this distance there is nothing more intolerable than suet pudding unless it is the visitors the drunken visitors laughing  in my kitchen eating my duck and venison while i hide from them here in the dark garden the daughter of one of these gentlemen is pretty i saw her through the window drinking  champagne from a clay mugjust under her thin blouse i saw the blue points of her breasts that turn in opposition both out and up like the azure slippers of the priest who is now singing in the cemetery below my house  once the family has gone off with its torches i’ll climb down to the fresh grave and drop some coins for flowers even wooden teeth for the widow so she can  attract a new husband the black turned soil or our garden reminds me of the common grave given to the children of the godunov orphanage after that horrible fire  a charred horse was thrown in with them bags of lime and what i understood to be a large ham that the authorities nevertheless declared the torso of a male child of nine or ten the czar  in their memory placed a tiny trout pond over them and this inscriptiona blue blanket for my little ones my wife goes nearly naked to parties in moscow my sister here at yalta goes sea bathing with a rope  around her that runs back to the beach where it is attached to a donkey who is commanded by a servant with a long switch the sea tows her out and then the donkey is whipped  sorrowfully until he has dragged her back to them i named the donkey moon after the mystery of his service to my sister this winter he has been an excellent friend  i read to this poor beast from three sisters he is a better critic and audience than i could find in the cities i have won an award that will save me from arrest anywhere inside russia i am going to refuse it and then travel  to nice or paris my tuberculosis is worse tolstoi reads my stories to his family after supper and reads them badly i suppose i did walk that evening all the way down to the cemetery  only to discover that my pockets were empty i screamed up to the house for coins for plenty of coins the visitors laughing and singing ran down to me without coats and with a lantern swinging  my sister trailed behind them on her donkey her square black hat bobbing like a steamer way out in the bay and when they reached me  i said “sister pack the trunks you hurt me i will write that we have departed for france for italy”

 it sat between my husband and my children a place was set for ita plate of greens it had been there i had seen it but not somehowbut this was like a dream not seen it so that i knew i saw it it was as if i could not know i saw it because i had never once in all my life not seen it it was an eland an elandthat is why the children would ask my husband for a joke at christmas “father is it donner” he would say “no blitzen” it had been there always now we put silver at its place at meals fed it the same food we ourselves ate and said nothing many times when it breathed heavily when it had tried a long useless time to speak and reached to me so that i touched itof a different size and order of being like the live hard side of a horse’s neck when you pat the horse and looked with its great melting tearless eyes fringed with a few coarse wirelike lashes into my eyes and whispered to me so that my eyes turned backward in their sockets and they said nothing many times i have known when they said nothing that it did not exist if they had heard they could not have been silent and yet they heard heard many times what i have spoken when it could no longer speak but only breathe when i could no longer speak but only breathe  and after some years the others came and took it from meit was ill they told me and cured it they wrote me my whole city sent me cards lilacbranches mourning as i had mourned and i was standing by a grave in flowers by dyed rolls of turf and a canvas marquee the last brown of earth  it is over it is over so long that i begin to think that it did not exist that i have never and my son says one morning from the paper “an eland look an eland” it was so  today in a german dictionary i saw elend and the heart in my breast turned over it was  it was a word one translates wretched  it is as if someone remembered saying “this is an antimacassar that i grew from seed” and this were true and truly one could not wish for anything more strange for anything more and yet it wasn’t interesting     it was worse than impossible it was a joke  and yet when it was i was even to think that i once thought that i could see it to feel the sweat like needles at my hairroots i am blind  it was not even a joke not even a joke yet how can i believe it or believe that i owned it a husband children is my voice the voice of that skin of beingof what owns is owned in honor or dishonor that is borne and bears or of that raw thing the being inside it that has neither a wife a husband nor a child but goes at last as naked from this world as it was born into it  and the eland comes and grazes on its grave  this is senseless shall i make sense or shall i tell the truth choose eitheri cannot do both  i tell myself that and yet it is not so and what i say afterwards will not be so to be at all is to be wrong being is being old and saying almost comfortably across a table from from what i don’t know in a voice rich with a kind of longing satisfaction “to own an eland that’s what i call life”

 everyone comes here from a long way off is a line from a poem i read last night               driving up 80 in the haze they talked and talked smoke in the air shimmering from wildfires his story was sad and hers was roiled troubled              alternatively  a man and a woman old friends are in a theater watching a movie in which a man and a woman old friends are driving through summer on a mountain road the woman is describing the end of her marriage and sobbing shaking her head and laughing and sobbing the man is watching the road listening his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance and because in the restaurant before the film the woman had been describing the end of her marriage and cried they are not sure whether they are in the theater or on the mountain road and when the timber truck comes suddenly around the bend they both flinch              he found that it was no good trying to tell what happened that day everything he said seemed fictional the moment that he said it the rain the scent of her hair what she said as she was leaving and why it was important for him to explain that the car had been parked under eucalyptus on a hillside and how velvety and blurred the trees looked through the windshield not he said that making fictions might not be the best way of getting at it but that nothing he said had the brute abject unassimilated quality of a wounding experience the ego in any telling was already seeing itself as a character and a character he said was exactly what he was not at that moment even as he kept wanting to explain to someone to whomever would listen that she had closed the door so quietly and so firmly that the beads of rain on the side window didn’t even quiver              names for involuntary movements of the body squirm wince flinch and shudder sound like a law firm in dickens “mr flinch took off his black gloves as if he were skinning his hands” “quiver dipped the nib of his pen into the throat of the inkwell”              the receptionist at the hospital morgue told him to call the city medical examiner’s office but you only got a recorded voice on weekends              setup without the punchline  three greenhorns are being measured for suits by a very large tailor on hester street              once there were two sisters called knock me and sock me their best friend was a bear named always arguing what kind of animals were the sisters one child asked maybe they could be raccoons said the other or pandas said the first they could be pandas              “why” he asked “because she was lonely and angry” said the friend who knew her better “and she’d run out of stories or come to the one story”              it is good to sit down to birthday cake with children who think it is the entire point of life and who therefore respect each detail of the ceremony there ought to be a rule he thought for who gets to lick the knife that cuts the cake and the rule should have its pattern somewhere in the winter stars which do you add to the tea first he’d asked the sugar or the milk and the child had said instantly “the milk” laws as cool and angular as wordsangularsidereal              stories about the distribution of wealth once upon a time there was an old man and an old women who were very very poor              how eldie got her name  the neighborhood had been so dangerous she said there was one summer when the mailmen refused to deliver the mail her mother never appeared and her grandmother who had bought a handgun for protection and had also taught her how to use it would walk her to the post office for the sweet singsong halfrhymed letters that smelled or that she imagined smelled of florida she had when she was ten shot at an intruder climbing in the window the roar she said was tremendous and she doesn’t know to this day whether she hit the man or not a bigboned young woman skin the color of the inside of some lightcolored hazelnut confection auburn eyes some plucked string of melancholy radiating from her whole body when she spoke did her mama come back they had asked she never came back the mail started up again but the letters stopped turned out she was good in school and that was what saved her she loved the labor of schoolwork loved finishing a project and contemplating the neatness of her script her grandmother shook her head sometimes amused and proud and called her “little diligence”              punchline without the setup and the three nuns from immaculate conception nodded and smiled as they passed because they thought he was addressing them in latin              he had known as long as he’d known anything that he had a father somewhere when he was twelve his mother told him why he had no shadow              because she not her sister answered the door she was the first to hear the news              a ballad  he loved to watch that woman sew she let her hair grow long for show riddle’s a needle a refrain might go and plainly said is thread              she looked beautiful and looked her age too she’d had a go at putting herself together she had always had the confidence that with a face like hers a few touches to represent the idea of a puttogether look would do like some set designer’s genius minimalism it had a slightly harridan effect and he remembered that it wasn’t what was headlong or slapdash about her but the way they gestured like a quotation at an understanding of elegance it would have been boring to spell out that had at first dazzled him about her he felt himself stirring at this recognition and at a certain memory that attended it and then laughed at the thought that he had actually stimulated himself with an analysis of her style and she said as if she were remembering the way he could make her insecure “what what are you smiling about” and he said “nothing” and she said “oh yes right i remember nothing”              two jokes walk into a bar  a cage went in search of a bird  a boy walks out in the morning with a gun  three rabbis walk into a penguin              in the other world the girls were named eleanor and filina and one night it was very warm and they could not sleep for the heat and the stillness and they went outside beyond the wall of their parents’ garden and into a meadow it was a dark night moonless and the stars were so thick they seemed to shudder and the sisters stood a long time in the sweet smell of the cooling grasses looking at the sky and listening in the silence after a while they heard a stirring and saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching them from the woods’ edge “maybe it’s their friend the bear” one of the children said “i don’t like this story” said the other

 her voice is a roundness on full moon days she talks about renouncing meat but the butcher has his routine and blood  m’s wisdom still reliable  there are sounds we cannot hear but understand in motion slicing of air with hips crushing grass saying these are my feet i want my feet in my shadow suffice to meet desires halfway  quiet we say her chakras are in place  when the thermos shatters she knows the direction of its spill she knows how to lead and follow know her from this  sounds we cannot hear the wind blows and we say it is cool  night slips under the door we are tucked into bed and kissed a fleeting one through the curtains her voice loosens like thread from an old blanket row upon row we watch her teeth in the dark and read her words she speaks in perfect order facing where the breeze can tug it towards canals stretching for sound  her faith abides by the cycle of the moon see how perfect she is

 “o love thou art winged and swift yet stay with me evermore” and i guarded my house with bolt and bar lest love fly forth at the door  without in the world ’t was cold while love and i together laughed and sang by my red hearthfire nor knew it was winter weather  sweet love would lull me to sleep in his tireless arm caressed his shadowing wings and burning eyes like night and stars wrought rest  and ever the beat of love’s heart as a chime rang at my ear and ever love’s bending beautiful face covered me close from fear  was it long ere i waked alone a snowdrift whitened the floor i saw spent ashes upon my hearth and death in my open door

 you shout my name from beyond my dreams beyond the picture window of this rosarito beach house rushing from bed to shore i glimpse their backs volcanoes rising out of the sea your back a blueblack silhouette feet wet with the wash of morning waves fountains spring from mammal minds my hands lifting a splash of sand im on my knees toes finding a cool prayer beneath them fingers pressing sea foam to my temples while you open arms wide as a generation raise them to a compass point dive if you could reach them you would ride their fins under the horizon then surf the crash of waves left in their wake and if i could grasp my own fear id drown it leave it breathless and blue as this ocean as the brilliant backs of whales surfacing for air

 now that i have your face by heart i look less at its features than its darkening frame where quince and melon yellow as young flame lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd’s crook beyond a garden there in insolent ease the lead and marble figures watch the show of yet another summer loath to go although the scythes hang in the apple trees  now that i have your face by heart i look  now that i have your voice by heart i read in the black chords upon a dulling page music that is not meant for music’s cage whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed the staves are shuttled over with a stark unprinted silence in a double dream i must spell out the storm the running stream the beat’s too swift the notes shift in the dark  now that i have your voice by heart i read  now that i have your heart by heart i see the wharves with their great ships and architraves the rigging and the cargo and the slaves on a strange beach under a broken sky o not departure but a voyage done the bales stand on the stone the anchor weeps its red rust downward and the long vine creeps beside the salt herb in the lengthening sun  now that i have your heart by heart i see

 i had not thought of violets late the wild shy kind that spring beneath your feet in wistful april days when lovers mate and wander through the fields in raptures sweet the thought of violets meant florists shops and bows and pins and perfumed papers fine and garish lights and mincing little fops and cabarets and soaps and deadening wines so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed i had forgot wide fields and clear brown streams the perfect loveliness that god has made wild violets shy and heavenmounting dreams and nowunwittingly youve made me dream of violets and my souls forgotten gleam

 i lived with visions for my company instead of men and women years ago and found them gentle mates nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played to me but soon their trailing purple was not free of this worlds dust  their lutes did silent grow and i myself grew faint and blind below their vanishing eyes then thou didst come  to be belovèd what they seemed their shining fronts their songs their splendours better yet the same as riverwater hallowed into fonts met in thee and from out thee overcame my soul with satisfaction of all wants  because gods gifts put mans best dreams to shame

 to beat the froggiest of morning voices my son gets out of bed and takes a lumpish song alonga little lyric learned in kindergarten something about a boat he’s found it in the bog of his throat before his feet have hit the ground follows its wonky melody down the hall and into the loo as if it were the most natural thing for a little boy to do and lets it loose awhile in there to a tinkling sound while i lie still in bed alive like i’ve never been in love again with life afraid they’ll find me drowned here drowned in more than my fair share of joy

 you give me a little courage mary in your skittish dedication to her highness i too can dare as humbleness may dare if there’s anywhere to speak with you it’s here at the wordy anglosaxon periphery of the universe’s one great surge of praise  though i’m lost here where’s the joyful noise the syllables i managed to memorize before they were weighted down by meaning and what’s all this complicated rhyme don’t mistake mei’m not complaining it’s just not my notion of a psalm  for all my love of wrought elaborate things especially when they’re the sort that sings and yours do sing a stunning song but they’re offkilter without the awe inherent in my ancient holy tongue i miss my amen sela hallelujah  though i do applaud you and your brother going for the full linguistic baitandswitch in the move from one language to another david’s disarmingly direct speech a tourdeforce of formal contrivance no form repeated more than once  in each of a hundred fifty psalms in your showoffvirtuoso hands talk about such a song in such a land but what else is there in dreary england its sole extravagance a trove of synonyms that endlessly perplexes and expands  its mongrel unbeautiful tongue a language frankly crying out for poetry given its absence even of integrity not to mention intrinsic song    its sound water going down the drain according to my friend an italian  after riding in a compartment of americans gurgling all the way from florence to rome why not a convoluted scheme of intricately wrought meter and rhyme so what if the hebrew has no strict patterns aim for a parallel sublime  aren’t poems for the impossible though perhaps yours wouldn’t have been written had you known how daunting their task was you had no hebrew used the coverdale wyatt geneva bible as cribs for latin even psaumes de david mis en rime françoise     clearly your secret weapon was ignorance also useful look at me in writing a poem your psalms fourth and fifthhand half the time unless of course your stroke of brilliance was to focus on the one thing you could do sing and let your song be new  which they are profoundly even to me who know so many bits of the originals of what you claim you’re “translating” by heart still i’ll be reading along alternately put off and spellbound by your art ifice when my wary eye suddenly falls  on something both completely known and new my ownour ownungainly language for a brief instant alien with grace a blackonwhite typescript mirage in which english letters turn into hebrew or at least intercept its holiness     how did you manage it mary your contemporaries called it piety but i don’t believe that for a second what motivated you was love of poetry or rather of your legendary brotherlost so youngwhom you would spend  your whole life working to immortalize    i’m not sure he needed you no lighter touch exists in english poetry than his    a touch you often managed to approach in your griefinduced lyric resolve to force a bit of him to stay alive  poetry as solace as wizardry and there he is with you all the time clearly palpable in all your artistry it was your eagerness to be with him that kept you going back to intervene with yet one more indomitable line  got you through all hundredfifty psalms or maybe it was just your poet’s ruse poetry often thrives on selfdelusion to trick yourself to rise to his occasion    unless he just provided the excuse to stake your own quite vast poetic claims  impossible to say from this vantage point to distinguish collaborator from muse selfdoubt from false humility but then again there’s a poetry in mystery who will contradict me if i confuse my own passions with yoursso convenient  inevitablein a poem like this though you and idespite the labyrinth of misapprehension class religion reinforcing our dissociation jew from christian commoner from countess twentyfirstcentury from seventeenth  come together in passion upon passion forgive me mary if dare too far psalms poetic forms your genius brother i mean both the poet and the man no poem could manufacture that much charm we’ve even suffered from a kindred harm  my version albeit fairly mild though i too was admonished as a child about what a woman dared not do still i have a vast cohort while you were almost entirely alone better yet i had the complete dickinson  published just a year before i was born i didn’t know it yet but i had you    while you had to ransack antiquity for even fragments of poems by a woman but of course you weren’t troubled by inequity it was frankly all you knew  you might even have relished your position as sole woman poet thinker patron lonely as it wasthough you did encourage your precocious niece mary later wroth and who can really estimate the damage of your appalling bargain a brother’s death  required to turn you into poet of course in your time death was everywhere perhaps you were piousa last resort to shore up an attenuated heart against even further disrepair immersion in the psalms a sort of antidote  to life’s massive overdose of pain from living with a sad disfigured mother smallpox scars from nursing a sick queen mourning her husband’s lost affection to deaths of favoritesyour sister your brother your only daughters katherine then anne  god made this day he did us send it in joy and mirth then let us spend it excellent advice if it would hold and maybe it does when you can summon all that air or life enfold to distract you with a binge of exaltation     or if that fails then an assiduous extravaganza of sublime detail calibrated to provide the wherewithal to face a universe we cannot alter if not with joy and mirth at least with grace a perfect handilluminated psalter  the loops of all its letters filled with gold a treasure even for an exacting queen offering a deity who’ll listen to a voice alternately humble bold beseeching thankful ecstatic bleak through which hallelujah mary you still speak

 dear to my heart as life’s warm stream which animates this mortal clay for thee i court the waking dream and deck with smiles the future day and thus beguile the present pain with hopes that we shall meet again  yet will it be as when the past twined every joy and care and thought and o’er our minds one mantle cast of kind affections finely wrought ah no the groundless hope were vain for so we ne’er can meet again  may he who claims thy tender heart deserve its love as i have done for kind and gentle as thou art if so beloved thou art fairly won bright may the sacred torch remain and cheer thee till we meet again

 i wanted to be sure to reach you though my ship was on the way it got caught in some moorings i am always tying up and then deciding to depart in storms and at sunset with the metallic coils of the tide around my fathomless arms i am unable to understand the forms of my vanity or i am hard alee with my polish rudder in my hand and the sun sinking to you i offer my hull and the tattered cordage of my will the terrible channels where the wind drives me against the brown lips of the reeds are not all behind me yet i trust the sanity of my vessel and if it sinks it may well be in answer to the reasoning of the eternal voices the waves which have kept me from reaching you

 i have arrived here after taking many steps over the kitchen floors of friends and through their lives  the duncolored hills have been good to me and the gold rivers  i have loved chrysantheumums and children i have been grandmother to some  in one pocket i have hidden chocolates from you and knives  speaking my real thoughts to no one  in bars and at lecterns i have told the truth fairly often but hardly ever to myself  i have not cried out against the crimes of my country  but i have protected myself i have watched from a safe corner the rape of mountains the eagle’s reckless plunge   ever since high school i have waved goodbye to history  i have assisted you to grow in all ways that were convenient to me  what is a block vote against steam shovels  my current events teacher was a fine man but his moral precepts were a putup job and i followed them  welldressed in my new adidas at every gathering i investigated my psyche with friends  and they investigated theirs with me   but whenever trouble came in the front door i ran out the back and fell into the pit of my bones  escaped from those burning buildings the past what balance can any of us hope for  i was comparing lipsticks the day nagasaki vanished  the day solzhenitsyn disappeared into the gulag i was attending a cocktail party  perhaps there are only ashes in my handbag  a man at the corner of broadway and fortysecond street tried to sweep me into a trash barrel and i almost agreed  already the dried blood was sifting along my wrists  already my own hands were tightening around my throat   but sorrow saved me sorrow gave me an image of bombs like human tears watering the world’s gardens  how could i not answer  since then i have been planting words in every windowbox poking them to grow up  what’s god that he should be mindful of me  sometimes i feel like wood waiting for someone to peel me   indeed i have been lukewarm at heart which is all that matters  of tiny breadcolored atoms equal fragments equally dispersed  that love each other and are never hungry   what have i ever ignited that warmed anyone  i have not followed the rivers  dangerous as a pine needle packed in among others in the dense multitudes  and dry timbers of the west  i am afraid of greed the rich taste of it the anger  hidden in my pockets   columns of smoke on the horizon pillars of green fire  but i have arrived here somehow neither have i stopped talking  numberless are the kitchens i have sat in chewing my fingers trying to say something  anything so that the daughters of men should see as many sides of themselves as possible   word after word my footprints have stumbled across deserts  how should i escape them they keep following after me  a little wind stirs itself whisks across my eyelids  and i know what it is before i say it  what if the world really articulates itself in the socket of a human knee   god save me from the swamps of hubris but it may be it may be  before the idea the impulse  i feel it moving in me it is there arthritic but still powerful a seizure  delicate as grasshoppers a light gathering in the skull  between thumb and forefinger and the ballbearing joints of the tongue  in soft glottal convulsions out of no alien skies  but out of the mind’s muscle the hieroglyph figures rise   the little histories of words cannot be eaten  i know it you know it and the children  but the images we make are our own  in the cool caves of the intellect the twisted roots of them lead us  backwards and then forwards   if only we could understand what’s in our pockets is for everyone  i have a dictionary in one hand a mirror  strangers look at themselves in it tracing the expressions they use  from one family to the next they comfort themselves murmuring  the tongues we speak are a blizzard of words like warm wool flying  in the shy conjugal rites of verb consonant vowel  in the dark mucosal flesh lining the prismed underside of the skin  each one is a spark sheared from the veined fleece of the spirit  of the lookingglass body we live in  it is the one i have been cherishing the one all of us speak from  for the world as we know it moves necessarily by steps  breath pulse beat ten digital stops  at the foot of the mountains i look up does god lift up his hand to cover them  blinded by tears like rain my bones turn granite the spine of the hills congeals them   where is the eye of the storm or where is the center of my seeing  the wind of my breath is a hurricane i am locked inside myself  painfully up the bald stepladder i climb  but sometimes the light in my head goes on more like the sun than a match  just as they said in arabia  there’s a huge pantalooned angel swelling inside the body’s glass jar  the whitehaired thread of steam from the teakettle on the range whistles  and sharpens itself into a voice  bodiless as history invisible but still whispering in ears  that keep trying to hear it  it is as if midgets were bellowing their names down sets of cardboard cylinders  but we have not disappeared yet  my friends we have said many things to each other  in new combinations seed upon seed exploding and blossoming in kitchen gardens  i confess i am ashamed of myself  i have not tried hard enough to understand or listen to you speak   but the word is mindful of itself and always has been  littering every street  in the sly eyes of tin cans drops of water in the gutter  the world looks back at us   from every known language yoruba hebrew chinese  arrogant english the subject subjecting all to its desires  even the softer tongues romantic  selfreflexive done to as we would be done by  whatever life we cultivate out of the animal moans of childhood  it is all wheat fields all grass growing and being grown  with poisoned bread in my pockets or gumdrops or armies like myrmidons rising  what i say is true for a time only thank god  if i have only arrived anywhere it is to look carefully at all i thought i knew   in living rivers of speech the reflections i make are my own  and yet not  though the old growth rings are hidden from us and the echoing tomorrows of the acorn  the warm currents of the senses are a twoway street my friends  the palms of our hands are crisscrossed with as many intersections as a leaf

 i mother 18921973  my mother with a skin of crêpe de chine predominantly yellowcolored sheer enough to let the venous blue show through the secondarily bluish carapace coughs rasps and rattles in her terminal dream interrupted by lucidities when suctioned out and listening with hard ears almost waned to stone she hears me say “mother we’re here the two of us are here anne’s here with me” and she says “anne is so so pretty” as if abdicating all her principalities of prettiness so noted in her teens when she smote all who saw her shake a leg upon the stage of vaudevilleand sinking into deeps where ancience lurks and barebone toothlessness and bareback exits from the centre ring of cynosure of little less is left when we leave a stick figure of a once quite formidable personage it is

thousand metres high ahead of us above the passes where the dead take formal leave of life a kiss on both cheeks of the dear departing medals stripped with all due ceremony from his breast both epaulets cut loose from their braid stays his sword unbroken pommelled in the hand of his reliever lastly a salute fired by the arms of officers the guns of other ranks and a flat bugle call played on a battered spanish instrument with ragged tassels as the body falls over the parapetgaining weightlessness as its flesh deliquesces as its bones shiver to ashesinto an air that crawls with all the

of cumulonimbi in the west which roll in with deceptive stealth revealing a black heart cut with a cicatrice of fire zigzagging to its ground a naked peak kilometres away a serra out of mind i fix your face with a wax smile our hands articulate our oneness soon to dissipate in a stiff splay of joints is all the language at my tongue’s command too little to announce my stammered thanks for your unquestioning hand at my side too much to say i know the lowly deuce is a poor card to play beside the ace black with his curlicues and his strong pulse of sauve qui peut ambition calling a spade a spade i’m pierced with the extreme regret of one who dies intestate as i’m snatched into the stormcloud from the springing field from green to black i spy on you below a lone maid in green wheat and rain farewells and late apologies on your grey head and thunder sorrows and regrets the storm goes east and the sun picks out my remains against the cloud a tentative rainbow an inverse weak and spectral kind of smile   3 alone  the long march up the fulvous ridgebacks to the marches the frontiers of difference where flesh marches with bone day marches with his wife the night and country marches with another countryis accomplished best by paradox alone a world of twos of yangs and yins of lives and objects of sound grasses and deaf stones is best essayed by sole infiltrators who have cast off their ties to living moorings and stand out into the roads of noon approaching night casting a single shadow earnest of their honorable intention to lay down their lives for their old country humankind in the same selfish spirit that inspired their lifelong journey largely and at last alone across the passes that divide a life from every other the sheer crags of overweening will the deepening scarps like brain fissures that cunningly cut off each outcrop from the main and make it one while its luck lasts while its bravura holds against all odds until the final climb across the mountains to the farther shore of sundown on the watersheds where self propelled by its last rays sways in the sway of the last grasses and falls headlong in the darkness of the dust it is part of upon the passes where we are no more where the recirculating shaft goes home into the breast that armed it for the air and as we must expect the art that there turned our lone hand into imperial rome reverts to earth and its inveterate love for the inanimate and its return  finis

 books are doorshaped portals carrying me across oceans and centuries helping me feel less alone  but my mother believes that girls who read too much are unladylike and ugly so my fathers books are locked in a clear glass cabinet i gaze at enticing covers and mysterious titles but i am rarely permitted to touch the enchantment of words  poems stories plays all are forbidden girls are not supposed to think but as soon as my eager mind begins to race free thoughts rush in to replace the trapped ones  i imagine distant times and faraway places ghosts vampires ancient warriors fantasy moves into the tangled maze of lonely confusion  secretly i open an invisible book in my mind and i step through its magical doorshape into a universe of dangerous villains and breathtaking heroes  many of the heroes are men and boys but some are girls so tall strong and clever that they rescue other children from monsters

 one thing i’m not doing in my poems reporting on anything that really happened  when i say i’m from new york glaswegians say “oh i love woody allen” they cannot construe how large a state can be i just happen to actually be from manhattan  how impractical to imagine that a structure like a government would be responsive to the needs of such a lot of people held like in a holding pen  in the early 1990s i saw a yellow indian drunk in a tattoo parlor in seattle he literally said he could literally see right through me if he said it figuratively i took it literally  a lot of people in america do not want regulation from the government in principle our forefathers our persecution ideally we wouldn’t need industries and individual actions to be regulated we wouldn’t even need laws  people including people who run corporations or work for them would just behave responsibly corporations would take the responsibility of personhood seriously  my mother cannot be trusted to restrict me from buying rrated videogames at the porn store  my mother struggled to love methe firstborn had been so tractableshe still struggles to love mecan she be commanded to love me now i see what those commandments are about there must be a god  objectively we could expect that our family members would go out of their way to behave toward us with extra care concern and with love  sometimes there is a harsh disjunction between what objective perception would suggest to us we might expect and what really takes place or “occurs” within the framework of what we call “our lives”  i really saw the other day for the first time that my mother did not naturally take to mei am not much like her it would take an effort for her to understand what matters to me her love will come around  my own daughter is quite different from mei thinkit’s hard to tell she is only five years old but she looks different  t akes after her father as i took after mineand so far her concerns are not my own she loves pink i hate pink my love moves faster  where would that moral activity come from to behave responsibly toward others not to overcharge not to seek loopholes not to dominate not to oppress does anyone consciously oppress i guess some spousal abuse comes from the pure urge to dominate and the ire that results when that domination is resisted or thwarted     but is it a pure urge or is it coming from an inscribed narrative of gendered hierarchy like a man wearing a wifebeater has been told too many times that his wife is supposed to listen to him and obey him now if he can be told by the government that “my strength is not for hurting” a local billboard campaign maybe that will ring in his ears when he lifts his fist  if the government doesn’t do it who will do it the church used to do it and still does the one time i went to church with my mother in tennessee when we were at a family reunion and the whole family had certain activities and one of them was “church on sunday” i was brought to tears by the simple goodness of the message that the pastor or reverend ministerthis was a methodist churchwas preaching it was father’s day actually and he talked about how fathers ought to make sure to spend time with their kids turn off the tv he said and spend some time with your kids  i was crying because i am not used to an experience of shared instruction in goodness it was very moving to be in a room with real people all receiving the same instruction

 i think first of two sparrows i met when walking home late night years ago in another city not unlike this  the one  bird frantic attacking i thought the way she swooped down circled my head and flailed her wings in my face  how she seemed to scream each time i swung how she dashed back and forth between me and a bloodred corolla  parked near the opposite curb how finally i understood i spied another bird also calling its foot inexplicably  caught in the car’s closed door beating its whole bird body against it trying it appeared to bang himself free  and who knows how long he’d been there wailing who knows  he and the other i mistook at first for a bat  they called to me  something between squawk and chirp something between song and prayer  to do something  anything and like any good god i disappeared not indifferent exactly but with things to do and most likely  on my way home from another heartbreak call it 1997 and say i’m several thousand miles from home by which  i mean those were the days i made of everyone a love song by which i mean i was lonely and unrequited but that’s  not quite it either truth is i did manage to find a few to love me but couldn’t always love them back the rasta  law professor the firefighter’s wife the burlesque dancer whose daughter blackened drawings with m s to mean  the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died i think his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip  anyway i’m digressing but if you asked that night  did i mention it was night  why i didn’t even try  to jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow i couldn’t say truthfully that it had anything to do with envy with wanting  a woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did one for the other no i’d have said something instead  about the neighborhood itself the car thief shot a block and a half east the week before or about the men  i came across nights prior sweatslicked and shirtless grappling in the middle of the street the larger one’s chest  pressed to the back of the smaller bruised and bleeding both i know you thought this was about birds  but stay with me i left them both in the street  the same street where i’d leave the sparrows  the men  embracing and for all one knows especially one not from around there they could have been lovers   the one whispering an old old tune into the ear of the other baby baby don’t leave me this way i left  the men where i’d leave the sparrows and their song and as i walked away i heard one of the men call to me  please or help or brother or some such and i didn’t break stride not one bit it’s how i’ve learned to save myself  let me try this another way call it 1977 and say i’m back west south central los angeles my mother  and father at it again but this time in the street broad daylight and all the neighbors watching one  i think his name was sonny runs out from his duplex to pull my father off you see where i’m going with this  my mother crying out fragile as a sparrow sonny fighting my father fragile as a sparrow and me  years later trying to get it all down as much for you  i’m saying  as for me sonny catches a left lies flat  on his back blood starting to pool and his own wife wailing my mother wailing and traffic backed  now half a block horns whistles and soon sirens 1977 summer and all the trees full of birds hundreds  i swear and since i’m the one writing it i’ll tell you they were crying which brings me back to dolphy  and his transcribing the jazzman i think wanted only to get it down pure to get it down exact  the animal  racking itself against a car’s steel door the animals in the trees reporting the animals we make of ourselves  and one another stay with me now don’t leave me days after the dustup my parents took me to the park  and in this park was a pond and in this pond were birds not sparrows but swans and my father spread a blanket  and brought from a basket some apples and a paring knife summertime my mother wore sunglasses and long sleeves  my father now sober cursed himself for leaving the radio but my mother forgave him and said as she caressed  the back of his hand that we could just listen to the swans and we listened and i watched two birds coupling  one beating its wings as it mounted the other summer 1977 i listened and watched when my parents made love  late into that night i covered my ears in the next room scanning the encyclopedia for swans it meant nothing to me   then at least  but did you know the collective noun for swans is a lamentation and is a lamentation not  its own species of song what a woman wails punch drunk in the street or what a widow might sing learning her man  was drowned by swans a lamentation of them imagine the capsized boat the panicked man struck about the eyes  nose and mouth each time he comes up for air imagine the birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm  either trumpet swans or mutes the dead man’s wife running for help crying to any who’d listen a lamentation  and a city busy saving itself i’m digressing sure but did you know that to digress means to stray from the flock  when i left my parents’ house i never looked back by which i mean i made like a god and disappeared as when i left  the sparrows and the copulating swans as when someday i’ll leave this city its every flailing its every animal song

NEW POEM
 1  in prologue let me plainly say i shall not ever come to that discretion where i do not rage to think i grow decrepit burstenbellied bald and toothless thick of hearing tremulous of leg dry and roughbarked as a hemlock slab the soft rot setting in and all my wheezy dreams the tunnelling of beetles in a raspy bark for now i am fleshed at smaller sports and grow in time into the mineral thick fell of earth vermont hairy with violets roses lilies and like minions and darlings of the spring meantime working wonders rousing astonishments and being a humble man i at the same time acknowledge my miscreate the nightshades cabbages and fleaworts of my plot though always i try to turn my back and scorn upon the inkhorn term and speak as is most commonly received with smile and wink and approbative nod not overfine nor at the same time reckless of the phrase nor ever ugly turdy tutmouthed but always joyous at the goosey brain the woolpack of the solid cloud a crowd a heap a troop a plume of trees grass gulls and rabbits in the end no doubt a vulgar prattle but the planet swells and bulges and protrudes beyond my eyes’ aversions and tottery fuddled always i give up i am not understood or wrongly out of some general assumption of my innocence   2  this much i wish to say my nonesuch nosegay native sweet in someway plainer this is my letter to you and out of most severe purpose the bee the honey stalk the whole keep of the house endanger me the perspectives of the clapboard the steep falls of the lawn the razory apices of ridges and the abdominous curves of the meadow into the far trees there are ponds below the house and water runs the road crosses the water and the road diminishes to the reach of the next farm and the farm beyond that and two miles bearing right or left somewhere runs highway 25 i have found my way with difficulty i am confused halfway i have suffered a failure of vital powers a swoon have been smirked at by the natives and misdirected fitting for i always dream of the painless redemption the return from fiasco and tumultuous journey to the transcendentally serene lawns of a transcendentally white house with columns of oak trees and iron deer and the affectionate greeting of one who has these many years waited in full patience without complaint for me to come in bleeding dusty and deliquescent from the fields the blade in my thigh or blinded the victim of fire or ravenous birds the lovely blood on my cheek like tears onelimbed a bullet in my heart my hands my head cut off and the dark pulses of my blood diminishing yet never a reproach for my criminal selfnegligence my careless japeries and clumsy flounderings instead my brow is wiped my wounds attended to blood let leeches applied i heal i grow strong i can set forth again renewed valiant sturdy full of high spirits lively gay spruce in looks a reveler a merry prankster dimpled in the cheek from smiling perfect pilgrim fit for the chemistry of the resurrection yet  i am of wild and changeful moods i am perhaps worthy of being stoned sometimes i lie hid and lurk in wait for the giggling girleries and leap out and shout and scatter them like chickens from the boot to the safe and flying four winds i am easy and fluent in the telling of lies and let it be said that i roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places and shall no doubt for this little vain merriment find a sorrowful reckoning in the end still my noises please me and what this wretched poet overmuch desires he easily believes it is his conventional cowardice it makes him immortally glad but then he always grows morose that is in his favor he repents lances his soul thinks of the willows and the columned porch and the wind melliloquent about the chimneys and you from where he sits now at the far end of this small porch of a federal farmhouse in this very and summery vermont   3  i look down the pitches of the lawn fireflies make small explosions among the grass stems and i think that to walk down that slant of lawn to the black waters of the brook at the dark join of the cleft would be like dying and that if i die i will never pardon time i think my words will echo only in my own mind forever to what purpose i do not know i see a firefly trapped inside the screen i have no name for any of this i know it clearly in the same way i know the dead cry of the starlings in the eaves the smell of after rain the warm air holding in the hollows of the roads for this there is no name the holding mind is likewise without name that is the final thought it is the disorder the reason for all this the clouds begin to reach up blood mountain and i am sitting on a farmhouse porch and there are trees and it is late and i am dreaming that i dream i stare down into a fouled well and see the white legbones of a deer and the water’s surface matte with loose hair the green stink welling and bellying from the fertile sump up and flowing outwards in a fountaining current of vines and melons and leaves and the knotgrass lawns blossoming with gilliflowers shoulderhigh cloudhigh the sun finally smothering in grass and then in the entire silence of this growth the grasses thickening darkening becoming clouds reaching up from the ridges and all night  there is rain i dream that when i awaken it is a shining milky day four roosters are crowing in the yard and geese dabble in the green soft muds of the ditches this is the literal surface and for all the extravagance of what has gone before i now repent and make an image all of vermont each night blazes with fireflies the comet is a faint green phosphorescence to the north the catalpas blossom and each noon the sunlight hardens and the sky is a clear ground and i can look from my open doorway into dry and fiery yards you see i draw back always i cannot be understoodo i wud slepe all the swete darkemans nor ever speke

 i want a red dress i want it flimsy and cheap i want it too tight i want to wear it until someone tears it off me i want it sleeveless and backless this dress so no one has to guess what’s underneath i want to walk down the street past thrifty’s and the hardware store with all those keys glittering in the window past mr and mrs wong selling dayold donuts in their café past the guerra brothers slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders i want to walk like i’m the only woman on earth and i can have my pick i want that red dress bad i want it to confirm your worst fears about me to show you how little i care about you or anything except what i want when i find it i’ll pull that garment from its hanger like i’m choosing a body to carry me into this world through the birthcries and the lovecries too and i’ll wear it like bones like skin it’ll be the goddamned dress they bury me in

 tonight i will remember the model with the wide sad mouth who used to pose for father because i love the dangers of memory the boarded window and door rooms where one bare bulb makes shadows swell up the wall and yet i recall only vaguely the way her hem rustled on the floor like sand against tin laissemoi tranquille epicier it said because i want it to say something memorable i want her back that brilliant farfetched woman who drank coffee in our garden and the days father fed me absinthe through a sugar cube so i would be asleep by noon and wake to find ramona posing naked with a tambourine tonight the whole world is a garden in which the immortal whispers something about art and its opportunities memory like a bolt of silk in a tailor’s arms can be made into anything especially misfortune especially the year ramona spent in a wrath almost biblical and so far from the world not even the moon could find her study in paris where the doors opened to the river

 when from my counted days i think of times still owed to me by tyrant love and my temples anticipate a frost beyond the tribulation of my years i see love’s counterfeit joys are a poison reason sips from a glass raised to those for whom hunger dare appear in the guise of my honeyed daydream what potion of forgetting pleases reason that by neglect of its duty so toils against itself for satisfaction but my affliction seeks solace measure of the desire to be remedied and the desire to overcome it love’s remedy  ………………………………………………………………  cuando imagino de mis breves días los muchos que el tirano amor me debe y en mi cabello anticipar la nieve más que en los años las tristezas mías  veo que son sus falsas alegrías veneno que en cristal la razón bebe por quien el apetito se le atreve vestido de mis dulces fantasías  ¿qué hierbas del olvido ha dado el gusto a la razón que sin hacer su oficio quiere contra razón satisfacelle  mas consolarse quiere mi disgusto que es el deseo del remedio indicio y el remedio de amor querer vencelle  lope de vega 15621635

 when you are old and grey and full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft look your eyes had once and of their shadows deep  how many loved your moments of glad grace and loved your beauty with love false or true but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you and loved the sorrows of your changing face  and bending down beside the glowing bars murmur a little sadly how love fled and paced upon the mountains overhead and hid his face amid a crowd of stars

 for my father 1 today  today this moment speechlessly in pain he fights the terror of being poured out the fall into darkness unquenchably long so that even as he hurtles he keeps holding  back like a dam the flood overtopsbut nothing now can stop that surge already he swirls to the source of voices the many throats inside the one throat each swallowing the unstoppable flood   and as if that all along were what hed wanted he hears the voices begin to die down the way a marsh in spring pulsing and shrilling sunup to sundown falls gradually still  unappeasable the silence that will follow when his every last drop has been poured out   2 countdown  in your hospital bed the plastic mask across your face siphoning air into your lungs you lie helpless as an astronaut blasting into space eyes oblivious  to ours your bodys fevered presence shimmers like the phantom heat that will trail up the pipe of the crematory oven how distant we will seem after  such intensity  we drift in your stare like the dust stirred by the cow your parents gave you as a boy to teach responsibility  already you are space immeasurable by your slide rule your graphs that plotted payload liftoff escape velocity   3 prayer  in the house of the dead i pace the halls the walls collapsing stretch away in desert or flatten into horizonless ocean i step outside the door clicking shut  comforting in its finality  now i see the house as if i looked down from far off mountains and saw you crouching in the sunscoured yard eyes keenly focused  pupils narrowing to a cats green slits i cant look you in the face you see only the openness of sky rising above mountains  only after the world had emptied you and filled you with its openness will i feel the love i pray to feel   4 the god  a dream   a warming pulsing flood like blood surging through veins and now the god stirs in my hands dull as stone in this gravityless nowhere sensation shivering through me deliberate and sure  i cradle you i sponge you clean as if you were my son the emptiness you drink like heavy black milk erasing your wrinkles and gouged lines of pain  the god bends me to the work my fingers driven by the god blinded by the gods neutrality until i pull apart the threads in this place the god commands  face wholly unwoven without heart mind you are nothing in my hands but my hands moving   5 his stare  absently there in a moment of pure being he sits in his chair eyes locked staring the airs transparence gains solidity from his looking while his emaciated features  the way his flesh sags from sharpening cheekbones make the summer air weigh like marble on the harsh green of the trees he is too weak to prune and yet the contemplative distance he is sealed in  projects with ferocious purpose the will of his body to withdraw into this eerily removed contemplation like one who has heard a tuning fork ringing and enters and becomes each spectral vibration  so utterly absorbed that love is a distraction even the world its barest colors bleeding away before that stare   6 the current  the numbing current of the demorol sweeps him out to sea where the secret night he lives in slowly begins to darken his daytime routine of watching his blood cycle  through the tubes of a machine shadowed by blackness blinding as an underwater cave already he filters the dark water through gills aligned to strain that element he more and more resembles  like walls of water held in miraculous suspension the moment of his death looms impartially above him my hands holding his tightening its grip even as his hand loosens   as if my hand could lead him past that undulating weight towering above us out of sight   7 the rehearsal  i lead you back your orpheus until you stand inhaling on the topmost stair the rank rich air of breathing flesh but like fumes rising from earths molten core  the voices of the dead reach out to you your whispering parents dead for forty years entreating me to turnand so i turn as must you your footsteps die  you dwindle blur into unfillable space echoing like the dark of a cathedral  but there is no dark no stair no orpheus  only this voice rehearsing breath by breath in words youll never read these lines stolen from your death

 we stopped at a farmer’s house before parking at the dock that creaked over the river rowboats for rent five bucks an hour twenty for the day deep water i knew a canvas bag  was in the trunk i knew lunch would be roast beef sandwiches and hot stew from a thermos chunks of carrot and potatoes cut by my mother who slept through the racket of our leaving  while my father paid i loaded the boat with our poles and tackle boxes lead sinkers shaped like grey pears raincoats and a case of beer i was ten and i knew my dad would toss  that canvas bag into the aluminum boat with a thunk we fish for gar with kittens he’d yelled last night at my mother and that was that the rowboat slid from the dock the occasional clunk of the first  sixpack clipped on the fish stringer and i knew that i should take my time fastening the wire leader to the brass swivel tying on those massive sinkers i knew that the sixinch treble hook  would tremble in my hands and when i was done i knew what came next a canvas bag stiff kittens blood i tore two hooks through the side of a calico yanked upward with a  sharp tug to lodge the third barb beneath the ribs i dangled my fingers in cold water to wash them then reared the rod back into a cast that splashed twenty feet from the boat  he popped the third beer and finished baiting his hook too deep for an anchor we drifted and far beneath the gar cruised back and forth their prehistoric snouts slicing the dark bumping  our bait again and again until that fierce hunger i was learning said clamp down and take it

 the mower alone saw from the median the cloud come over the mountain down to trawl the valley like a whale and the swifts like water passing through her white baleen  the mower alone patrolling the haw with the hawks saw from the median the cloud come over the mountain to swallow where the sky had been and where the town had been pinned by steeples and hummed electric hubris  for everyone else on either side of the narrow the cloud was only a minute of a single verse because the highway treats the blues as all the same as if bentonia were sunflower county but the land between the lanes even while under the blades sees the power in every cloud and hears each song spiral out of an old familiar tune just so to devour our hearts

 when you come as you soon must to the streets of our city madeyed from stating the obvious not proclaiming our fall but begging us in god’s name to have selfpity  spare us all word of the weapons their force and range the long numbers that rocket the mind our slow unreckoning hearts will be left behind unable to fear what is too strange  nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race how should we dream of this place without us the sun mere fire the leaves untroubled about us a stone look on the stone’s face  speak of the world’s own change though we cannot conceive of an undreamt thing we know to our cost how the dreamt cloud crumbles the vines are blackened by frost how the view alters we could believe  if you told us so that the whitetailed deer will slip into perfect shade grown perfectly shy the lark avoid the reaches of our eye the jackpine lose its knuckled grip  on the cold ledge and every torrent burn as xanthus once its gliding trout stunned in a twinkling what should we be without the dolphin’s arc the dove’s return  these things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken ask us prophet how we shall call our natures forth when that live tongue is all dispelled that glass obscured or broken  in which we have said the rose of our love and the clean horse of our courage in which beheld the singing locust of the soul unshelled and all we mean or wish to mean  ask us ask us whether with the worldless rose our hearts shall fail us come demanding whether there shall be lofty or long standing when the bronze annals of the oaktree close

 nondum amabam et amare amabam quaerebam quid amarem amans amare confess st august earth ocean air belovèd brotherhood if our great mother has imbued my soul with aught of natural piety to feel your love and recompense the boon with mine if dewy morn and odorous noon and even with sunset and its gorgeous ministers and solemn midnights tingling silentness if autumns hollow sighs in the sere wood and winter robing with pure snow and crowns of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs if springs voluptuous pantings when she breathes her first sweet kisses have been dear to me if no bright bird insect or gentle beast i consciously have injured but still loved and cherished these my kindred then forgive this boast belovèd brethren and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now  mother of this unfathomable world favour my solemn song for i have loved thee ever and thee only i have watched thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger to render up the tale of what we are in lone and silent hours when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses made such magic as compels the charmèd night to render up thy chargeand though neer yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary enough from incommunicable dream and twilight phantasms and deep noonday thought has shone within me that serenely now and moveless as a longforgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane i wait thy breath great parent that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air and motions of the forests and the sea and voice of living beings and woven hymns of night and day and the deep heart of man  there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built oer his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness a lovely youthno mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath the lone couch of his everlasting sleep gentle and brave and generousno lorn bard breathed oer his dark fate one melodious sigh he lived he died he sung in solitude strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes and virgins as unknown he passed have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn and silence too enamoured of that voice locks its mute music in her rugged cell  by solemn vision and bright silver dream his infancy was nurtured every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air sent to his heart its choicest impulses the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips and all of great or good or lovely which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates he felt and knew when early youth had past he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes from savage men his rest and food natures most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued whereer the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge or where the secret caves rugged and dark winding among the springs of fire and poison inaccessible to avarice or pride their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls frequent with crystal column and clear shrines of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder he would linger long in lonesome vales making the wild his home until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food lured by the gentle meaning of his looks and the wild antelope that starts wheneer the dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own  his wandering step obedient to high thoughts has visited the awful ruins of the days of old athens and tyre and balbec and the waste where stood jerusalem the fallen towers of babylon the eternal pyramids memphis and thebes and whatsoeer of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx dark æthiopia in her desert hills conceals among the ruined temples there stupendous columns and wild images of more than man where marble daemons watch the zodiacs brazen mystery and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around he lingered poring on memorials of the worlds youth through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task but ever gazed and gazed till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time  meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food her daily portion from her fathers tent and spread her matting for his couch and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps enamoured yet not daring for deep awe to speak her loveand watched his nightly sleep sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose then when red morn made paler the pale moon to her cold home wildered and wan and panting she returned  the poet wandering on through arabie and persia and the wild carmanian waste and oer the aërial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves in joy and exultation held his way till in the vale of cashmire far within its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs a vision on his sleep there came a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek he dreamed a veilèd maid sate near him talking in low solemn tones her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought its music long like woven sounds of streams and breezes held his inmost sense suspended in its web of manycoloured woof and shifting hues knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme and lofty hopes of divine liberty thoughts the most dear to him and poesy herself a poet soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire wild numbers then she raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos her fair hands were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song sudden she rose as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen at the sound he turned and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind her outspread arms now bare her dark locks floating in the breath of night her beamy bending eyes her parted lips outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath and spread his arms to meet her panting bosomshe drew back a while then yielding to the irresistible joy with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night involved and swallowed up the vision sleep like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain  roused by the shock he started from his trance the cold white light of morning the blue moon low in the west the clear and garish hills the distinct valley and the vacant woods spread round him where he stood whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight the sounds that soothed his sleep the mystery and the majesty of earth the joy the exultation his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as oceans moon looks on the moon in heaven the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade he overleaps the bounds alas alas were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously lost lost for ever lost in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep that beautiful shape does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise o sleep does the bright arch of rainbow clouds and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake lead only to a black and watery depth while deaths blue vault with loathliest vapours hung where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day conduct o sleep to thy delightful realms this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair  while daylight held the sky the poet kept mute conference with his still soul at night the passion came like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream and shook him from his rest and led him forth into the darknessas an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent feels her breast burn with the poison and precipitates through night and day tempest and calm and cloud frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight oer the wide aëry wilderness thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream beneath the cold glare of the desolate night through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells startling with careless step the moonlight snake he fled red morning dawned upon his flight shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death he wandered on till vast aornos seen from petras steep hung oer the low horizon like a cloud through balk and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust wildly he wandered on day after day a weary waste of hours bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame and now his limbs were lean his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin life and the lustre that consumed it shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone the cottagers who ministered with human charity his human wants beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant the mountaineer encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes and eager breath and feet disturbing not the drifted snow had paused in its career the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mothers robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes to remember their strange light in many a dream of aftertimes but youthful maidens taught by nature would interpret half the woe that wasted him would call him with false names brother and friend would press his pallid hand at parting and watch dim through tears the path of his departure from their fathers door  at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes a strong impulse urged his steps to the seashore a swan was there beside a sluggish stream among the reeds it rose as he approached and with strong wings scaling the upward sky bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main his eyes pursued its flightthou hast a home beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy and what am i that i should linger here with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned to beauty wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven that echoes not my thoughts a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips for sleep he knew kept most relentlessly its precious charge and silent death exposed faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms  startled by his own thoughts he looked around there was no fair fiend near him not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze it had been long abandoned for its sides gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear oceans waste for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep  the day was fair and sunny sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance and the wind swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves following his eager soul the wanderer leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast and took his lonely seat and felt the boat speed oer the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane  as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boata whirlwind swept it on with fierce gusts and precipitating force through the white ridges of the chafèd sea the waves arose higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempests scourge like serpents struggling in a vultures grasp calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast descending and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course he sate as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those belovèd eyes the poet sate holding the steady helm evening came on the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path oer the waste deep twilight ascending slowly from the east entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks oer the fair front and radiant eyes of day night followed clad with stars on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of oceans mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock the calm and spangled sky the little boat still fled before the storm still fled like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river now pausing on the edge of the riven wave now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell convulsing ocean safely fled as if that frail and wasted human form had been an elemental god  at midnight the moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs of caucasus whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound for everwho shall save the boat fled onthe boiling torrent drove the crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms the shattered mountain overhung the sea and faster still beyond all human speed suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave the little boat was driven a cavern there yawned and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea the boat fled on with unrelaxing speedvision and love the poet cried aloud i have beheld the path of thy departure sleep and death shall not divide us long  the boat pursued the windings of the cavern daylight shone at length upon that gloomy rivers flow now where the fiercest war among the waves is calm on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly where the mountain riven exposed those black depths to the azure sky ere yet the floods enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus with sound that shook the everlasting rocks the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm stair above stair the eddying waters rose circling immeasurably fast and laved with alternating dash the gnarlèd roots of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it i the midst was left reflecting yet distorting every cloud a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm seized by the sway of the ascending stream with dizzy swiftness round and round and round ridge after ridge the straining boat arose till on the verge of the extremest curve where through an opening of the rocky bank the waters overflow and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left the boat paused shudderingshall it sink down the abyss shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it now shall it falla wandering stream of wind breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail and lo with gentle motion between banks of mossy slope and on a placid stream beneath a woven grove it sails and hark the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods where the embowering trees recede and leave a little space of green expanse the cove is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes reflected in the crystal calm the wave of the boats motion marred their pensive task which nought but vagrant bird or wanton wind or falling speargrass or their own decay had eer disturbed before the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair but on his heart its solitude returned and he forbore not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry it hung upon his life as lightning in a cloud gleams hovering ere it vanish ere the floods of night close over it  the noonday sun now shone upon the forest one vast mass of mingling shade whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms there huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks mocking its moans respond and roar for ever the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight oer the poets path as led by love or dream or god or mightier death he sought in natures dearest haunt some bank her cradle and his sepulchre more dark and dark the shades accumulate the oak expanding its immense and knotty arms embraces the light beech the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching frame most solemn domes within and far below like clouds suspended in an emerald sky the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale like restless serpents clothed in rainbow and in fire the parasites starred with ten thousand blossoms flow around the grey trunks and as gamesome infants eyes with gentle meanings and most innocent wiles fold their beams round the hearts of those that love these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union the woven leaves make network of the dark blue light of day and the nights noontide clearness mutable as shapes in the weird clouds soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells fragrant with perfumed herbs and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful one darkest glen sends from its woods of muskrose twined with jasmine a souldissolving odour to invite to some more lovely mystery through the dell silence and twilight here twinsisters keep their noonday watch and sail among the shades like vaporous shapes half seen beyond a well dark gleaming and of most translucent wave images all the woven boughs above and each depending leaf and every speck of azure sky darting between their chasms nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair or painted bird sleeping beneath the moon or gorgeous insect floating motionless unconscious of the day ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon  hither the poet came his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there he heard the motion of the leaves the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose a spirit seemed to stand beside himclothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that wasonly when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness two eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him  obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dellthe rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound now on the polished stones it danced like childhood laughing as it went then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietnesso stream whose source is inaccessibly profound whither do thy mysterious waters tend thou imagest my life thy darksome stillness thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs thy searchless fountain and invisible course have each their type in me and the wide sky and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i the passing wind  beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever he did move yet not like him forgetful of the grave where when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent he must descend with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet and now the forests solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed the struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope and nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil a gradual change was here yet ghastly for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone gleam stony orbsso from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions calm he still pursued the stream that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed on every side now rose rocks which in unimaginable forms lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening and its precipice obscuring the ravine disclosed above mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream lo where the pass expands its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams dim tracts and vast robed in the lustrous gloom of leadencoloured even and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight on the verge of the remote horizon the near scene in naked and severe simplicity made contrast with the universe a pine rockrooted stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast yielding one only response at each pause in most familiar cadence with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river foaming and hurrying oer its rugged path fell into that immeasurable void scattering its waters to the passing winds  yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent were not allone silent nook was there even on the edge of that vast mountain upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth and the bending vault of stars it was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms and did embower with leaves for ever green and berries dark the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore in wanton sport those bright leaves whose decay red yellow or ethereally pale rivals the pride of summer tis the haunt of every gentle wind whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity one step one human step alone has ever broken the stillness of its solitudeone voice alone inspired its echoeseven that voice which hither came floating among the winds and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions render up its majesty scatter its music on the unfeeling storm and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss commit the colours of that varying cheek that snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes  the dim and hornèd moon hung low and poured a sea of lustre on the horizons verge that overflowed its mountains yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank wan moonlight even to fulness not a star shone not a sound was heard the very winds dangers grim playmates on that precipice slept clasped in his embraceo storm of death whose sightless speed divides this sullen night and thou colossal skeleton that still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence art king of this frail world from the red field of slaughter from the reeking hospital the patriots sacred couch the snowy bed of innocence the scaffold and the throne a mighty voice invokes thee ruin calls his brother death a rare and regal prey he hath prepared prowling around the world glutted with which thou mayst repose and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart  when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderers footsteps fell he knew that death was on him yet a little ere it fled did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past that paused within his passive being now like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head his limbs did rest diffused and motionless on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasmand thus he lay surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life hope and despair the torturers slept no mortal pain or fear marred his repose the influxes of sense and his own being unalloyed by pain yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed the stream of thought till he lay breathing there at peace and faintly smilinghis last sight was the great moon which oer the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle now upon the jaggèd hills it rests and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk the poets blood that ever beat in mystic sympathy with natures ebb and flow grew feebler still and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate nighttill the minutest ray was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart it pausedit fluttered but when heaven remained utterly black the murky shades involved an image silent cold and motionless as their own voiceless earth and vacant air even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight ere the west eclipses it was now that wondrous frame no sense no motion no divinity a fragile lute on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wandera bright stream once fed with manyvoicèd wavesa dream of youth which night and time have quenched for ever still dark and dry and unremembered now  o for medeas wondrous alchemy which wheresoeer it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance o that god profuse of poisons would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained who now vessel of deathless wrath a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears over the world wanders for ever lone as incarnate death o that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay were the true law of this so lovely world but thou art fled like some frail exhalation which the dawn robes in its golden beamsah thou hast fled the brave the gentle and the beautiful the child of grace and genius heartless things are done and said i the world and many worms and beasts and men live on and mighty earth from sea and mountain city and wilderness in vesper low or joyous orison lifts still its solemn voicebut thou art fled thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene who have to thee been purest ministers who are alas now thou art not upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence on those eyes that image sleep in death upon that form yet safe from the worms outrage let no tear be shednot even in thought nor when those hues are gone and those divinest lineaments worn by the senseless wind shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain let not high verse mourning the memory of that which is no more or paintings woe or sculpture speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers art and eloquence and all the shows o the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade it is a woe too deep for tears when all is reft at once when some surpassing spirit whose light adorned the world around it leaves those who remain behind not sobs or groans the passionate tumult of a clinging hope but pale despair and cold tranquillity natures vast frame the web of human things birth and the grave that are not as they were

 winter sea over my shoes shadows and bright round stones at san gregorio  every wave turns a season forests adrift empty shells memory of fire so faraway in the mountains and canyons  silent pools raise my faces by early tide slight my hand shoulders almost ashore  light breaks over the plovers certain steps my traces blood bone stone turn natural and heavy waves rush the sand

 from sonnets second series   xviii  and change with hurried hand has swept these scenes the woods have fallen across the meadowlot the hunter’s trail and trappath is forgot and fire has drunk the swamps of evergreens yet for a moment let my fancy plant these autumn hills againthe wild dove’s haunt the wild deer’s walk in golden umbrage shut the indian river runs quonecktacut here but a lifetime back where falls tonight behind the curtained pane a sheltered light on buds of rose or vase of violet aloft upon the marble mantel set here in the forestheart hung blackening the wolfbait on the bush beside the spring

 last night tossed in my bed the sound of the rain turned me around a leaf in a dried gully from side to side the sound of the rain took me apart        opened to                 what is it breath caught in memory of a deep sweetness that sound unceasing delicate                the wetness running through my body it might be nighttime in a forest hut the rain constant in little rivulets splashing at times uncertain safe in each others arms the rain sheltering us       a depth opening bottomless to a terrible sweetness the small rain shaking us in our bed the terror whispering end of a season wind from the west new york 1982

 we called off the search and the weary climbed down from the glacier with their dogs exhausted in the spring sun too tired to eat the ice in their paws  we had called his name mostly for show a ritual that kept us moving in the high bowls their stunted pines predating the flood in the steep ravines sliding loose with scree loudly at first then speaking it to each other then spelling it out on forms required by law  it is a form of praying he claimed to walk out to the very edge of your life every time the reply comes clear as a stone at our thin crowns it misses almost every time humming as it goes

 there might be the quibble of birds and the swag of a river and a distantly belled altar of animals softly spoken certainly cattail sumac and fern would rise from the marshes nearby revealed in forms too perfect to envy trees not trying for larger and larger keepsakes  cryptic and subtle green hedgerows hiding mysterious deer the start of a rabbit as if towers and clouds had suddenly shadowed an open field these would be the events of the day life having narrowed down to please natural hungers and thirsts the grass thick at our feet and above our heads the stars their fireworks anemones  what shall i say of the house or you only industrious ghosts would know how lazily cropping up the view would make the impossible possible nothing but weekdays would blankly graze on time’s oblivious pastures free at last of motive and thought and we becoming ourselves so naturally would never say looking up at the sky another life is shining in the sky

 below the gardens and the darkening pines the living water sinks among the stones sinking yet foaming till the snowy tones merge with the fog drawn landward in dim lines the cloud dissolves among the flowering vines and now the definite mountainside disowns the fluid world the immeasurable zones then white oblivion swallows all designs  but still the rich confusion of the sea unceasing voice sombre and solacing rises through veils of silence past the trees in restless repetition bound yet free wave after wave in deluge fresh releasing an ancient speech hushed in tremendous ease

 the cave looked much like any other from a little distance but as we approached came almost to its mouth we saw its walls within that slanted up into a dome were beating like a wild black lung it was plastered and hung with the pulsing bodies of bats the organ music of the body’s deep interior alive the sacred cave with its ten thousand gleaming eyes near the clustered rocks where the sea beat with the leather wings of its own dark waves  below the bathung throbbing walls an altar stood glittering with guano a stucco sculpture like a gaudi church berserk baroque stone translated into fluxmurk and mud and the floral extravagance of wet sand dripped from a giant hand giving back blessing excrementreturn for the first fruits offered to the gods  we stayed outside superior with fear like tourists peering through a door whose hanging beads rattle in the air from one who disappeared into the dim interior we thought of the caves of marabar of a writer who entered and never quite emerged the caves’ echoing black emptiness a tunnel in the english soul where he is wandering still so the bat cave on the bali coast not far from denpasar holds us off and beckons   standing there now at the mouth of the cavethis time we enter feel inside the flutter of those many hearts the radiant heat of pumping veins the stretch of wing on bone like a benediction and the familiar faces of this manyheaded god benevolent as night is to the wearythe way at dark the cave releases them all how they must lift like the foam on a wave breaking how many they are as they enter the starlit air and scatter in wild wide arcs in search of fruit the sweet bites of mosquito   while the great domes of our own kind slide open the eye that watches tracks the skies and the huge doors roll slowly back on the hangars the planes push out their noses of steel their wings a bright alloy of aluminum and death they roar down the runways tear into the night their heavy bodies fueled from sucking at the hidden veins of earth they leave a trail of fire behind them as they scar the air filling the dreams of children sleepinganywhere chicago baghdadwith blood as the bombs drop as the world splits open as the mothers reach for their own in the night of the falling sky madness in method nature gone into reverse   here nearly unperturbed the bats from the sacred cave fill the night with their calls highpitched tuned to the solid world as eyes to the spectrum of light gnats to the glow of a lampthe bats circle the clouds wheel the earth turns pulling the dome of stars among the spinning trees blurring the sweet globes of fruit shaped exactly to desiredizzy we swing back to the cave on our stiff dark wings the sweet juice of papaya drying on our jaws home to the cave to attach ourselves back to the pulsing dome until hanging there sated and sleepy we can see what was once our world upside down as it is and wonder whose altars those are white encrusted with shit

 reading in bed full of sentiment for the mild evening and the children asleep in adjacent rooms hearing them cry out now and then the brief reports of sufficient imagination and listening at the same time compassionately to the scrabble of claws the fast treble in the chimney then it was out not a trapped bird beating at the seams of the ceiling but a bat lifting toward us falling away  dominion over every living thing large brain a choice of weapons

 by the time i recalled that it is also terrifying we had gone too far into the charmed woods to return it was then  the beautiful animal appeared in our path ribs jutting moonfed eyes moving from me to you and back if we show  none of the fear it may tire of waiting for the triggering flight it may ask only to lie between us and sleep fur warm  on our skin breath sweet on our necks as it dreams of slaughter as we dream alternately of feeding and taming it  and of being the first to run the woods close tight around us lying nested here like spoons in a drawer of knives to see  who wakes first and from which dream

 pei designed the building with views smooth masonry and the mountains aligned for a photo opportunity inside are files sufficient for forever for fine tuning weather  great spangled fritillary the watcher vaguely recalls from teach yourself lepidoptery a book he wanted to live in a land of appropriate weather with views of mountains and with music constant  he wants to tell a story but no one would listen like opera black women clean the floors and shine the walls like silver nightly computers whir platonic as nuns nothing  escapes naming storms arranged in teacups like anyone’s collection like rows of butterflies pinned and satisfactory this is the new landscape or there is a lewd father among the shrubbery  watching daughters in weather he breathes heavily and the wet wisdom begins the storm gathering to spill across the ridge longed for daughters must be warned against sincerity  of frantic violins “he was a man of sympathetic tendencies” read the official report “he was smaller than he looked and tended to lick chocolate from his fingers in a lascivious manner”  he tried his wife’s patience it is true and lived alone through the marriage kept his own counsel with such petty symbols as weather he kept his own counsel  a butterfly like weather the climate like laughter the movement of small air clouds too have names clouds leave home to find themselves good money after bad the fathers say and close  the door called nature against their coming back the funny little ways children have of making the world the color they always wanted sunset birds the mathematics of memory begin  to swirl like cookie dough like chocolate with egg and sugar and vanilla and butter a bowl to lick dangerous with delight as ultraviolet home again begs the mother and soon the sorry child walks  that long allée as rain begins to pour   past such petty symbols the boy returns through architecture a silly gauntlet the butterfly the mother the fit signatures of loveliness his parents at the door  the little cottage in the woods hansel home again at last the shining path a little like a dream ours is not a simple age and things are what they seem happily ever after in the malicious tiny rain

 a striped blouse in a clearing by bazille is you may say a patroness of boughs too queenly kind toward nature to be kin but ceremony never did conceal save to the silly eye which all allows how much we are the woods we wander in  let her be some sabrina fresh from stream lucent as shallows slowed by wading sun bedded on fern the flowers’ cynosure then nymph and wood must nod and strive to dream that she is airy earth the trees undone must ape her languor natural and pure  hohum i am for wit and wakefulness and love this feigning lady by bazille whats lightly hid is deepest understood and when with social smile and formal dress she teaches leaves to curtsey and quadrille i think there are most tigers in the wood

 i lived here nearly 5 years before i could meet the middle western day with anything approaching dignity it’s a place that lets you understand why the bible is the way it is proud people cannot live here  the land’s too flat ugly sullen and big it pounds men down past humbleness they stoop at 35 possibly cringing from the heavy and terrible sky in country like this there can be no god but jahweh  in the mills and refineries of its south side chicago passes its natural gas in flames bouncing like bunsens from stacks a hundred feet high the stench stabs at your eyeballs the whole sky green and yellow backdrop for the skeleton steel of a bombedout town  remember the movies in grammar school the goggled men doing strong things in showers of steelspark the dark screen cracking light and the furnace door opening with a blast of orange like a sunset or an orange  it was photographed by a fairy thrilled as a girl or a nazi who wished there were people behind that door hence the remote beauty but sievers whose old man spent most of his life in there remembers a “nigger in a red tshirt pissing into the black sand”  it was 5 years until i could afford to recognize the ferocity friends helped me then i put some love into my house finally i found some quiet lakes and a farm where they let me shoot pheasant  standing in the boat one night i watched the lake go absolutely flat smaller than raindrops and only here and there the feeding rings of fish were visible a hundred yards away  and the blue gill caught that afternoon lifted from its northern lake like a tropical jewel at its ear belly gold so bright you’d swear he had a light in there his color faded with his life a small green fish     all things considered it’s a gentle and undemanding planet even here far gentler here than any of a dozen other places the trouble is always and only with what we build on top of it  there’s nobody else to blame you can’t fix it and you can’t make it go away it does no good appealing to some illinvented thunderer brooding above some unimaginable crag     it’s ours right down to the last small hinge it all depends for its existence only and utterly upon our sufferance  driving back i saw chicago rising in its gases and i knew again that never will the man be made to stand against this pitiless unparalleled monstrocity it snuffles on the beach of its great lake like a blind red rhinoceros it’s already running us down  you can’t fix it you can’t make it go away i don’t know what you’re going to do about it but i know what i’m going to do about it i’m just going to walk away from it maybe a small part of it will die if i’m not around  feeding it anymore

 for a month now wandering over the sierras a poem had been gathering in my mind details of significance and rhythm the way poems do but still lacking a focus last night i remembered the date and it all began to grow together and take on purpose we sat up late while deneb moved over the zenith and i told marie all about boston how it looked that last terrible week how hundreds stood weeping impotent in the streets that last midnight i told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands how america was forever a different place afterwards for many in the morning we swam in the cold transparent lake the blue damsel flies on all the reeds like millions of narrow metallic flowers and i thought of you behind the grille in dedham vanzetti saying “who would ever have thought we would make this history” crossing the brilliant milesquare meadow illuminated with asters and cyclamen the pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting with the shifting wind over it and the blue and sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind i saw you in the sour prison light saying “goodbye comrade” in the basin under the crest where the pines end and the sierra primrose begins a party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle the bottle stayed on its rock nobody could hit it looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake the pattern of human beings seemed simpler than the diagonals of water and stone climbing the chute up the melting snow and broken rock i remembered what you said about sacco how it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record traversing below the ragged arête one cheek pressed against the rock the wind slapping the other i saw you both marching in an army you with the red and black flag sacco with the rattlesnake banner i kicked steps up the last snow bank and came to the indescribably blue and fragrant polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit these are the things that will last a long time vanzetti i am glad that once on your day i have stood among them some day mountains will be named after you and sacco they will be here and your name with them “when these days are but a dim remembering of the time when man was wolf to man” i think men will be remembering you a long time standing on the mountains many men a long time comrade

 it is windy today a wall of wind crashes against windows clunk against iron frames as wind swings past broken glass and seethes like a frightened cat in empty spaces of the cellblock  in the exercise yard we sat huddled in our prison jackets on our haunches against the fence and the wind carried our words over the fences while the vigilant guard on the tower held his cap at the sudden gust  i could see the main tower from where i sat and the wind in my face gave me the feeling i could grasp the tower like a cornstalk and snap it from its roots of rock  the wind plays it like a flute this hollow shoot of rock the brim girded with barbwire with a guard sitting there also listening intently to the sounds as clouds cover the sun  i thought of the day i was coming to prison in the back seat of a police car hands and ankles chained the policeman pointed “see that big water tank the big silver one out there sticking up that’s the prison”  and here i am i cannot believe it sometimes it is such a dream a dream where i stand up in the face of the wind like now it blows at my jacket and my eyelids flick a little bit while i stare disbelieving     the third day of spring and four years later i can tell you how a man can endure how a man can become so cruel how he can die or become so cold i can tell you this i have seen it every day every day and still i am strong enough to love you love myself and feel good even as the earth shakes and trembles and i have not a thing to my name i feel as if i have everything everything

 always the evening noises the footsteps on the stairs the day that rises in the throat a turn of the key will expel the world against the extinct forest of furniture the channeled bloodstream translates the dream into this small life  in the end we shrink until finally we can no longer inhabit the gestures of our childhood  a nail in a board the remains of a fence blurred memory of the mountain that raised the tree that brooded over its ore  modest against a hedge a spade dreams its beautiful death “simple and calm” nourished on weeds and wind the image moves distilling its own memory far off we disappear into the ochre and the gold the mudbrown and the primordial green  the slightest evidence of life in the courtyards silence the barking of that dog a shutter merely thats banging those books stacked in one corner of the room everything that ordinarily follows its automated course and there all at once the happiness that spreads its billion pinpricks through the body  evenings voice unreels its argument five floors below the courtyard and its echoes the barking still and overhead the footsteps of regret in the maids rooms ill try to have given each thing my word before giving in to sleep  the room breathes deeply the music of a quartet its that grave wellbeing unexpectedly you know nobody you may speak im not there  a gesture the garden diffuses the pale green taste of currants one remains quiet as long as possible another gesture the sun rips open the scent of the lindens childhood leaps over the wall the miracle would be having something to say  maybe we could have inhabited that smile over there at the other end of the room or else we could have met at the improbable dawn of memory maybe we could have fallen asleep in the twilight of this autumn when the brain is nothing more than oak and leather but we have only this thin life to place beneath the axe  the crows in the plowed field black against the fields ochre gleaming and black amid the smell of moist earth a smell mixed with the brush and bark and roots that the wind returns as someone somewhere burns them and then that pile of words that rots with helplessness  in the forest the sound dry and brief of a pebble in a streambed fallen after patient millennia into the earths darkness just a dry sound and its echo quickly engulfed by birdcalls and later on the path drops of blood from the trees  a farmer carriers his tools slowly toward the shed in the atmospheric silence a woodpecker registers the sound of its lifes work thats all some animals a pile of wood and the smell of rain which always calls to mind something that cant quite be reconstructed  acrid smoke and then that crackling of the woods in the clearing a few centimeters above the cut weeds the tenuous vapor of memory between eyelashes amid the colors of the woods the colors of weeds and earth that sky that patch of sky that sky  the courtyard the wood bench the sputtering of the fishpond the smell of humus the smell of mushroom five notes in the rain sketch the presence of a bird  the village the morning belong to the birds images flow freely through the alleys silence full of events the eyes prey on a shadow a gulls passing reshapes all the shores of the world  birdcalls cut through the fog wet grass morning the rectangle of a wall says “blank” nothing else on the horizon very nearby a woman dressed in black glides silently across her wide open destiny  between branches near the sun the moon which opens the night to the night i sink gently and disappear on the surface alone the cry of an owl keeps watch  the stairs the brass doorknob the smell of dark corners the iron bed the red bedspread slow breathing that song that waits for nothing but our melody  we are of the morning of the gently sloping hour that comes slowly down from the sun the old clothes in the corner are tinged with the mornings color which will have to be worn the larks song widens the silence  deep in the forest the cuckoo the woodpecker the chiaroscuro of ancient musics heavy wagons clench their signallights toward the heights of the opaque sky i moved with closed words across the homeland that sleeps me  from this far country where you respond to me without my hearing a word of yours without perhaps my words ever reaching you from this country where perhaps we understand each other i overhear the most contradictory noises which veil and deny your voice and which would like to make me believe that im speaking alone

 windy today and i feel less than brilliant driving over the hills from work there are the dark parts on the road when you pass through clumps of wood and the bright spots where you have a view of the ocean but that doesn’t make the road an allegory  i should call marie and apologize for being so boring at dinner last night but can i really promise not to be that way again and anyway i’d rather watch the trees tossing in what certainly looks like sexual arousal  otherwise it’s spring and everything looks frail the sky is baby blue and the justunfurling leaves are full of infant chlorophyll the very tint of inexperience  last summer’s song is making a comeback on the radio and on the highway overpass the only metaphysical vandal in america has written memory loves time in big black spraypaint letters  which makes us wonder if time loves memory back  last night i dreamed of x again she’s like a stain on my subconscious sheets years ago she penetrated me but though i scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed i never got her out but now i’m glad  what i thought was an end turned out to be a middle what i thought was a brick wall turned out to be a tunnel what i thought was an injustice turned out to be a color of the sky  outside the youth center between the liquor store and the police station a little dogwood tree is losing its mind  overflowing with blossomfoam like a sudsy mug of beer like a bride ripping off her clothes  dropping snow white petals to the ground in clouds  so nature’s wastefulness seems quietly obscene it’s been doing that all week making beauty and throwing it away and making more

 just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing we can hear it always earthquake starvation the everrenewing sump of corpseflesh but in this valley the snow falls silently all day and out our window we see the curtain of it shifting and folding hiding us away in our little house we see earth smoothened and beautified made like a fantasy the snowclad trees so graceful in our new bed which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost with our two cats cooker and smudgins lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners we lie loving and warm looking out from time to time “snowbound” we say we speak of the poet who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province the kingdom of cruelty where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months across the pass and drifted deep in the vale in our kitchen the maplefire murmurs in our stove we eat cheese and newmade bread and jumbo spanish olives which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeños and garlic and dill and thyme we have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh for a while we close the immense index of images that is our livesfor instance the child on the mescalero reservation in new mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family’s hut covered with sores unable to speak but of course we see the child every day we hold out our hands we touch him shyly we make offerings to his implacability no the index cannot close and how shall we survive we don’t and cannot and will never know beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable the machine like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house as big as the whole town may break through and lurch into our valley at any moment at any moment cheers baby here’s to us see how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back

 march 29 2010 every morning since the time changed i have woken to the dawn chorus and even before it sounded i dreamed of it loud unbelievably loud shameless raucous  and once i rose and twitched the curtains apart expecting the birds to be pressing in fright against the pane like passengers but the garden was empty and it was night  not a slither of light at the horizon still the birds were bawling through the mists terrible invisible a million small evangelists  how they sing as if each had pecked up a smoldering coal their throats singed and swollen with song in dissonance as befits the dark world where only travelers and the sleepless belong

 this morning between two branches of a tree beside the door epeira once again has spun and signed his tapestry and trap i test his earlywarning system and it works he scrambles forth in sable with the yellow hieroglyph that no one knows the meaning of and i remember now how yesterday at dusk the nighthawks came back as they do about this time each year grey squadrons with the slashes white on wings cruising for bugs beneath the bellied cloud now soon the monarchs will be drifting south and then the geese will go and then one day the little garden birds will not be here see how many leaves already have withered and turned a few have fallen too change is continuous on the seamless web yet moments come like this one when you feel upon your heart a signal to attend the definite announcement of an end where one thing ceases and another starts when like the spider waiting on the web you know the intricate dependencies spreading in secret through the fabric vast of heaven and earth sending their messages ciphered in chemistry to all the kinds the whisper down the bloodstream it is time

 he could not die when trees were green for he loved the time too well his little hands when flowers were seen were held for the bluebell as he was carried oer the green  his eye glanced at the whitenosed bee he knew those children of the spring when he was well and on the lea he held one in his hands to sing which filled his heart with glee  infants the children of the spring how can an infant die when butterflies are on the wing green grass and such a sky how can they die at spring  he held his hands for daisies white and then for violets blue and took them all to bed at night that in the green fields grew as childhoods sweet delight  and then he shut his little eyes and flowers would notice not birds nests and eggs caused no surprise he now no blossoms got they met with plaintive sighs  when winter came and blasts did sigh and bare were plain and tree as he for ease in bed did lie his soul seemed with the free he died so quietly

penetrate by any drug and bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh and bring it clear and fair by three days sleep whence has the man the balm that brightens all this grown man eyes the world now like a child some elders of his tribe i should premise led in their friend obedient as a sheep to bear my inquisition while they spoke now sharply now with sorrowtold the case he listened not except i spoke to him but folded his two hands and let them talk watching the flies that buzzed and yet no fool and thats a sample how his years must go look if a beggar in fixed middlelife should find a treasurecan he use the same with straitened habits and with tastes starved small and take at once to his impoverished brain the sudden element that changes things that sets the undreamedof rapture at his hand and puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust is he not such an one as moves to mirth warily parsimonious when no need wasteful as drunkenness at undue times all prudent counsel as to what befits the golden mean is lost on such an one the mans fantastic will is the mans law so herewe call the treasure knowledge say increased beyond the fleshly faculty heaven opened to a soul while yet

littleness far as i see as if in that indeed he caught prodigious import whole results and so will turn to us the bystanders in ever the same stupor note this point that we too see not with his opened eyes wonder and doubt come wrongly into play preposterously at cross purposes should his child sicken unto deathwhy look for scarce abatement of his cheerfulness or pretermission of the daily craft while a word gesture glance from that same child at play or in the school or laid asleep will startle him to an agony of fear exasperation just as like demand the reason why tis but a word object a

to bid the sun throb wide and burst all into stars as suns grown old are wont thou and the child have each a veil alike thrown oer your heads from under which ye both stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match over a mine of greek fire did ye know he holds on firmly to some thread of life it is the life to lead perforcedly which runs across some vast distracting orb of glory on either side that meagre thread which conscious of he must not enter yet the spiritual life around the earthly life the law of that is known to him as this his heart and brain move there his feet stay here so is the man perplext with impulses sudden to start off crosswise not straight on proclaiming what is right and wrong across and not along this black thread through the blaze it should be baulked by here it cannot be and oft the mans soul springs into his face as if he saw again and heard again his sage that bade him rise and he did rise something a word a tick of the blood within admonishes then back he sinks at once to ashes who was very fire before in sedulous recurrence to his trade whereby he earneth him the daily bread and studiously the humbler for that pride professedly the faultier that he knows gods secret while he holds the thread of life indeed the especial marking of the man is prone submission to the heavenly will seeing it what it is and why it is sayeth he will wait patient to the last for that same death which must restore his being to equilibrium body loosening soul divorced even now by premature full growth he will live nay it pleaseth him to live so long as god please and just how god please he even seeketh not to please god more which meaneth otherwise than as god please hence i perceive not he affects to preach the doctrine of his sect whateer it be make proselytes as madmen thirst to do how can he give his neighbour the real ground his own conviction ardent as he is call his great truth a lie why still the old be it as god please reassureth him i probed the sore as thy disciple should how beast said i this stolid carelessness sufficeth thee when rome is on her march to stamp out like a little spark thy town thy tribe thy crazy tale and thee at once he merely looked with his large eyes on me the man is apathetic you deduce contrariwise he loves both old and young able and weak affects the very brutes and birdshow say i flowers of the field as a wise workman recognizes tools in a masters workshop loving what they make thus is the man as harmless as a lamb only impatient let him do his best at ignorance and carelessness and sin an indignation which is promptly curbed as when in certain travels i have feigned to be an ignoramus in our art according to some preconceived design and happed to hear the lands practitioners steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance prattle fantastically on disease its cause and cureand i must hold my peace  thou wilt objectwhy have i not ere this sought out the sage himself the nazarene who wrought this cure inquiring at the source conferring with the frankness that befits alas it grieveth me the learned leech perished in a tumult many years ago accusedour learnings fateof wizardry rebellion to the setting up a rule and creed prodigious as described to me his death which happened when the earthquake fell prefiguring as soon appeared the loss to occult learning in our lord the sage who lived there in the pyramid alone was wrought by the mad peoplethats their wont on vain recourse as i conjecture it to his tried virtue for miraculous help how could he stop the earthquake thats their way the other imputations must be lies but take one though i loathe to give it thee in mere respect for any good mans fame and after all our patient lazarus is stark mad should we count on what he says perhaps not though in writing to a leech tis well to keep back nothing of a case this man so cured regards the curer then asgod forgive me who but god himself creator and sustainer of the world that came and dwelt in flesh on t awhile sayeth that such an one was born and lived taught healed the sick broke bread at his own house then died with lazarus by for aught i know and yet was    what i said nor choose repeat and must have so avouched himself in fact in hearing of this very lazarus who saithbut why all this of what he saith why write of trivial matters things of price calling at every moment for remark i noticed on the margin of a pool blueflowering borage the aleppo sort aboundeth very nitrous it is strange  thy pardon for this long and tedious case which now that i review it needs must seem unduly dwelt on prolixly set forth nor i myself discern in what is writ good cause for the peculiar interest and awe indeed this man has touched me with perhaps the journeys end the weariness had wrought upon me first i met him thus i crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills like an old lions cheek teeth out there came a moon made like a face with certain spots multiform manifold and menacing then a wind rose behind me so we met in this old sleepy town at unaware the man and i i send thee what is writ regard it as a chance a matter risked to this ambiguous syrianhe may lose or steal or give it thee with equal good jerusalems repose shall make amends for time this letter wastes thy time and mine till when once more thy pardon and farewell  the very god think abib

 come dear children let us away down and away below now my brothers call from the bay now the great winds shoreward blow now the salt tides seaward flow now the wild white horses play champ and chafe and toss in the spray children dear let us away this way this way  call her once before you go call once yet in a voice that she will know margaret margaret childrens voices should be dear call once more to a mothers ear  childrens voices wild with pain surely she will come again call her once and come away this way this way mother dear we cannot stay the wild white horses foam and fret margaret margaret  come dear children come away down call no more one last look at the whitewalld town and the little grey church on the windy shore then come down she will not come though you call all day come away come away  children dear was it yesterday we heard the sweet bells over the bay in the caverns where we lay through the surf and through the swell the faroff sound of a silver bell sandstrewn caverns cool and deep where the winds are all asleep where the spent lights quiver and gleam where the salt weed sways in the stream where the seabeasts ranged all round feed in the ooze of their pastureground where the seasnakes coil and twine dry their mail and bask in the brine where great whales come sailing by sail and sail with unshut eye round the world for ever and aye when did music come this way children dear was it yesterday  children dear was it yesterday call yet once that she went away once she sate with you and me on a red gold throne in the heart of the sea and the youngest sate on her knee she combd its bright hair and she tended it well when down swung the sound of a faroff bell she sighd she lookd up through the clear green sea she said i must go to my kinsfolk pray in the little grey church on the shore today t will be eastertime in the worldah me and i lose my poor soul merman here with thee i said go up dear heart through the waves say thy prayer and come back to the kind seacaves she smiled she went up through the surf in the bay children dear was it yesterday  children dear were we long alone the sea grows stormy the little ones moan long prayers i said in the world they say come i said and we rose through the surf in the bay we went up the beach by the sandy down where the seastocks bloom to the whitewalld town through the narrow paved streets where all was still to the little grey church on the windy hill from the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers but we stood without in the cold blowing airs we climbd on the graves on the stones worn with rains and we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes she sate by the pillar we saw her clear margaret hist come quick we are here dear heart i said we are long alone the sea grows stormy the little ones moan but ah she gave me never a look for her eyes were seald to the holy book loud prays the priest shut stands the door come away children call no more come away come down call no more  down down down down to the depths of the sea she sits at her wheel in the humming town singing most joyfully hark what she sings o joy o joy for the humming street and the child with its toy for the priest and the bell and the holy well for the wheel where i spun and the blessed light of the sun and so she sings her fill singing most joyfully till the spindle drops from her hand and the whizzing wheel stands still she steals to the window and looks at the sand and over the sand at the sea and her eyes are set in a stare and anon there breaks a sigh and anon there drops a tear from a sorrowclouded eye and a heart sorrowladen a long long sigh for the cold strange eyes of a little mermaiden and the gleam of her golden hair  come away away children come children come down the hoarse wind blows coldly lights shine in the town she will start from her slumber when gusts shake the door she will hear the winds howling will hear the waves roar we shall see while above us the waves roar and whirl a ceiling of amber a pavement of pearl singing here came a mortal but faithless was she and alone dwell for ever the kings of the sea  but children at midnight when soft the winds blow when clear falls the moonlight when springtides are low when sweet airs come seaward from heaths starrd with broom and high rocks throw mildly on the blanchd sands a gloom up the still glistening beaches up the creeks we will hie over banks of bright seaweed the ebbtide leaves dry we will gaze from the sandhills at the white sleeping town at the church on the hillside and then come back down singing there dwells a loved one but cruel is she she left lonely for ever the kings of the sea

 “wake to the sun” the rooster croaked first bird of the day the world lightflecked chiselled its lineaments into form where was all that fine light coming from  “trance at the wonder” the second sang whose five dry notes urged the ongoing afternoon on “why wake and stir” it asked and asked there was no answer  “live through the muddle” that from the next one not very helpful it looked like rain or fog in the offing twilight then it sang again from an oak or pine  silence how i waited for the fourth time was a negative dipped into its bath the dark a fixative that slowly made for every windowpane its window shade  no messages arrived no music bared the soul for its penitence up the stairs no hint of a footfall the night passed “croak by your hand” said the crow at last

 incurable and unbelieving in any truth but the truth of grieving  i saw a tree inside a tree rise kaleidoscopically  as if the leaves had livelier ghosts i pressed my face as close  to the pane as i could get to watch that fitful fluent spirit  that seemed a single being undefined or countless beings of one mind  haul its strange cohesion beyond the limits of my vision  over the house heavenwards of course i knew those leaves were birds  of course that old tree stood exactly as it had and would  but why should it seem fuller now and though a mans mind might endow  even a tree with some excess of life to which a man seems witness  that life is not the life of men and that is where the joy came in

 it mounts at sea a concave wall downribbed with shine and pushes forward building tall its steep incline  then from their hiding rise to sight black shapes on boards bearing before the fringe of white it mottles towards  their pale feet curl they poise their weight with a learn’d skill it is the wave they imitate keeps them so still  the marbling bodies have become half wave half men grafted it seems by feet of foam some seconds then  late as they can they slice the face in timed procession balance is triumph in this place triumph possession  the mindless heave of which they rode a fluid shelf breaks as they leave it falls and slowed loses itself  clear the sheathed bodies slick as seals loosen and tingle and by the board the bare foot feels the suck of shingle  they paddle in the shallows still two splash each other then all swim out to wait until the right waves gather

 my bands of silk and miniver momently grew heavier the black gauze was beggarly thin the ermine muffled mouth and chin i could not suck the moonlight in  harlequin in lozenges of love and hate i walked in these striped and ragged rigmaroles along the pavement my footsoles trod warily on living coals  shouldering the thoughts i loathed in their corrupt disguises clothed morality i could not tear from my ribs to leave them bare ivory in silver air  there i walked and there i raged the spiritual savage caged within my skeleton raged afresh to feel behind a carnal mesh the clean bones crying in the flesh

 a wanderer is man from his birth he was born in a ship on the breast of the river of time brimming with wonder and joy he spreads out his arms to the light rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream  as what he sees is so have his thoughts been whether he wakes where the snowy mountainous pass echoing the screams of the eagles hems in its gorges the bed of the newborn clearflowing stream whether he first sees light where the river in gleaming rings sluggishly winds through the plain whether in sound of the swallowing sea as is the world on the banks so is the mind of the man  vainly does each as he glides fable and dream of the lands which the river of time had left ere he woke on its breast or shall reach when his eyes have been closed only the tract where he sails he wots of only the thoughts raised by the objects he passes are his  who can see the green earth any more as she was by the sources of time who imagines her fields as they lay in the sunshine unworn by the plough who thinks as they thought the tribes who then roamd on her breast her vigorous primitive sons  what girl now reads in her bosom as clear as rebekah read when she sate at eve by the palmshaded well who guards in her breast as deep as pellucid a spring of feeling as tranquil as sure  what bard at the height of his vision can deem of god of the world of the soul with a plainness as near as flashing as moses felt when he lay in the night by his flock on the starlit arabian waste can rise and obey the beck of the spirit like him  this tract which the river of time now flows through with us is the plain gone is the calm of its earlier shore borderd by cities and hoarse with a thousand cries is its stream and we on its breast our minds are confused as the cries which we hear changing and shot as the sights which we see  and we say that repose has fled for ever the course of the river of time that cities will crowd to its edge in a blacker incessanter line that the din will be more on its banks denser the trade on its stream flatter the plain where it flows fiercer the sun overhead that never will those on its breast see an ennobling sight drink of the feeling of quiet again  but what was before us we know not and we know not what shall succeed  haply the river of time as it grows as the towns on its marge fling their wavering lights on a wider statelier stream may acquire if not the calm of its early mountainous shore yet a solemn peace of its own  and the width of the waters the hush of the grey expanse where he floats freshening its current and spotted with foam as it draws to the ocean may strike peace to the soul of the man on its breast as the pale waste widens around him as the banks fade dimmer away as the stars come out and the nightwind brings up the stream murmurs and scents of the infinite sea

 back when it took all day to come up from the curving broad ponds on the plains where the greenwinged jaçanas ran on the lily pads  easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges crossing villages silted in hollows in the foothills each with its limewashed church by the baked square of red earth and its talkers eating fruit under trees  turning a corner and catching sight at last of inky forests far above steep as faces with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering airy valleys opening out of them  waterfalls still roared from the folds of the mountain white and thundering and spray drifted around us swirling into the broad leaves and the waiting boughs  once i took a tin cup and climbed the sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside one of the high falls looking up step by step into the green sky from which rain was falling when i looked back from a ledge there were only dripping leaves below me and flowers  beside me the hissing cataract plunged into the trees holding on i moved closer left foot on a rock in the water right foot on a rock in deeper water at the edge of the fall then from under the weight of my right foot came a voice like a small bell singing over and over one clear treble syllable  i could feel it move i could feel it ring in my foot in my skin everywhere in my ears in my hair i could feel it in my tongue and in the hand holding the cup as long as i stood there it went on without changing  when i moved the cup still it went on when i filled the cup in the falling column still it went on when i drank it rang in my eyes through the thunder curtain  when i filled the cup again when i raised my foot still it went on and all the way down from wet rock to wet rock green branch to green branch it came with me  until i stood looking up and we drank the light water and when we went on we could still hear the sound as far as the next turn on the way over

 at the confluence of tea roses and russian sage we made a right at the curved iron fence one of my dead friends beside me explaining how trees communicated but i couldn’t understand a thing because it was all blurry  the way it gets  and though i knew him well i couldn’t say for sure now whether it was larry or phil or galway or charlie until i realized it was me talking in some kind of hebrish they spoke in my town by the delaware and it was used for code the way one of the amerindian languages was used in world war ii the germans couldn’t in a million years break since they weren’t as pragmatic irrational and inyourface as the english and americans were  i noticed the bees were digging in for a late lunch of what for them was boiled beef and horseradish or maybe it was just for me and they were bent over guzzling madly while paying no attention to the two of us or in any way tired of the nectars since it ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to  well  boiled beef to strawberryrhubarb pie and a little whisky after some of it spilled on the vanilla ice cream that underlaid the pie it had once overlaid all of this depending on the blossoms they circled over and bent down upon a cafeteria as good as the one on broadway called stanley’s i circled and bent over expending nickels dimes and quarters when the dulles brothers ran the country  it was larry i’m sure now  and what we talked about was cardboard and we were amazed that in the open spaces beside the hotel on 47th street there were four or five small cardboard “houses” both of us remembered the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags the size of a room at the sloane house on 34th street near the pennsylvania station where i put up the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase with little or no stuffing and a cardboard bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us we talked cardboard shirts from the cleaners with sheets of cardboard we drew on cardboard soles in ruined shoes we both wore when we were children cardboard hats cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon for costume dances balls is what we called them as if we were art students in paris about to swim in the nearest fountain  though what i want to  say is the bees were too busy to do us any harm and it was packs of wild dogs not swarms of bees that terrified me larry too except for one occasion when i pushed the wrong end of an old broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside of a lowlying garage roof and an angry swarm chased me through the yard and over a fence hating any form of criminal intrusion urban renewal or gentrification i who couldn’t resist intrusions who never could omnivorous as i was living on apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops who ran like hell that day larry too for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be paralyzed then eaten by larvae none of us dead ones did

 1  my soul radially whorls out to the edges of my body according to the same laws by which stars shine communicating with my body by emanation  when you see her you feel the impact of what visual can mean  invisibility comes through of deep pink or a color i see clairvoyantly  this felt sense at seeing the rose extends because light in the dna of my cells receives light frequencies of the flower as a hologram  the entire rose petals in moving air emotion of perfume records as a sphere so when i recall the emotion i touch dimensionality  from a small bud emerges a tight wound bundle of babyskin coral petals held in a half globe as if by cupped hands  then petals are innumerable loose double sumptuous unified  i look through parted fingers to soften my gaze so slow light shining off the object is filtered then with feeling i look at swift color there  its swiftness that seems still as noon light because my seeing travels at the same speed  i make a reciprocal balance between light falling on the back of my eye to optic nerve to pineal gland radiance stepping down to matter and my future self opening out from this sight  a moment extends to time passing as sense impression of a rose including new joys where imagined roses roses i havent yet seen or seen in books record as my experience  then experience is revelation because plants and people have in their cells particles of light that can become coherent that radiate out physically and also with the creativity of metaphor as in a beam of light holographically ie by intuition in which i inhale the perfume of the bourbon rose then try to separate what is scent sense and what you call memory what is emotion where in a dialogue like touching is it so vibratory and so absorbent of my attention and longing with impressions like fingerprints all over  im saying physical perception is the data of my embodiment whereas for the rose scarlet itself is matter   2  the rose communicates instantly with the woman by sight collapsing its boundaries and the woman widens her boundaries  her rate of perception slows down because of its complexity  theres a feeling of touching and being touched the shadings of color she can sense from touch  theres an affinity between awareness and blossom  the rose symbolizes the light of this selfaffinity  i come to visit drooping white cabbage roses at dusk  that corner of the garden glows with a quality of light i might see when light shines through mist or in early morning reflects off water  i stand quietly and allow this quality to permeate air around me  here with a white rose color is clairsentient this color in the process of being expressed like seeing venus in the day  walking i move in and out of negative space around which each rose is engaged and become uncertain of my physical extent as an object  look at the energy between people and plants your heart moves into depth perception for depth read speed of light  i set my intention through this sense of moving into coherence with the biophotons of a plant and generate feeling in response  a space opens and awareness gathers it in as at night my dream is colorless and weaves into the nuance  i can intentionally engage with the coherence of light beams instant as though lightless or the colored light of a dimension not yet arrived as our hearts are not outside affinity with respect to wavelength shaping meaning using the capacity for feeling to sense its potency in a rose and to cultivate interbeing with summer perfume

 the dog licks my hand as i worry about the left nipple of the woman in the bathroom  she is drying her hair the woman whose left nipple is sore we looked this evening for diagonal cuts or discoloration or bite marks from small insects that may be in our bed  it is a good bed a faithful bed a bed that won’t be hurt by the consideration we gave to the possibility of small though disproportionately strong insects in our bed  the blowdryer sounds like a jet taking off the first time i flew to brussels people began the journey happy but ended with drool on their shirts  she is drying her hair though she has never been to brussels drying her hair though she could be petting a dog drying her hair while having red thoughts about what the pain in her nipple means  i would not dry my hair in such a moment but i am bald the body of the woman has many ways to cease being the body of the woman  i have one way to be happy and she is that way  i would like to fly with her to brussels we would not be put off by the drool this is what happens when people sleep we would buy postcards of the little boy who saved brussels when he peed on a fire we would be romantic in public places  for the moment these desires can best be furthered by petting a dog  i’m also working on this theory that sometimes a part of the body just hurts that the purpose of prayer is to make the part of the body that sometimes just hurts the little toe or appendix  something vestigial or redundant something that can be jettisoned i have no reason to use the word cancer while petting a dog  here is a piece of a second during which a jet is not flying nor is it on the ground  i’m working on a theory that no one can die inside that piece of a second  if you are comforted by this thought you are welcome to keep it

 when the swordsman fell in kurosawa’s seven samurai in the gray rain in the cinemascope and the tokugawa dynasty he fell straight as a pine he fell as ajax fell in homer in chanted dactyls and the tree was so huge the woodsman returned for two days to that lucky place before he was done with the sawing and on the third day he brought his uncle  they stacked logs in the resinous air hacking the small limbs off tying those bundles separately the slabs near the root were quartered and still they were awkwardly large the logs from the midtree they halved ten bundles and four great piles of fragrant wood moons and quarter moons and half moons ridged by the saw’s tooth  the woodsman and the old man his uncle are standing in midforest on a floor of pine silt and spring mud they have stopped working because they are tired and because i have imagined no pack animal or primitive wagon they are too canny to call in neighbors and come home with a few logs after three days’ work they are waiting for me to do something or for the overseer of the great lord to come and arrest them  how patient they are the old man smokes a pipe and spits the young man is thinking he would be rich if he were already rich and had a mule ten days of hauling and on the seventh day they’ll probably be caught go home emptyhanded or worse i don’t know whether they’re japanese or mycenaean and there’s nothing i can do the path from here to that village is not translated a hero dying gives off stillness to the air a man and a woman walk from the movies to the house in the silence of separate fidelities there are limits to imagination

 how is it that the snow amplifies the silence slathers the black bark on limbs heaps along the brush rows  some deer have stood on their hind legs to pull the berries down now they are ghosts along the path snow flecked with red wine stains  this silence in the timbers a woodpecker on one of the trees taps out its story stopping now and then in the lapse of one white moment into another

 the story goes from in a rainfall to sister walking a field browned autumn and when she arrives winter has come so the old man rises from his chair picks up matches pipes and tools and walks out to begin again  the sculptures grow by the day birds in ice recognizable eagles a bear who began as a man in a moment of dance he does this in ice all winter carving at dawn carving at dusk  and sister after walking a field browned autumn arrives watches from the east window waits goes out to him in spring taps him on the shoulder and points to the pools of water hes standing over

 i hid my love when young till i couldnt bear the buzzing of a fly i hid my love to my despite till i could not bear to look at light i dare not gaze upon her face but left her memory in each place whereer i saw a wild flower lie i kissed and bade my love goodbye  i met her in the greenest dells where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells the lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye the bee kissed and went singing by a sunbeam found a passage there a gold chain round her neck so fair as secret as the wild bees song she lay there all the summer long  i hid my love in field and town till een the breeze would knock me down the bees seemed singing ballads oer the flys bass turned a lions roar and even silence found a tongue to haunt me all the summer long the riddle nature could not prove was nothing else but secret love

 i tell you that i see her still at the dark entrance of the hall one gas lamp burning near her shoulder shone also from her other side where hung the long inaccurate glass whose pictures were as troubled water an immense shadow had its hand between us on the floor and seemed to hump the knuckles nervously a giant crab readying to walk or a blanket moving in its sleep  you will remember with a smile instructed by movies to reminisce how strict her corsets must have been how the huge arrangements of her hair would certainly betray the least impassionate displacement there it was no rig for dallying and maybe only marriage could derange that queenly scaffolding as when a great ship coming home coasts in the harbor dropping sail and loosing all the tackle that had laced her in the long lanes  i know we need not draw this figure out but all that whalebone came from whales and all the whales lived in the sea in calm beneath the troubled glass until the needle drew their blood  i see her standing in the hall where the mirror’s lashed to blood and foam and the black flukes of agony beat at the air till the light blows out

 i walk’d the other day to spend my hour into a field where i sometimes had seen the soil to yield a gallant flow’r but winter now had ruffled all the bow’r and curious store i knew there heretofore  yet i whose search lov’d not to peep and peer i’ th’ face of things thought with my self there might be other springs besides this here which like cold friends sees us but once a year and so the flow’r might have some other bow’r  then taking up what i could nearest spy i digg’d about that place where i had seen him to grow out and by and by i saw the warm recluse alone to lie where fresh and green he liv’d of us unseen  many a question intricate and rare did i there strow but all i could extort was that he now did there repair such losses as befell him in this air and would ere long come forth most fair and young  this past i threw the clothes quite o’er his head and stung with fear of my own frailty dropp’d down many a tear upon his bed then sighing whisper’d “happy are the dead what peace doth now rock him asleep below”  and yet how few believe such doctrine springs from a poor root which all the winter sleeps here under foot and hath no wings to raise it to the truth and light of things but is still trod by ev’ry wand’ring clod  o thou whose spirit did at first inflame and warm the dead and by a sacred incubation fed with life this frame which once had neither being form nor name grant i may so thy steps track here below  that in these masques and shadows i may see thy sacred way and by those hid ascents climb to that day which breaks from thee who art in all things though invisibly shew me thy peace thy mercy love and ease  and from this care where dreams and sorrows reign lead me above where light joy leisure and true comforts move without all pain there hid in thee shew me his life again at whose dumb urn thus all the year i mourn

 we watched from the house as the river grew helpless and terrible in its unfamiliar body wrestling everything into it the water wrapped around trees until their lifehold was broken they went down one by one and the river dragged off their covering  nests of the herons roots washed to bones snags of soaked bark on the shoreline a whole forest pulled through the teeth of the spillway trees surfacing singly where the river poured off into arteries for fields below the reservation  when at last it was over the long removal they had all become the same dry wood we walked among them the branches whitening in the raw sun above us drifted herons alone hoarsevoiced broken settling their beaks among the hollows grandpa saidthese are the ghosts of the tree people moving among us unable to take their rest

 one cuts blocks from the abundant river hauls them house to house  one falls unseen the heart inoculated cold  against a sky still moving moving even now above the river the canal willows shimmering  across the water muskrats diving out of reach the river whispers till it freezes  a body twirling sluggishly beneath the surface as again  one stack then spreads the straw  another falters slips or puts a sliver on your tongue to feel it melting there the icelit  underworld of someone else

 she sang beyond the genius of the sea the water never formed to mind or voice like a body wholly body fluttering its empty sleeves and yet its mimic motion made constant cry caused constantly a cry that was not ours although we understood inhuman of the veritable ocean  the sea was not a mask no more was she the song and water were not medleyed sound even if what she sang was what she heard since what she sang was uttered word by word it may be that in all her phrases stirred the grinding water and the gasping wind but it was she and not the sea we heard  for she was the maker of the song she sang the everhooded tragicgestured sea was merely a place by which she walked to sing whose spirit is this we said because we knew it was the spirit that we sought and knew that we should ask this often as she sang  if it was only the dark voice of the sea that rose or even colored by many waves if it was only the outer voice of sky and cloud of the sunken coral waterwalled however clear it would have been deep air the heaving speech of air a summer sound repeated in a summer without end and sound alone but it was more than that more even than her voice and ours among the meaningless plungings of water and the wind theatrical distances bronze shadows heaped on high horizons mountainous atmospheres of sky and sea  it was her voice that made the sky acutest at its vanishing she measured to the hour its solitude she was the single artificer of the world in which she sang and when she sang the sea whatever self it had became the self that was her song for she was the maker then we as we beheld her striding there alone knew that there never was a world for her except the one she sang and singing made  ramon fernandez tell me if you know why when the singing ended and we turned toward the town tell why the glassy lights the lights in the fishing boats at anchor there as the night descended tilting in the air mastered the night and portioned out the sea fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles arranging deepening enchanting night  oh blessed rage for order pale ramon the maker’s rage to order words of the sea words of the fragrant portals dimlystarred and of ourselves and of our origins in ghostlier demarcations keener sounds

 last night the apple trees shook and gave each lettuce a heart six hard red apples broke through the greenhouse glass and landed in the middle of those eversoslightly green leaves that seem no mix of seeds and soil but of pastels and light and chalk x’s mark our oaks that are supposed to be cut down i’ve seen the neighbors frown when they look over the fence and see our espalier pear trees bowing out of shape i did like that they looked like candelabras against the wall but what’s the sense in swooning over pruning i said as much to mrs jones and i swear she threw her cane at me and walked off down the street without it has always puzzled me that people coo over bonsai trees when you can squint your eyes and shrink anything without much of a struggle ensued with some starlings and the strawberry nets so after untangling the two i took the nets off and watched birds with red beaks fly by all morning at the window i reread your letter about how the castles you flew over made crenellated shadows on the water in the rainbarrel has overflowed and made a small swamp i think the potatoes might turn out slightly damp don’t worry if there is no fog on the day you come home i will build a bonfire so the smoke will make the cedars look the way you like them to close i’m sorry there won’t be any salad and i love you

higher than dawn can freak the front of heaven with fire my thought with eyes and wings made wide makes way to find the place of souls that i desire  iii  if any place for any soul there be disrobed and disentrammelled if the might the fire and force that filled with ardent light the souls whose shadow is half the light we see survive and be suppressed not of the night this hour should show what all day hid from me  iv  night knows not neither is it shown to day by sunlight nor by starlight is it shown nor to the full moons eye nor footfall known their worlds untrodden and unkindled way nor

of death and birth even as they held the newborn shape of earth when first life trembled in her limbs and smiled here hope might think to find what hope were worth  vi  past hades past elysium past

that meet thee wheresoeer and have thy soul for sunshine and sweet air some late love of thine old live land should cling some living love of england round thee there  xv  here from her shore across her sunniest sea my soul makes question of the sun for thee and waves and beams make answer when thy feet made her ways flowerier and their flowers more sweet with childlike passage of a god to be like spray these waves cast off her foemens fleet  xvi  like foam they flung it from her and like weed its wrecks were washed from scornful shoal to shoal from rock to rock reverberate and the whole sea laughed and lightened with a deathless deed that sowed our enemies in her field for seed and made her shores fit harbourage for thy soul  xvii  then in her green south fields a poor mans child thou hadst thy short sweet fill of halfblown joy that ripens all of us for time to cloy with fullblown pain and passion ere the wild world caught thee by the fiery heart and smiled to make so swift end of the godlike boy  xviii  for thou if ever godlike foot there trod these fields of ours wert surely like a god who knows what splendour of strange dreams was shed with sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and red from hallowed windows over stone and sod on thine unbowed bright insubmissive head  xix  the shadow stayed not but the splendour stays our brother till the last of english days no day nor night on english earth shall be for ever spring nor summer junes nor mays but somewhat as a sound or gleam of thee shall come on us like morning from the sea  xx  like sunrise never wholly risen nor yet quenched or like sunset never wholly set a light to lighten as from living eyes the cold unlit close lids of one that lies dead or a ray returned from deaths far skies to fire us living lest our lives forget  xxi  for in that heaven what light of lights may be what splendour of what stars what spheres of flame sounding that none may number nor may name we know not even thy brethren yea not we whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee whose ways and thine are one way and the same  xxii  but if the riddles that in sleep we read and trust them not be flattering truth indeed as he

dawn to lightning me me likewise o our brother shalt thou see and i behold thee face to glorious face  xxvii  you twain the same swift year of manhood swept down the steep darkness and our father wept and from the gleam of apollonian tears a holier aureole rounds your memories kept most ferventfresh of all the singing spheres and aprilcoloured through all months and years  xxviii  you twain fate spared not half your fiery span the longer date fulfils the lesser man ye from beyond the dark dividing date stand smiling crowned as gods with foot on fate for stronger was your blessing than his ban and earliest whom he struck he struck too late  xxix  yet love and loathing faith and unfaith yet bind less to greater souls in unison and one desire that makes three spirits as one takes great and small as in one spiritual net woven out of hope toward what shall yet be done ere hate or love remember or forget  xxx  woven out of faith and hope and love too great to bear the bonds of life and death and fate woven out of love and hope and faith too dear to take the print of doubt and change and fear and interwoven with lines of wrath and hate bloodred with soils of many a sanguine year  xxxi  who cannot hate can love not if he grieve his tears are barren as the unfruitful rain that rears no harvest from the green seas plain and as thorns crackling this mans laugh is vain nor can

more glorious should you be  xxxiv  as fire to frost as ease to toil as dew to flowerless fields as sleep to slackening pain as hope to souls long weaned from hope again returning or as blood revived anew to drydrawn limbs and every pulseless vein even so toward us should no man be but you  xxxv  one rose before the sunrise was and one before the sunset lovelier than the sun and now the heaven is dark and bright and loud with wind and starry drift and moon and cloud and nights cry rings in straining sheet and shroud what help is ours if hope like yours be none  xxxvi  o wellbeloved our brethren if ye be then are we not forsaken this kind earth made fragrant once for all time with your birth and bright for all men with your love and worth the clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea

 he lowered his head and darted through the grass flushing a hen from off her nest then zeroing in on the dayold chicks instead of the mother whose decoy trick had failed to lure him away in the time it took for me to notice this hed broken the necks of two of the chicks and torn the skin from off their backs and heads the taste of their blood had deafened him to my commands so i went to him like an angry god and chased him away with my staff and rod inflicting a wound also in his side for him to go on licking to wash their blood from off his tongue with his own blood and then i kneeled in the grass to regard his kill while the mother keened inside the woods not far away oh what a mess they were with their heads snapped back and wings unhinged i picked up the bodies like bloody socks and prayed to the god in charge of this field for my own weakness to feel this much for slaughtered chicks for an understanding of his need to kill the most vulnerable thing whether hungry or not

 in the energy crisis my city has turned to burning angel skins i read by their light a book of elegies  a fruit fly lands on amichai i slap him flat against the page now it is an elegy for him as well  and his tomb and i am a terrible toothless god stringing blades of grass between the tongues of sheep  ash of angel fire drifts over my head falls in my coffee o holy holy holy indigestion  i bribe the coming day with open windows and freshly washed underwear hung out on the clothesline  slipping hastily over the hips of winds the winds know all you have to do is open your mouth the flies will come

 you’re right    in life’s chamber music either listen with total attention    or else switch off water    one drop can perfectly lock up these shores  the crash of waves has no gap    is like a tailored body still sitting on the rock    the lilacscented surrounding ocean still striking at a little girl’s unceasing gaze into distance  purple or white    petals are stored in the eyes all through the springtime night dark rings around the eyes keep opening    torn by where she looks far away  suffering is that waiting underwater pearl what turns old is salt    low sobbing in every wave the fierce wind is a jade bracelet on the wrist  island    like a boat sailing since the day you were born never slowing down its disconsolate speed always arriving yet underfoot drawn away by the ebbing tide  purple    wounds the turbulent closeup scene sets off white    the horizon like land cutting above snow line into fate exposing the snow flower you’ve caught for life  still wet    tears run halfway down the girl’s cheeks after so many years play the cold rain you’ve brought back a seagull plunges    then flies back up    you hear clearly this kiss

 it sifts from leaden sieves  it powders all the wood it fills with alabaster wool the wrinkles of the road   it makes an even face of mountain and of plain  unbroken forehead from the east unto the east again   it reaches to the fence  it wraps it rail by rail till it is lost in fleeces  it deals celestial vail  to stump and stack  and stem  a summer’s empty room  acres of joints where harvests were recordless but for them   it ruffles wrists of posts as ankles of a queen  then stills it’s artisans  like ghosts  denying they have been

 some of us are like trees that grow with a spiral grain as if prepared for the path of  the spirit’s journey to the world of all souls  it is not an easy path a dog stands at the opening constellation past the great helping hand  the dog wants to know did you ever harm an animal hurt any creature did you take a life you didn’t eat  this is the first on your map there is another my people made of  the great beyond that lies farther away than this galaxy  it is a world that can’t be imagined by ordinary means after this first one the next could be a map of  forever  it could be a cartography shining only at some times of  the year like a great web of finery  some spider pulled from herself to help you recall your true following your first white breath in the cold  the next door opens and old woman counts your scars she is interested in how you have been hurt and not in anything akin to sin  from between stars are the words we now refuse loneliness longing whatever suffering might follow your life into the sky  once those are gone the life you had against your own will the hope even the prayers take you one more bend around the river of sky

 a range of clouds banked up behind the peak of that apocryphal blue mountain with a wide oblique burst of late sun projecting at the east’s receding wall  a film of what the day so far has done a wind that tries to scrape the breaking waves up as they run across the bay and shatter at the foot of fluted cape  in tern and gannetprinted veils of spray and trees the wind has caught which seem too selfcontained to sway when they are blown and only move as a pleasing afterthought  no one no human presence has been known surely to venture here it takes one blackbird to disown that vagary and whistling just a few feet from his ear  to call him back again and make him be the subject in this scene the one who is required to see another day no blackbird with its song will intervene  the spray will hang its veils and the trees sway

 no eye that sees could fail to remark you like any leaf the rain leaves fixed to and flat against the barn’s gray shingle but  what leaf this time of year is so pale the pale of leaves when they’ve lost just enough green to become the green that means  loss and more loss approaching give up the flesh enough times and whatever is lost gets forgotten that was the thought that i  woke to those words in my head i rose i did not dress i left no particular body sleeping and stepping into the hour i saw  you strange sign at once transparent and impossible to entirely see through and how still the still of being unmoved and then  the still of no longer being able to be moved if i think of a heart his as i’ve found it if i think of increasingly my  own if i look at you now as from above and see the diva when she is caught in mid triumph arms halfraised the body as if  set at last free of the green sheath that has how many nightsheld her it is not without remembering another i once saw  like you except that something a bird some wild and necessary hunger had gotten to it and like the diva but now broken splayed  and torn the green torn piecemeal from her i remember the hands andhow small they seemed bringing the small ripped thing to me

 yet once more o ye laurels and once more ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude and with forcd fingers rude shatter your leaves before the mellowing year bitter constraint and sad occasion dear compels me to disturb your season due for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime young lycidas and hath not left his peer who would not sing for lycidas he knew himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme he must not float upon his watry bier unwept and welter to the parching wind without the meed of some melodious tear  begin then sisters of the sacred well that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string hence with denial vain and coy excuse so may some gentle muse with lucky words favour my destind urn and as he passes turn and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud  for we were nursd upon the selfsame hill fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill together both ere the high lawns appeard under the opening eyelids of the morn we drove afield and both together heard what time the grayfly winds her sultry horn battning our flocks with the fresh dews of night oft till the star that rose at evning bright toward heavns descent had slopd his westering wheel meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute temperd to thoaten flute rough satyrs dancd and fauns with clovn heel from the glad sound would not be absent long and old damætas lovd to hear our song  but o the heavy change now thou art gone now thou art gone and never must return thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves with wild thyme and the gadding vine oergrown and all their echoes mourn the willows and the hazel copses green shall now no more be seen fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays as killing as the canker to the rose or taintworm to the weanling herds that graze or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear when first the white thorn blows such lycidas thy loss to shepherds ear  where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep closd oer the head of your lovd lycidas for neither were ye playing on the steep where your old bards the famous druids lie nor on the shaggy top of mona high nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream ay me i fondly dream had ye bin therefor what could that have done what could the muse herself that orpheus bore the muse herself for her enchanting son whom universal nature did lament when by the rout that made the hideous roar his gory visage down the stream was sent down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore  alas what boots it with incessant care to tend the homely slighted shepherds trade and strictly meditate the thankless muse were it not better done as others use to sport with amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of neæras hair fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise that last infirmity of noble mind to scorn delights and live laborious days but the fair guerdon when we hope to find and think to burst out into sudden blaze comes the blind fury with thabhorred shears and slits the thinspun life but not the praise phoebus replied and touchd my trembling ears fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil nor in the glistering foil set off to thworld nor in broad rumour lies but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes and perfect witness of alljudging jove as he pronounces lastly on each deed of so much fame in heavn expect thy meed  o fountain arethuse and thou honourd flood smoothsliding mincius crownd with vocal reeds that strain i heard was of a higher mood but now my oat proceeds and listens to the herald of the sea that came in neptunes plea he askd the waves and askd the felon winds what hard mishap hath doomd this gentle swain and questiond every gust of rugged wings that blows from off each beaked promontory they knew not of his story and sage hippotades their answer brings that not a blast was from his dungeon strayd the air was calm and on the level brine sleek panope with all her sisters playd it was that fatal and perfidious bark built in theclipse and riggd with curses dark that sunk so low that sacred head of thine  next camus reverend sire went footing slow his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge inwrought with figures dim and on the edge like to that sanguine flower inscribd with woe ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge last came and last did go the pilot of the galilean lake two massy keys he bore of metals twain the golden opes the iron shuts amain he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake how well could i have spard for thee young swain enow of such as for their bellies sake creep and intrude and climb into the fold of other care they little reckning make than how to scramble at the shearers feast and shove away the worthy bidden guest blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold a sheephook or have learnd aught else the least that to the faithful herdmans art belongs what recks it them what need they they are sped and when they list their lean and flashy songs grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw the hungry sheep look up and are not fed but swolln with wind and the rank mist they draw rot inwardly and foul contagion spread besides what the grim wolf with privy paw daily devours apace and nothing said but that twohanded engine at the door stands ready to smite once and smite no more  return alpheus the dread voice is past that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse and call the vales and bid them hither cast their bells and flowrets of a thousand hues ye valleys low where the mild whispers use of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks throw hither all your quaint enameld eyes that on the green turf suck the honied showers and purple all the ground with vernal flowers bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies the tufted crowtoe and pale jessamine the white pink and the pansy freakd with jet the glowing violet the muskrose and the well attird woodbine with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head and every flower that sad embroidery wears bid amaranthus all his beauty shed and daffadillies fill their cups with tears to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies for so to interpose a little ease let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas wash far away whereer thy bones are hurld whether beyond the stormy hebrides where thou perhaps under the whelming tide visitst the bottom of the monstrous world or whether thou to our moist vows denied sleepst by the fable of bellerus old where the great vision of the guarded mount looks toward namancos and bayonas hold look homeward angel now and melt with ruth and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth  weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watry floor so sinks the daystar in the ocean bed and yet anon repairs his drooping head and tricks his beams and with new spangled ore flames in the forehead of the morning sky so lycidas sunk low but mounted high through the dear might of him that walkd the waves where other groves and other streams along with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves and hears the unexpressive nuptial song in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love there entertain him all the saints above in solemn troops and sweet societies that sing and singing in their glory move and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes now lycidas the shepherds weep no more henceforth thou art the genius of the shore in thy large recompense and shalt be good to all that wander in that perilous flood  thus sang the uncouth swain to thoaks and rills while the still morn went out with sandals gray he touchd the tender stops of various quills with eager thought warbling his doric lay and now the sun had stretchd out all the hills and now was droppd into the western bay at last he rose and twitchd his mantle blue tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new

 mourning doves are not owls after a while away from the city      not because the country appears of a softer feather       less predatory  youre thinking a sound more naturally friendly less edgy and dangerous than the subway but because the  city city to city within itself so sharply details for you   actually walks you through a training in the amplitudes of form  after a while that sharpness wipes the smile the natural had you putting on everything really owls       are so soft       their deadly  accuracy of flight depending on it they are all but silent      a recognizable law nobody says shit you learn       the city  has taught you to  pick up on     which wings bring the disk of their sun for around your neck each day  and which take you out and that your green act of good is natural in that it too depends on the weather

 i  the everlasting universe of things flows through the mind and rolls its rapid waves now darknow glitteringnow reflecting gloom now lending splendour where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings of waterswith a sound but half its own such as a feeble brook will oft assume in the wild woods among the mountains lone where waterfalls around it leap for ever where woods and winds contend and a vast river over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves  ii  thus thou ravine of arvedark deep ravine thou manycolourd manyvoiced vale over whose pines and crags and caverns sail fast cloudshadows and sunbeams awful scene where power in likeness of the arve comes down from the icegulfs that gird his secret throne bursting through these dark mountains like the flame of lightning through the tempestthou dost lie thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging children of elder time in whose devotion the chainless winds still come and ever came to drink their odours and their mighty swinging to hearan old and solemn harmony thine earthly rainbows stretchd across the sweep of the aethereal waterfall whose veil robes some unsculpturd image the strange sleep which when the voices of the desert fail wraps all in its own deep eternity thy caverns echoing to the arves commotion a loud lone sound no other sound can tame thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion thou art the path of that unresting sound dizzy ravine and when i gaze on thee i seem as in a trance sublime and strange to muse on my own separate fantasy my own my human mind which passively now renders and receives fast influencings holding an unremitting interchange with the clear universe of things around one legion of wild thoughts whose wandering wings now float above thy darkness and now rest where that or thou art no unbidden guest in the still cave of the witch poesy seeking among the shadows that pass by ghosts of all things that are some shade of thee some phantom some faint image till the breast from which they fled recalls them thou art there  iii  some say that gleams of a remoter world visit the soul in sleep that death is slumber and that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber of those who wake and livei look on high has some unknown omnipotence unfurld the veil of life and death or do i lie in dream and does the mightier world of sleep spread far around and inaccessibly its circles for the very spirit fails driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep that vanishes among the viewless gales far far above piercing the infinite sky mont blanc appearsstill snowy and serene its subject mountains their unearthly forms pile around it ice and rock broad vales between of frozen floods unfathomable deeps blue as the overhanging heaven that spread and wind among the accumulated steeps a desert peopled by the storms alone save when the eagle brings some hunters bone and the wolf tracks her therehow hideously its shapes are heapd around rude bare and high ghastly and scarrd and rivenis this the scene where the old earthquakedaemon taught her young ruin were these their toys or did a sea of fire envelop once this silent snow none can replyall seems eternal now the wilderness has a mysterious tongue which teaches awful doubt or faith so mild so solemn so serene that man may be but for such faith with nature reconcild thou hast a voice great mountain to repeal large codes of fraud and woe not understood by all but which the wise and great and good interpret or make felt or deeply feel  iv  the fields the lakes the forests and the streams ocean and all the living things that dwell within the daedal earth lightning and rain earthquake and fiery flood and hurricane the torpor of the year when feeble dreams visit the hidden buds or dreamless sleep holds every future leaf and flower the bound with which from that detested trance they leap the works and ways of man their death and birth and that of him and all that his may be all things that move and breathe with toil and sound are born and die revolve subside and swell power dwells apart in its tranquillity remote serene and inaccessible and this the naked countenance of earth on which i gaze even these primeval mountains teach the adverting mind the glaciers creep like snakes that watch their prey from their far fountains slow rolling on there many a precipice frost and the sun in scorn of mortal power have pild dome pyramid and pinnacle a city of death distinct with many a tower and wall impregnable of beaming ice yet not a city but a flood of ruin is there that from the boundaries of the sky rolls its perpetual stream vast pines are strewing its destind path or in the mangled soil branchless and shatterd stand the rocks drawn down from yon remotest waste have overthrown the limits of the dead and living world never to be reclaimd the dwellingplace of insects beasts and birds becomes its spoil their food and their retreat for ever gone so much of life and joy is lost the race of man flies far in dread his work and dwelling vanish like smoke before the tempests stream and their place is not known below vast caves shine in the rushing torrents restless gleam which from those secret chasms in tumult welling meet in the vale and one majestic river the breath and blood of distant lands for ever rolls its loud waters to the oceanwaves breathes its swift vapours to the circling air  v  mont blanc yet gleams on highthe power is there the still and solemn power of many sights and many sounds and much of life and death in the calm darkness of the moonless nights in the lone glare of day the snows descend upon that mountain none beholds them there nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun or the starbeams dart through them winds contend silently there and heap the snow with breath rapid and strong but silently its home the voiceless lightning in these solitudes keeps innocently and like vapour broods over the snow the secret strength of things which governs thought and to the infinite dome of heaven is as a law inhabits thee and what were thou and earth and stars and sea if to the human minds imaginings silence and solitude were vacancy

 the mountain have changed to buildings is this hallway the inside of a stem that has a rattling flower for a head immense tree bark with roots made out of mailboxes in the vertical village moons fly out of apartment windows and though what you see is a modern city the mountain’s guitars pluck inside it’s agriculture taking an elevator through urban caves which lead to paths underground they say camuy to hutuado taino subground like the irt in constant motion  the streets take walks in your dark eyes seashell necklaces make music in the origin of silence what are we stepping on pineapple fields frozen with snow concrete dirt later the rocks of the atlantic the sculpture of the inner earth down there where you thought only worms and unnamed crocodiles parade lefty stands on a corner analyzing every seed squeezing the walls as he passes through at the bottom of the basement where the boiler makes heat the flesh arrives out of a hole in the mountain that goes up like a green wall bodies come in making maraca sounds an invisible map out of the flora bees arrive in the vicinity and sing chorus while woody woodpeckers make women out of trees and place flowers on their heads waterfalls like hurakan’s faucets caress the back of yuquiyu god to all whose tongues have the arawak’s echoes  hallway of graffiti like the master cave drawings made by owls when they had hands you see the fish with pyramids inside their stomachs hanging near the doorways where san lazaro turns the keys villa manhattan breeze of saint juice made from coconuts slide down the stairs to your belly and like a hypnotized guanabana you float down the street and win all your hands at dominoes  the moros live on the top floor eating roots and have a rooster on the roof africans import okra from the bodega the indians make a base of guava on the first floor the building is spinning itself into a spiral of salsa heaven must be calling or the residents know the direction because there is an upward pull if you rise too quickly from your seat you might have to comb a spirit’s hair they float over the chimneys arrive through the smog appear through the plaster of paris it is the same people in the windowed mountains

 on the tip of a hill the silhouette is of something not of this world the body silent in the birth of another shadow swelling still  among stars amp veins the sun dropping below the mountains left hardly any light except what glimmers on the membrane amp slips  into the high grass alone i pulled over to the side of 81 where semis’ blowing horns descend  beyond the sloped field pieces of barbed wire snapped from the line i stepped through the fence its bloodcolored rust rubbed into my hands  for a moment it is something that stays with me like a memory that does not give up easily i try wiping my hands onto my jeans but nothing  it is anything it wants to becalf halflife angelits fur a glaze of cricket sounds amp cool air a thing of stars burnt into hooves a haze  amp i stood there not knowing whether it would be right to touch the one not breathing its nose drying in the grass next to my hands grit  in the creases amp burning now with the dust of splinters like flies my fingers hover over the dead face

 a narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides  you may have met him did you not his notice instant is   the grass divides as with a comb a spotted shaft is seen and then it closes at your feet and opens further on   he likes a boggy acre  a floor too cool for corn  but when a boy and barefoot i more than once at noon  have passed i thought a whip lash unbraiding in the sun when stooping to secure it it wrinkled and was gone   several of nature’s people i know and they know me i feel for them a transport of cordiality  but never met this fellow attended or alone without a tighter breathing and zero at the bone

 1  you may find at the market a casual comment swerves into  conversation that’s deeply metaphysical with a young man by  produce  he wears a white t and jeans ordinary yet careful about his food  “every time i meditate i begin in space among the stars” he says  “many of these beings” he continues “are not physically 3d so it’s frustrating to describe them”  “i have the impression their silver color comes from within”  “they look at me with tremendous love from almondshaped eyes”  “there’s no sunlight the whole cloud structure is luminous and the ground crystalline”  “a lot of purple and blue like twilight”  it’s a complex partly inarticulate narrative perhaps because he feels i won’t believe him yet he’s spontaneous  i don’t need to question the reality of his story  he’s sincere  2  there’s more energy now as heat connectivity radio waves data xrays and all kinds of interactions  we operate with higher electrical current inside which can  rejuvenate you physically by the nature of connectivity moving  freely around the body  the next week smiling midsentence “seeing earth from deep space blue and alive”  more often now ets are discussed at the coop also coincidence spirit molecules time tunnels and quanta uncertainty since we’re close to the institute  i like that he expresses himself to me as a kind of witness in transition  he’s read my work and thinks me more knowledgeable than i am since my poems aren’t true  “pleiadians create new visuals through which i can imagine” he says  my care is required for witness to resonate energetically with listener however nonchalant i appear  the more compassion one has for nonnormal experiences of others the sooner consciousness will shift toward the stars  to him this means shifting the ethical structure of communicating a narrative  “i think of myself in a service capacity”  3  “one silvery insect was seven feet tall i shook his claw and we  conversed”  “sometimes reptiles hoard crystals to send and receive information”  “they can spacetravel versions of themselves here as snakes”  “lipids in a membrane behave like that channeling the atmosphere”  at home i write “the membrane is like a liquid crystal to the sky”  next week in line he’s with a beautiful woman with a worn face who knows me  she’s not well and she wants me to visit them and their animals  “they know they don’t end when they die” she says “it’s sad they’re leaving but it’s voluntary”  “they’ve relatives on other planets sentient beings with the right to vote”  “have you ever watched an animal and suddenly it disappears” he chips in  witness involves a significance equivalent to truth  “the whole idea of visiting another planet communicating with a being from another world to me that’s spiritual”  4  “when they speak they subtly vary certain sounds i hear words but their sound carries different meaning to my body”  “some words i read weren’t there when i began”  “use these new words enhanced by your imagining to allow our  dimension to emerge”  “imagination stabilizes the shift”  in santa fe in tucson lima la paz people see extraterrestrials  when i step outside a velvety multitude of moths and insects  transparencies on my screen door whirls up to the porch light  milky way shines 3d with white clottings and dark rifts covering the ground and trees with phosphorescence  comets asteroids from deep space planets moving at will contribute  to this glamour of wonder  he shows me how to pull frequency starlight down through his body into the ground and i try it i’m more open now  i can carry more light which fuses with similar energies in mass  consciousness  earth will radiate this consciousness as a star or sun on horizons of his other worlds  “let us hold that portal open for you in the form of your little crush on him of light streaming down and feel a surrounding new ideal” they say to me  “now imagine yourself in the pleiades”  “you wish to give a present to the source like compassion or rainwater  from home”  early on i divined that this book already exists in the future  after all i’d thought of it it’s a probability somewhere complete on a shelf  my intention is to seek that future edition and consult it to create this one the original for you

 1  we travel upon the ark in mud and rain our oars promises from god we liveand the rest of humanity dies we travel upon the waves fastening our lives to the ropes of corpses filling the skies but between heaven and us is an opening a porthole for a supplication  why lord have you saved us alone from among all the people and creatures and where are you casting us now to your other land to our first home into the leaves of death into the wind of life in us in our arteries flows a fear of the sun we despair of the light we despair lord of a tomorrow in which to start life anew  if only we were not that seedling of creation of earth and its generations if only we had remained simple clay or ember or something in between then we would not have to see this world its lord and its hell twice over  2  if time started anew and waters submerged the face of life and the earth convulsed and that god rushed to me beseeching noah save the living i would not concern myself with his request i would travel upon my ark removing clay and pebbles from the eyes of the dead i would open the depths of their being to the flood and whisper in their veins that we have returned from the wilderness that we have emerged from the cave that we have changed the sky of years that we sail without giving in to our fears that we do not heed the word of that god our appointment is with death our shores are a familiar and pleasing despair a gelid sea of iron water that we ford to its very ends undeterred heedless of that god and his word longing for a different a new lord

 “painting a wave requires no system” the painter said painting a wave “systems may get you flotsam and jetsam seaweed and so forth but never a wave”  there was a scroll or finelined curve on the canvas first and then what looked like hair flying or grayish nerves which began to move as the painter worked  “painting the sea is a lot of trouble it never stops still for a moment so i try to make it internal mental as though i stopped it then let it go”  something began to pulse and tumble out of the brushes the ink the chalk a long black line commenced to tremble then like a fishline started to jerk     with what at the end “i think i’ve caught it” a drop of water hung by a hair “if i could only stop it a minute” the drop began to race somewhere  spreading out in every direction a bird of thread caught in a storm trying to say “connection action” but in the end it was very calm  soon there was water under water and over the sand a sun    a moon who could have seen that wave of water one night ago or a thousand and one  who could have seen the lid of water with its thin mascara of buoys and corks with its lined horizon’s distant glimmer of maybe a skyline like new york’s  now there will be that morning evening tide dyeing the water’s pulse the wave drying in inkthe wave moving momentous motionless

 because anyone sitting still attracts desire even this will not be given you the park in june the silence of a bench at eleven o’clock  on a monday morning or four on a thursday afternoon someone will drift toward you unattached and lonely the spell will be broken the wrong word said  it is cool but there is no death in the few token leaves that must have come down last night in the rain that freshened the treesmell that remains for this season there is no name  not summer and none of the months of the year a something inside you search your mind for the green arboriferous word the boys and girls swing out of  like a tree and the lovers on the grass in tantric mode in an ecstasy of untouching and the human buddhas legs infolded reading  branches sheer translucent leaves you would die to get under them forever if it were given you the park on this a day like any other day  and not the knowledge of everyone ever met who will come upon you sooner or later if only you stay here no not people or the walkways  made in another century or the murmur of the great city everywhere in the distance but this breathingspace where the void no longer terrible  but to be relaxed in the depressions which anyway here are mild incoming from the west slowacting chronic lifelong not acute  are there to be sat through waited out on a damp bench as a man sweeps up around you and the sun comes out in real time stealing over the ground

 we have had our lives the reservoir visible in the window beside our elbows and the willow branches trailing at our stop are the nature we leave behind us gladly since it has no place  for all we have recently learned that sex is temporary help ours to hand down now and materials science not the only kind we thank calm careful minerva goddess of adults who for so many years took us  to school her voice the timbre of fretless bass her eyes the color of pencil lead she taught us how to behave in order to have our rewards in twenty years we have them and if we wish too often this fall to have led another life we do not mean that we would give up ours  though we stand in a row and sway before an obstructed view we are able to find initials outlined in the crosshatched trees and pebblescalculiaround our ponds and cherish them we like to watch the roads along which the perennial pollen sifts down  as finely as ever making a soft powder of brass amid the troughs in softball fields our skills are finally in demand if you mock us pan in whom we also believe do it as gently as you can

 once when i was harmless and didn’t know any better  a mirror to the front of me and an ocean behind  i lay wedged in the middle of daylight paperdoll thin dreaming  then i vanished i gave the day a fingerprint then forgot  i sat naked on a towel on a hot june monday  the sun etched the inside of my eyelids while a boy dozed at my side  the smell of all oceans was around us steamy salt shell and sweat  but i reached for the distant one a tide rose while i slept  and soon i was alone try being a figure in memory it’s hollow there  for truth’s sake i’ll say she was on a beach and her eyes were closed  she was bare in the sand long and the hour took her bit by bit

 see with what simplicity this nymph begins her golden days in the green grass she loves to lie and there with her fair aspect tames the wilder flowers and gives them names but only with the roses plays and them does tell what colour best becomes them and what smell  who can foretell for what high cause this darling of the gods was born yet this is she whose chaster laws the wanton love shall one day fear and under her command severe see his bow broke and ensigns torn happy who can appease this virtuous enemy of man  o then let me in time compound and parley with those conquering eyes ere they have tried their force to wound ere with their glancing wheels they drive in triumph over hearts that strive and them that yield but more despise let me be laid where i may see thy glories from some shade  meantime whilst every verdant thing itself does at thy beauty charm reform the errors of the spring make that the tulips may have share of sweetness seeing they are fair and roses of their thorns disarm but most procure that violets may a longer age endure  but o young beauty of the woods whom nature courts with fruits and flowers gather the flowers but spare the buds lest flora angry at thy crime to kill her infants in their prime do quickly make the example yours and ere we see nip in the blossom all our hopes and thee

 at this hour the soul floats weightlessly through the city streets speechless and invisible astonished by the smoky blend of grays and golds seeping out of the air the dark halftones  of dusk suddenly filling the urban sky while the body sits listlessly by the window sullen and heavy too exhausted to move too weary to stand up or to lie down  at this hour the soul is like a yellow wing slipping through the treetops a little ecstatic cloud hovering over the sidewalks calling out to the approaching night “amaze me amaze me”  while the body sits glumly by the window listening to the clear summons of the dead transparent as glass clairvoyant as crystal some nights it is almost ready to join them  oh this is a strange unlikely tethering a furious grafting of the quick and the slow when the soul flies up the body sinks down and all nightlocked in the same cramped room  they go on quarreling stubbornly threatening to leave each other wordlessly filling the air with the sound of a low internal burning how long can this bewildering marriage last  at midnight the soul dreams of a small fire of stars flaming on the other side of the sky but the body stares into an empty night sheen a holloweyed darkness poor luckless angels  feverish old loves don’t separate yet let what rises live with what descends

 for warren winslow dead at sea  let man have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and the beasts of the whole earth and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth i   a brackish reach of shoal off madaket the sea was still breaking violently and night had steamed into our north atlantic fleet when the drowned sailor clutched the dragnet light flashed from his matted head and marble feet he grappled at the net with the coiled hurdling muscles of his thighs the corpse was bloodless a botch of reds and whites its open staring eyes were lustreless deadlights or cabinwindows on a stranded hulk heavy with sand we weight the body close its eyes and heave it seaward whence it came where the heelheaded dogfish barks its nose on ahab’s void and forehead and the name is blocked in yellow chalk sailors who pitch this portent at the sea where dreadnaughts shall confess its hellbent deity when you are powerless to sandbag this atlantic bulwark faced by the earthshaker green unwearied chaste in his steel scales ask for no orphean lute to pluck life back the guns of the steeled fleet recoil and then repeat the hoarse salute   ii   whenever winds are moving and their breath heaves at the ropedin bulwarks of this pier the terns and seagulls tremble at your death in these home waters sailor can you hear the pequod’s sea wings beating landward fall headlong and break on our atlantic wall off ’sconset where the yawing sboats splash the bellbuoy with ballooning spinnakers as the entangled screeching mainsheet clears the blocks off madaket where lubbers lash the heavy surf and throw their long lead squids for bluefish seagulls blink their heavy lids seaward the winds’ wings beat upon the stones cousin and scream for you and the claws rush at the sea’s throat and wring it in the slush of this old quaker graveyard where the bones cry out in the long night for the hurt beast bobbing by ahab’s whaleboats in the east   iii   all you recovered from poseidon died with you my cousin and the harrowed brine is fruitless on the blue beard of the god stretching beyond us to the castles in spain nantucket’s westward haven to cape cod guns cradled on the tide blast the eelgrass about a waterclock of bilge and backwash roil the salt and sand lashing earth’s scaffold rock our warships in the hand of the great god where time’s contrition blues whatever it was these quaker sailors lost in the mad scramble of their lives they died when time was openeyed wooden and childish only bones abide there in the nowhere where their boats were tossed skyhigh where mariners had fabled news of is the whited monster what it cost them is their secret in the spermwhale’s slick i see the quakers drown and hear their cry “if god himself had not been on our side if god himself had not been on our side when the atlantic rose against us why then it had swallowed us up quick”   iv   this is the end of the whaleroad and the whale who spewed nantucket bones on the thrashed swell and stirred the troubled waters to whirlpools to send the pequod packing off to hell this is the end of them threequarters fools snatching at straws to sail seaward and seaward on the turntail whale spouting out blood and water as it rolls sick as a dog to these atlantic shoals clamavimus o depths let the seagulls wail  for water for the deep where the high tide mutters to its hurt self mutters and ebbs waves wallow in their wash go out and out leave only the deathrattle of the crabs the beach increasing its enormous snout sucking the ocean’s side this is the end of running on the waves we are poured out like water who will dance the mastlashed master of leviathans up from this field of quakers in their unstoned graves   v   when the whale’s viscera go and the roll of its corruption overruns this world beyond treeswept nantucket and woods hole and martha’s vineyard sailor will your sword whistle and fall and sink into the fat in the great ashpit of jehoshaphat the bones cry for the blood of the white whale the fat flukes arch and whack about its ears the deathlance churns into the sanctuary tears the gunblue swingle heaving like a flail and hacks the coiling life out it works and drags and rips the spermwhale’s midriff into rags gobbets of blubber spill to wind and weather sailor and gulls go round the stoven timbers where the morning stars sing out together and thunder shakes the white surf and dismembers the red flag hammered in the masthead hide our steel jonas messias in thy side   vi   our lady of walsingham   there once the penitents took off their shoes and then walked barefoot the remaining mile and the small trees a stream and hedgerows file slowly along the munching english lane like cows to the old shrine until you lose track of your dragging pain the stream flows down under the druid tree shiloah’s whirlpools gurgle and make glad the castle of god sailor you were glad and whistled sion by that stream but see  our lady too small for her canopy sits near the altar there’s no comeliness at all or charm in that expressionless face with its heavy eyelids as before this face for centuries a memory non est species neque decor expressionless expresses god it goes past castled sion she knows what god knows not calvary’s cross nor crib at bethlehem now and the world shall come to walsingham   vii   the empty winds are creaking and the oak splatters and splatters on the cenotaph the boughs are trembling and a gaff bobs on the untimely stroke of the greased wash exploding on a shoalbell in the old mouth of the atlantic it’s well atlantic you are fouled with the blue sailors seamonsters upward angel downward fish unmarried and corroding spare of flesh mart once of supercilious wing’d clippers atlantic where your belltrap guts its spoil you could cut the brackish winds with a knife here in nantucket and cast up the time when the lord god formed man from the sea’s slime and breathed into his

 the rain in the backyard where i watch it fall comes down at different  rates in the center a fine discontinuous curtain  or network  falls implacably and yet gently in drops that are probably quite light a strengthless sempiternal precipitation an intense fraction of the atmosphere at its purest a little distance from the walls to the right and left plunk heavier drops one by one here they seem about the size of grains of wheat the size of a pea while elsewhere they are big as marbles along gutters and window frames the rain runs horizontally while depending from the same obstacles it hangs like individually wrapped candies along the entire surface of a little zinc roof under my eyes it trickles in a very thin sheet a moiré pattern formed by the varying currents created by the imperceptible bumps and undulations of the surface from the gutter it flows with the restraint of a shallow creek until it tumbles out into a perfectly vertical net rather imperfectly braided all the way to the ground where it breaks and sparkles into brilliant needles  each of its forms has its particular allure and corresponds to a particular patter together they share the intensity of a complex mechanism  as precise as it is dangerous like a steampowered clock whose spring is wound by the force of the precipitation  the ringing on the ground of the vertical trickles the glugglug of the gutters the miniscule strikes of the gong multiply and resonate all at once in a concert without monotony and not without a certain delicacy  once the spring unwinds itself certain wheels go on turning for a while more and more slowly until the whole mechanism comes to a stop it all vanishes with the sun when it finally reappears the brilliant apparatus evaporates it has rained translated from the french

 yes well gather by the river the beautiful the beautiful river they say it runs by the throne of god this is where god invented fish wherever but then gods throne is as wide as the universe if youre attentive youll see the thrones borders in the stars were on this side and when you get to the other side we dont know what will happen if anything if nothing happens we wont know it i said once is that cynical no nothing is nothing not upsetting just nothing then again maybe well be cast at the speed of light through the universe to gods throne his hair is bounteous all the 5000 birds on earth were created there the firstborn cranes herons hawks at the back so as not to frighten the little ones even now they remember this divine habitat shall we gather at the river this beautiful river well sing with the warblers perched on his eyelashes

 the view   the plain’s hatching now after rainless months  a dust devil rips through a peach orchard  down there a seam snuffed by falling dustfruit  behind the vine rows’ shriveled abundance  a low fire runs ragged by the ditch  flaying the pale sod the voided skins wave  september thirsting sings our hosannah  shrieks red poverties to old heaven’s eye      1944   you want february snow and sleet came down hard heaven’s postchristmas gift to freeze our eyelids shut walking the icy ground our shoes all shot with holes we did the alexander’s army ragtime dance stomping snow off bones safely packed in newspapers from down below we must have looked crazy happy dancing like hollywood indians though who had anything to eat we dreamed lard so the wolves came not straight into town not into the piazza but near the outcrop behind the church god’s design the best the way they study the tired world makes them next to human or more they’re waiting while they move i’d worship that expectancy if i could talk to one just a few minutes he’d teach me hunger’s secrets so one awful night i wrapped my legs and feet stuffed more papers inside my pants and shirt then danced my way behind the church faint gray writing on the snow skin and bones sneezes frost feathers drifting away two of them walked back canny bigshot archbishop warrior types they said the moon’s blue we know you want secrets help advice news from this side our truth is forget likenesses live inside your carbon soul the moon’s black and blue in the soul’s time the world’s one winter together      renunciation   the snowy poplar seeds are everywhere balling against curbs and car wheels  sifting through gates doorways kitchen windows snagged by white blossoms shaken loose  from the nodding horsechestnut leaves we stand in their shadowsour springtime’s dark  the debris scrapes our cheeks clings an instant to our lashes chokes the soft breath  before tumbling off the near precipice we want divine uncertainty  o give us the judas tree’s blood shadows make us sick with rank pear blossoms  blind us with earth’s random pieces engorged with broom’s milky fallensun flesh

 give me a church made entirely of salt let the walls hiss and smoke when i return to shore  i ask for the grace of a new freckle on my cheek the lift of blue and my mother’s soapy skin to greet me  hide me in a room with no windows never let me see the dolphins leaping into commas  for this waterprayer rising like a host of sky lanterns into the inky evening let them hang  in the sky until they vanish at the edge of the constellations  the heroes and animals too busy and bright to notice

 we gave our dogs a button to sniff or a tissue and they bounded off confident in their training in the power of their senses to recreate the body  but after eighteen hours in rubble where even steel was pulverized they curled on themselves and stared up at us and in their soft huge eyes we saw mirrored the longing for death  then we had to beg a stranger to be a victim and crouch behind a girder and let the dogs discover him and tug him proudly with suppressed yaps back to command and the rows of empty triage tables  but who will hide from us who will keep digging for us here in the cloud of ashes

 then all the nations of birds lifted together the huge net of the shadows of this earth in multitudinous dialects twittering tongues stitching and crossing it they lifted up the shadows of long pines down trackless slopes the shadows of glassfaced towers down evening streets the shadow of a frail plant on a city sill the net rising soundless as night the birds cries soundless until there was no longer dusk or season decline or weather only this passage of phantasmal light that not the narrowest shadow dared to sever  and men could not see looking up what the wild geese drew what the ospreys trailed behind them in silvery ropes that flashed in the icy sunlight they could not hear battalions of starlings waging peaceful cries bearing the net higher covering this world like the vines of an orchard or a mother drawing the trembling gauze over the trembling eyes of a child fluttering to sleep it was the light that you will see at evening on the side of a hill in yellow october and no one hearing knew what change had brought into the ravens cawing the killdeers screech the embercircling chough such an immense soundless and high concern for the fields and cities where the birds belong except it was their seasonal passing love made seasonless or from the high privilege of their birth something brighter than pity for the wingless ones below them who shared dark holes in windows and in houses and higher they lifted the net with soundless voices above all change betrayals of falling suns and this season lasted one moment like the pause between dusk and darkness between fury and peace but for such as our earth is now it lasted long  
NEW POEM
 as rising from the vegetable world my theme ascends with equal wing ascend my panting muse and hark how loud the woods invite you forth in all your gayest trim lend me your song ye nightingales oh pour the mazyrunning soul of melody into my varied verse while i deduce from the first note the hollow cuckoo sings the symphony of spring and touch a theme unknown to fame the passion of the groves   when first the soul of love is sent abroad warm thro the vital air and on the heart harmonious seizes the gay troops begin in gallant thought to plume the painted wing and try again the longforgotten strain at first faintwarbled but no sooner grows the soft infusion prevalent and wide than all alive at once their joy o’erflows in musick unconfin’d upsprings the lark shrillvoic’d and loud the messenger of morn ere yet the shadows fly he mounted sings amid the dawning clouds and from their haunts calls up the tuneful nations every copse deeptangled tree irregular and bush bending with dewy moisture o’er the heads of the coy quiristers that lodge within are prodigal of harmony the thrush and woodlark o’er the kind contending throng superior heard run thro’ the sweetest length of notes when listening philomela deigns to let them joy and purposes in thought elate to make her night excel their day the blackbird whistles from the thorny brake the mellow bullfinch answers from the grove nor are the linnets o’er the flow’ring furze pour’d out profusely silent join’d to these innumerous songsters in the freshening shade of newsprung leaves their modulations mix mellifluous the jay the rook the daw and each harsh pipe discordant heard alone aid the full concert while the stockdove breathes a melancholy murmur thro’ the whole  ’tis love creates their melody and all this waste of music is the voice of love that even to birds and beasts the tender arts of pleasing teaches hence the glossy kind try every winning way inventive love can dictate and in courtship to their mates pour forth their little souls first wide around with distant awe in airy rings they rove endeavouring by a thousand tricks to catch the cunning conscious halfaverted glance of their regardless charmer should she seem softening the least approvance to bestow their colours burnish and by hope inspir’d they brisk advance then on a sudden struck retire disorder’d then again approach in fond rotation spread the spotted wing and shiver every feather with desire  connubial leagues agreed to the deep woods they haste away all as their fancy leads pleasure or food or secret safety prompts that nature’s great command may be obey’d nor all the sweet sensations they perceive indulg’d in vain some to the hollyhedge nestling repair and to the thicket some some to the rude protection of the thorn commit their feeble offspring the cleft tree offers its kind concealment to a few their food its insects and its moss their nests others apart far in the grassy dale or roughening waste their humble texture weave but most in woodland solitudes delight in unfrequented glooms or shaggy banks steep and divided by a babbling brook whose murmurs soothe them all the livelong day when by kind duty fix’d among the roots of hazel pendant o’er the plaintive stream they frame the first foundation of their domes dry sprigs of trees in artful fabrick laid and bound with clay together now ’tis nought but restless hurry thro the busy air beat by unnumer’d wings the swallow sweeps the slimy pool to build his hanging house intent and often from the careless back of herds and flocks a thousand tugging bills pluck hair and wool and oft when unobserv’d steal from the barn a straw till soft and warm clean and compleat their habitation grows  as thus the patient dam assiduous sits not to be tempted from her tender task or by sharp hunger or by smooth delight tho the whole loosen’d spring around her blows her sympathizing lover takes his stand high on th’ opponent bank and ceaseless sings the tedious time away or else supplies her place a moment while she sudden flits to pick the scanty meal th’ appointed time with pious toil fulfill’d the callow young warm’d and expanded into perfect life their brittle bondage break and come to light a helpless family demanding food with constant clamour o what passions then what melting sentiments of kindly care on the new parents seize away they fly affectionate and undesiring bear the most delicious morsel to their young which equally distributed again the search begins even so a gentle pair by fortune sunk but form’d of generous mold and charm’d with cares beyond the vulgar breast in some lone cott amid the distant woods sustain’d alone by providential heaven  oft as they weeping eye their infant train check their own appetites and give them all  nor toil alone they scorn exalting love by the great father of the spring inspir’d gives instant courage to the fearful race and to the simple art with stealthy wing should some rude foot their woody haunts molest amid a neighbouring bush they silent drop and whirring thence as if alarm’d deceive th’ unfeeling schoolboy hence around the head of wandering swain the whitewing’d plover wheels her sounding flight and then directly on in long excursion skims the level lawn to tempt him from her nest the wildduck hence o’er the rough moss and o’er the trackless waste the heathhen flutters pious fraud to lead the hot pursuing spaniel far astray  be not the muse asham’d here to bemoan her brothers of the grove by tyrant man inhuman caught and in the narrow cage from liberty confin’d and boundless air dull are the pretty slaves their plumage dull ragged and all its brightening lustre lost nor is that sprightly wildness in their notes which clear and vigorous warbles from the beech oh then ye friends of love and lovetaught song spare the soft tribes this barbarous art forbear if on your bosom innocence can win music engage or piety persuade  but let not chief the nightingale lament her ruin’d care too delicately fram’d to brook the harsh confinement of the cage oft when returning with her loaded bill th’ astonish’d mother finds a vacant nest by the hard hand of unrelenting clowns robb’d to the ground the vain provision falls her pinions ruffle and lowdrooping scarce can bear the mourner to the poplar shade where all abandon’d to despair she sings her sorrows thro the night and on the bough solesitting still at every dying fall takes up again her lamentable strain of winding woe till wide around the woods sigh to her song and with her wail resound  but now the feather’d youth their former bounds ardent disdain and weighing oft their wings demand the free possession of the sky this one glad office more and then dissolves parental love at once now needless grown unlavish wisdom never works in vain ’tis on some evening sunny grateful mild when nought but balm is breathing thro the woods with yellow lustre bright that the new tribes visit the spacious heavens and look abroad on nature’s common far as they can see or wing their range and pasture o’er the boughs dancing about still at the giddy verge their resolution fails their pinions till in loose libration stretch’d to trust the void trembling refuse till down before them fly the parentguides and chide exhort command or push them off the surging air receives the plumy burden and their selftaught wings winnow the waving element on ground alighted bolder up again they lead farther and farther on the lengthening flight till vanish’d every fear and every power rouz’d into life and action light in air th’ acquitted parents see their soaring race and once rejoicing never know them more

 i see myself in the shadows of a leaf compressed to the green blades growing to a point like the shards of miles of mirrors falling and cracking to perfect gardens  i never inspect the withered assumption of my face’s petty dialogue in raindrops the deceptive spreading of the words oozing from the skin to the edges of water etched on the ground by gravity and wishing  passing for the seriousness of my eye platitudes of my white collar or the perfect posture of my lips it skirts from the leaves of the plant hiding me and sits stoic like stone in my pupil mute and unassuming like rashi  to gather myself i will swim naked in the wind bending my blind elbows in circles stopping now to dance like the cherubic gold on the ark and gather myself from the particles of this excitement another structure one closely resembling the beginning

 send forth the high falcon flying after the mind till it come toppling down from its cold cloud the beak of the falcon to pierce it till it fall where the simple heart is bowed o in wild innocence it rides the rare ungovernable element but once it sways to terror and descent the marches of the wind are its abyss no wind staying it upward of the breast let mind be proud for this and ignorant from what fabulous cause it dropt or with how learned a gesture the unschooled heart shall lull both terror and innocence to rest

 exploring the farm as a child i would part the tall grasses moving through the dirt beneath the thick rushes consisting mainly of overgrown clover and clusters of foliage i’d map the distance that made up our property it seemed endless that innocent drive to run further beneath the ceiling of leaves expanses of earth shifting beneath a child’s slight weight i would imagine how far the landscape stretched  one afternoon when my parents were at the races i followed the pasture floor to the fenceline at the back of the property wanting to go further i hovered a blade of grass over the ticking wire as i had watched dad do so many times to test if it was safe to cross feeling nothing i wrapped my hands around one of the copper threads  struck by that first surge through the body electricity running like a vein of blood beneath the skin as though a voice screamed through a haze blinding my eyes and rattling my mind with panic  no longer wishing to know more to understand i stood startled at the trapped earth and wires that had run a painful electric current through my body it would have been foolish to even attempt climbing over into the neighboring paddock all i could do then was give up

 four feet up under the bruiseblue fingered hatfelt the eyes begin the sly brim slips over the sky street after street and nobody knows to stop it it will cover the whole world if there is time fifty years’ start in gray the eyes have you will never catch up to where they are too clever and always walking the legs not long but the boots big with wide smiles of darkness going round and round at their tops climbing they are almost to the knees already where there should have been ankles to stop them so must keep walking all the time hurry for the black sea is down where the toes are and swallows and swallows all a big coat can help save you but eyes push you down never meet eyes there are hands in hands and love follows its furs into shut doors who shall be killed first do not look up there the wind is blowing the buildingtops and a hand is sneaking the whole sky another way but it will not escape do not look up god is on high he can see you you will die

 the thunderstorm came like a pot boiling over and the color of water was made by that all of a sudden a pigment more tropical than dense with the reflection of light everywhere the scent of at least five different kinds of plants lifted up the desert can’t talk back but i believe it breathes instead breathes vivid when the water wants it the water can’t wait and it breathes back i turned and went into the house under the dining room table a snake green with a yellow stripe bisecting its back motion ate each centimeter of floor and air scared it makes sense to say though there exists or existed no safer time ever in which that shape wouldn’t want to move dead august being the exception to this when heat makes molasses of all of us why did i want to chase it out i did i got a rake and kept making it make that beautiful scared shape upon the floor so clean like two ice cubes rubbing each other and too cold to melt nothing organized that fear seeing the edges it found its way out

 ghost sun half hidden where did you go  there’s always a mother of some other creature born to fight for her young  but crawl out of your hide walk upright like a man amp you may ask if hunger is the only passion as you again lose yourself in a white field’s point of view  in this glacial quiet nothing moves except then a flash of eyes amp nerves  if cornered in your head by cries from a cave in another season you can’t forget in this landscape a pretty horse translates into a man holding a gun

 1 the saturday morning meadowlark came in from high up with her song gliding into tall grass still singing how id like to glide around singing in the summer then to go south to where i already was and find fields full of meadowlarks in winter but when walking my dog i want four legs to keep up with her as she thunders down the hill at top speed then belly flops into the deep pond lark or dog i crave the impossible im just human all too human   2 i was nineteen and mentally infirm when i saw the prophet isaiah the hem of his robe was as wide as the horizon and his trunk and face were thousands of feet up in the air maybe he appeared because i had read him so much and opened too many ancient doors i was cooking my life in a cracked clay pot that was leaking i had found secrets i didnt deserve to know when the battle for the mind is finally over its late june green and raining  3 a violent windstorm the night before the solstice the house creaked and yawned i thought the morning might bring a bald earth bald as a mans bald head but not shiny but dawn was fine with a few downed trees the yellow rosebush splendidly intact the grass was all there dotted with black angus cattle the grass is indestructible except to fire but now its too green to burn what did the cattle do in this storm they stood with their butts toward the wind erect buddhists waiting for nothing in particular i was in bed cringing at gusts imagining the contents of earth all blowing north and piled up where the wind stopped the pile skyhigh no one can climb it a gopher comes out of a hole as if nothing happened  4 the sun should be a couple of million miles closer today it wouldnt hurt anything and anyway this cold rainy june is hard on me and the nesting birds my own nest is stupidly uncomfortable the chair of many years the old windows dont keep the weather out the wet wind whipping my hair a very old robin drops dead on the lawn a first for me millions of birds die but we never see itthey like privacy in this holy fatal moment or so i think we cant tell each other when we die others must carry the message to and fro hes gone theyll say while writing an average poem destined to disappear among the millions of poems written now by mortally average poets  5 solstice at the cabin deep in the forest the full moon shines in the river there are pale green northern lights a huge thunderstorm comes slowly from the west lightning strikes a nearby tamarack bursting into flame i go into the cabin feeling unworthy at dawn the tree is still smoldering in this place the gods touched earth

 for detroit there are birds here so many birds here is what i was trying to say when they said those birds were metaphors for what is trapped between buildings and buildings no the birds are here to root around for bread the girl’s hands tear and toss like confetti no i don’t mean the bread is torn like cotton i said confetti and no not the confetti a tank can make of a building i mean the confetti a boy can’t stop smiling about and no his smile isn’t much like a skeleton at all and no his neighborhood is not like a war zone i am trying to say his neighborhood is as tattered and feathered as anything else as shadow pierced by sun and light parted by shadowdance as anything else but they won’t stop saying how lovely the ruins how ruined the lovely children must be in that birdless city

 when you put on the mask the thunder starts through the nostril’s orange you can smell the far hope of rain up in the nilgiris glisten of eucalyptus drip of pine spiders tumbling from their silver webs  the mask is raw and red as bark against your facebones  you finger the stripes ridged like weals out of your childhood a wind is rising in the north a scarlet light like a fire in the sky  when you look through the eyeholes it is like falling  night gauzes you in black you are blind as in the beginning of the world sniff seek the moon after a while you will know that creased musky smell is rising from your skin  once you locate the ears the drums begin  your fur stiffens a roar from the distant left like monsoon water you swivel your sightless head under your sheathed paw the ground shifts wet  what is that small wild sound  sheltering in your skull against the circle that always closes in just before dawn     note  the poem refers to a ritual performed by some rajasthani hill tribes to ensure rain and a good harvest

 before our lives divide for ever while time is with us and hands are free time swift to fasten and swift to sever hand from hand as we stand by the sea i will say no word that a man might say whose whole lifes love goes down in a day for this could never have been and never though the gods and the years relent shall be  is it worth a tear is it worth an hour to think of things that are well outworn of fruitless husk and fugitive flower the dream foregone and the deed forborne though joy be done with and grief be vain time shall not sever us wholly in twain earth is not spoilt for a single shower but the rain has ruined the ungrown corn  it will grow not again this fruit of my heart smitten with sunbeams ruined with rain the singing seasons divide and depart winter and summer depart in twain it will grow not again it is ruined at root the bloodlike blossom the dull red fruit though the heart yet sickens the lips yet smart with sullen savour of poisonous pain  i have given no man of my fruit to eat i trod the grapes i have drunken the wine had you eaten and drunken and found it sweet this wild new growth of the corn and vine this wine and bread without lees or leaven we had grown as gods as the gods in heaven souls fair to look upon goodly to greet one splendid spirit your soul and mine  in the change of years in the coil of things in the clamour and rumour of life to be we drinking love at the furthest springs covered with love as a covering tree we had grown as gods as the gods above filled from the heart to the lips with love held fast in his hands clothed warm with his wings o love my love had you loved but me  we had stood as the sure stars stand and moved as the moon moves loving the world and seen grief collapse as a thing disproved death consume as a thing unclean twain halves of a perfect heart made fast soul to soul while the years fell past had you loved me once as you have not loved had the chance been with us that has not been  i have put my days and dreams out of mind days that are over dreams that are done though we seek life through we shall surely find there is none of them clear to us now not one but clear are these things the grass and the sand where sure as the eyes reach ever at hand with lips wide open and face burnt blind the strong seadaisies feast on the sun  the low downs lean to the sea the stream one loose thin pulseless tremulous vein rapid and vivid and dumb as a dream works downward sick of the sun and the rain no wind is rough with the rank rare flowers the sweet sea mother of loves and hours shudders and shines as the grey winds gleam turning her smile to a fugitive pain  mother of loves that are swift to fade mother of mutable winds and hours a barren mother a mothermaid cold and clean as her faint salt flowers i would we twain were even as she lost in the night and the light of the sea where faint sounds falter and wan beams wade break and are broken and shed into showers  the loves and hours of the life of a man they are swift and sad being born of the sea hours that rejoice and regret for a span born with a mans breath mortal as he loves that are lost ere they come to birth weeds of the wave without fruit upon earth i lose what i long for save what i can my love my love and no love for me  it is not much that a man can save on the sands of life in the straits of time who swims in sight of the great third wave that never a swimmer shall cross or climb some waif washed up with the strays and spars that ebbtide shows to the shore and the stars weed from the water grass from a grave a broken blossom a ruined rhyme  there will no man do for your sake i think what i would have done for the least word said i had wrung life dry for your lips to drink broken it up for your daily bread body for body and blood for blood as the flow of the full sea risen to flood that yearns and trembles before it sink i had given and lain down for you glad and dead  yea hope at highest and all her fruit and time at fullest and all his dower i had given you surely and life to boot were we once made one for a single hour but now you are twain you are cloven apart flesh of his flesh but heart of my heart and deep in one is the bitter root and sweet for one is the lifelong flower  to have died if you cared i should die for you clung to my life if you bade me played my part as it pleased you  these were the thoughts that stung the dreams that smote with a keener dart than shafts of love or arrows of death these were but as fire is dust or breath or poisonous foam on the tender tongue of the little snakes that eat my heart  i wish we were dead together today lost sight of hidden away out of sight clasped and clothed in the cloven clay out of the worlds way out of the light out of the ages of worldly weather forgotten of all men altogether as the worlds first dead taken wholly away made one with death filled full of the night  how we should slumber how we should sleep far in the dark with the dreams and the dews and dreaming grow to each other and weep laugh low live softly murmur and muse yea and it may be struck through by the dream feel the dust quicken and quiver and seem alive as of old to the lips and leap spirit to spirit as lovers use  sick dreams and sad of a dull delight for what shall it profit when men are dead to have dreamed to have loved with the whole souls might to have looked for day when the day was fled let come what will there is one thing worth to have had fair love in the life upon earth to have held love safe till the day grew night while skies had colour and lips were red  would i lose you now would i take you then if i lose you now that my heart has need and come what may after death to men what thing worth this will the dead years breed lose life lose all but at least i know o sweet lifes love having loved you so had i reached you on earth i should lose not again in death nor life nor in dream or deed  yea i know this well were you once sealed mine mine in the bloods beat mine in the breath mixed into me as honey in wine not time that sayeth and gainsayeth nor all strong things had severed us then not wrath of gods nor wisdom of men nor all things earthly nor all divine nor joy nor sorrow nor life nor death  i had grown pure as the dawn and the dew you had grown strong as the sun or the sea but none shall triumph a whole life through for death is one and the fates are three at the door of life by the gate of breath there are worse things waiting for men than death death could not sever my soul and you as these have severed your soul from me  you have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer but will it not one day in heaven repent you will they solace you wholly the days that were will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss meet mine and see where the great love is and tremble and turn and be changed content you the gate is strait i shall not be there  but you had you chosen had you stretched hand had you seen good such a thing were done i too might have stood with the souls that stand in the suns sight clothed with the light of the sun but who now on earth need care how i live have the high gods anything left to give save dust and laurels and gold and sand which gifts are goodly but i will none  o all fair lovers about the world there is none of you none that shall comfort me my thoughts are as dead things wrecked and whirled round and round in a gulf of the sea and still through the sound and the straining stream through the coil and chafe they gleam in a dream the bright fine lips so cruelly curled and strange swift eyes where the soul sits free  free without pity withheld from woe ignorant fair as the eyes are fair would i have you change now change at a blow startled and stricken awake and aware yea if i could would i have you see my very love of you filling me and know my soul to the quick as i know the likeness and look of your throat and hair  i shall not change you nay though i might would i change my sweet one love with a word i had rather your hair should change in a night clear now as the plume of a black bright bird your face fail suddenly cease turn grey die as a leaf that dies in a day i will keep my soul in a place out of sight far off where the pulse of it is not heard  far off it walks in a bleak blown space full of the sound of the sorrow of years i have woven a veil for the weeping face whose lips have drunken the wine of tears i have found a way for the failing feet a place for slumber and sorrow to meet there is no rumour about the place nor light nor any that sees or hears  i have hidden my soul out of sight and said let none take pity upon thee none comfort thy crying for lo thou art dead lie still now safe out of sight of the sun have i not built thee a grave and wrought thy graveclothes on thee of grievous thought with soft spun verses and tears unshed and sweet light visions of things undone  i have given thee garments and balm and myrrh and gold and beautiful burial things but thou be at peace now make no stir is not thy grave as a royal kings fret not thyself though the end were sore sleep be patient vex me no more sleep what hast thou to do with her the eyes that weep with the mouth that sings  where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten the cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by the misconceived and the misbegotten i would find a sin to do ere i die sure to dissolve and destroy me all through that would set you higher in heaven serve you and leave you happy when clean forgotten as a dead man out of mind am i  your lithe hands draw me your face burns through me i am swift to follow you keen to see but love lacks might to redeem or undo me as i have been i know i shall surely be what should such fellows as i do nay my part were worse if i chose to play for the worst is this after all if they knew me not a soul upon earth would pity me  and i play not for pity of these but you if you saw with your soul what man am i you would praise me at least that my soul all through clove to you loathing the lives that lie the souls and lips that are bought and sold the smiles of silver and kisses of gold the lapdog loves that whine as they chew the little lovers that curse and cry  there are fairer women i hear that may be but i that i love you and find you fair who are more than fair in my eyes if they be do the high gods know or the great gods care though the swords in my heart for one were seven should the iron hollow of doubtful heaven that knows not itself whether nighttime or day be reverberate words and a foolish prayer  i will go back to the great sweet mother mother and lover of men the sea i will go down to her i and none other close with her kiss her and mix her with me cling to her strive with her hold her fast o fair white mother in days long past born without sister born without brother set free my soul as thy soul is free  o fair greengirdled mother of mine sea that art clothed with the sun and the rain thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine thy large embraces are keen like pain save me and hide me with all thy waves find me one grave of thy thousand graves those pure cold populous graves of thine wrought without hand in a world without stain  i shall sleep and move with the moving ships change as the winds change veer in the tide my lips will feast on the foam of thy lips i shall rise with thy rising with thee subside sleep and not know if she be if she were filled full with life to the eyes and hair as a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips with splendid summer and perfume and pride  this woven raiment of nights and days were it once cast off and unwound from me naked and glad would i walk in thy ways alive and aware of thy ways and thee clear of the whole world hidden at home clothed with the green and crowned with the foam a pulse of the life of thy straits and bays a vein in the heart of the streams of the sea  fair mother fed with the lives of men thou art subtle and cruel of heart men say thou hast taken and shalt not render again thou art full of thy dead and cold as they but death is the worst that comes of thee thou art fed with our dead o mother o sea but when hast thou fed on our hearts or when having given us love hast thou taken away  o tenderhearted o perfect lover thy lips are bitter and sweet thine heart the hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover shall they not vanish away and apart but thou thou art sure thou art older than earth thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover from the first thou wert in the end thou art  and grief shall endure not for ever i know as things that are not shall these things be we shall live through seasons of sun and of snow and none be grievous as this to me we shall hear as one in a trance that hears the sound of time the rhyme of the years wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow as tender things of a springtide sea  seafruit that swings in the waves that hiss drowned gold and purple and royal rings and all time past was it all for this times unforgotten and treasures of things swift years of liking and sweet long laughter that wist not well of the years thereafter till love woke smitten at heart by a kiss with lips that trembled and trailing wings  there lived a singer in france of old by the tideless dolorous midland sea in a land of sand and ruin and gold there shone one woman and none but she and finding life for her loves sake fail being fain to see her he bade set sail touched land and saw her as life grew cold and praised god seeing and so died he  died praising god for his gift and grace for she bowed down to him weeping and said live and her tears were shed on his face or ever the life in his face was shed the sharp tears fell through her hair and stung once and her close lips touched him and clung once and grew one with his lips for a space and so drew back and the man was dead  o brother the gods were good to you sleep and be glad while the world endures be well content as the years wear through give thanks for life and the loves and lures give thanks for life o brother and death for the sweet last sound of her feet her breath for gifts she gave you gracious and few tears and kisses that lady of yours  rest and be glad of the gods but i how shall i praise them or how take rest there is not room under all the sky for me that know not of worst or best dream or desire of the days before sweet things or bitterness any more love will not come to me now though i die as love came close to you breast to breast  i shall never be friends again with roses i shall loathe sweet tunes where a note grown strong relents and recoils and climbs and closes as a wave of the sea turned back by song there are sounds where the souls delight takes fire face to face with its own desire a delight that rebels a desire that reposes i shall hate sweet music my whole life long  the pulse of war and passion of wonder the heavens that murmur the sounds that shine the stars that sing and the loves that thunder the music burning at heart like wine an armed archangel whose hands raise up all senses mixed in the spirits cup till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder  these things are over and no more mine  these were a part of the playing i heard once ere my love and my heart were at strife love that sings and hath wings as a bird balm of the wound and heft of the knife fairer than earth is the sea and sleep than overwatching of eyes that weep now time has done with his one sweet word the wine and leaven of lovely life  i shall go my ways tread out my measure fill the days of my daily breath with fugitive things not good to treasure do as the world doth say as it saith but if we had loved each other  o sweet had you felt lying under the palms of your feet the heart of my heart beating harder with pleasure to feel you tread it to dust and death   ah had i not taken my life up and given all that life gives and the years let go the wine and honey the balm and leaven the dreams reared high and the hopes brought low come life come death not a word be said should i lose you living and vex you dead i never shall tell you on earth and in heaven if i cry to you then will you hear or know

 twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky  when the blazing sun is gone when he nothing shines upon then you show your little light twinkle twinkle all the night  then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark how could he see where to go if you did not twinkle so  in the dark blue sky you keep often through my curtains peep for you never shut your eye till the sun is in the sky  as your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark though i know not what you are twinkle twinkle little star

 i seem to wake and sleep ambiguously to see and misconceive to feel on the brink of something that doesn’t end beauty that is more than beautiful meaning that is more   the present is all around me dreams a panoply of crimes smudges of erasure memory made of clouds camels weasels and the unlikelihood of somewhere within and beyond this world   here’s light angular ubiquitous with the milky pigments of belief here’s plodding time breathing hard birds fly up perch on branches peck seed from the grass tug worms from the soil i am not what i imagined here i am the illusionist and dupe of my illusions making the angels disappear wishing them back again   stories that shifted in the telling once were true a virgin birth a resurrection a tiger who regained his human form a crocodile who didn’t i’m pitching words against the sea it drags them out flings them back again still freighted with my weight the waves are red with blood   brown with shit yellow with the sickly light anything but blue and green i am an insistent fizz and drone deft adroit as elastic as necessity and chance   one more clay figurine with beseeching hollows where the eyes should be as different from the others as i am the same no more evolved than a roach no better than a rat happy as a labrador in the sun this is grace the rest is commentary and i would let it go in millennia   i’ll chatter metaphysics with a chimpanzee now my thoughts are the antlers of the irish elk the wings of flightless birds peptides spelling out the phrase very like a whale most organisms   produce more offspring than can possibly survive nothing can follow that something will blunt heads of rain faithless wind the stricken sun at dusk   knockkneed girls somersaulting on the beach the commonplace surprise of making love face to face the heart breaking apart an instrumental eye and instrumental mind rejoicing a last cacophony of birds

 comet of stillness princess of what is over high note held without trembling without voice without sound aura of complete darkness keeper of the kept secrets of the destroyed stories the escaped dreams the sentences never caught in words warden of where the river went touch of its surface sibyl of the extinguished window onto the hidden place and the other time at the foot of the wall by the road patient without waiting in the full moonlight of autumn at the hour when i was born you no longer go out like a flame at the sight of me you are still warmer than the moonlight gleaming on you even now you are unharmed even now perfect as you have always been now when your light paws are running on the breathless night on the bridge with one end i remember you when i have heard you the soles of my feet have made answer when i have seen you i have waked and slipped from the calendars from the creeds of difference and the contradictions that were my life and all the crumbling fabrications as long as it lasted until something that we were had ended when you are no longer anything let me catch sight of you again going over the wall and before the garden is extinct and the woods are figures guttering on a screen let my words find their own places in the silence after the animals

 late i have come to a parched land doubting my gift if gift i have the inspiration of water spilt swallowed in the sand  to hear once more water trickle to stand in a stretch of silence the divining pen twisting in the hand sign of depths alluvial  water owns no permanent shape sags is most itself descending now under the shadow of the idol dry mouth and dry landscape  no rain falls with a refreshing sound to settle tubular in a well elliptical in a bowl no grape lusciously moulds it round  clouds have no constant resemblance to anything blown by a hot wind flying mirages the blue background light constructions of chance  to hold back chaos i transformed amorphous massand fire and cloud so that the agèd gods might dance and golden structures form  i should have built plain brick on brick a water tower the sun flies on arid wastes barren hells too warm and me with a hazel stick  rivulets vanished in the dust long ago great compositions vaporized salt on the tongue so thick that drinking still i thirst  repeated desert recurring drought sometimes hearing water trickle sometimes not i by doubting first believe believing doubt

 to the memory of a friend  drowned off water island april 1960 finally from your house there is no view the bay’s blind mirror shattered over you and patchogue took your body like a log the wind rolled up to shore the senseless drowned have faces nobody would care to see but water loves those gradual erasures of flesh and shoreline greenery and glass and you belonged to water it to you having built on a hillock above the bay your house the bay giving you reason to where now if seasons still are running straight the horseshoe crabs clank armor night and day their couplings far more ancient than the eyes that watched them from your porch i saw one once whose back was a history of how we live grown onto every inch of plate except where the hinges let it move were living things barnacles mussels water weedsand one blue bit of polished glass glued there by time the origins of art it carried them with pride it seemed as if endurance only matters in the end or so i thought  skimming traffic lights starboard and port steer through planted poles that mark the way and other lights across the bay faint stars lining the border of long island’s shore come on at night they still come on at night though who can see them now i do not know wild roses at your back porch break their blood and bud to test surprises of sea air and the birds fly over gliding down to feed at the two feeding stations you set out with seed or splash themselves in a big bowl of rain you used to fill with water going across that night too fast too dark no one will know maybe you heard the last you’ll ever hear the cry of the savage and endemic gull which shakes the blood and always brings to mind the thought that death the scavenger is blind blunders and is stupid and the end comes with ironies so fine the seed falters in the marsh and the heron stops hunting in the weeds below your landing stairs standing in a stillness that now is yours

 in winter all the singing is in the tops of the trees where the windbird  with its white eyes shoves and pushes among the branches like any of us  he wants to go to sleep but hes restless he has an idea and slowly it unfolds  from under his beating wings as long as he stays awake but his big round music after all is too breathy to last  so its over in the pinecrown he makes his nest hes done all he can  i dont know the name of this bird i only imagine his glittering beak tucked in a white wing while the clouds  which he has summoned from the north which he has taught to be mild and silent  thicken and begin to fall into the world below like stars or the feathers of some unimaginable bird  that loves us that is asleep now and silent that has turned itself into snow

 i wrap the blue towel after washing around the damp weight of hair bulky as a sleeping cat and sit out on the porch still dripping water it’ll be dry by supper by the time the dust settles off your shoes though it’s only five past noon think of the luxury how to use the afternoon like the stretch of lawn spread before me there’s the laundry sunwarm clothes at twilight and the mountain of beans in my lap each one i’ll break and snap thoughtfully in half  but there is this slow arousal the small buttons of my cotton blouse are pulling away from my body i feel the strain of threads the swollen magnolias heavy as a flock of birds in the tree already the orange sponge cake is rising in the oven i know you’ll say it makes your mouth dry and i’ll watch you drench your slice of it in canned peaches and lick the plate clean  so much hair my mother used to say grabbing the thick braided rope in her hands while we washed the breakfast dishes discussing dresses and pastries my mind often elsewhere as we did the morning chores together sometimes a few strands would catch in her gold ring i worked hard then anticipating the hour when i would let the rope down at night strips of sheets knotted and tied while she slept in tight blankets my hair freshly washed like a measure of wealth like a bridal veil crouching in the grass you would wait for the signal for the movement of curtains before releasing yourself from the shadow of moths cloth hair and hands smuggling you in

 the obvious is difficult to prove many prefer the hidden i did too i listened to the trees  they had a secret which they were about to make known to me and then didn’t  summer came each tree on my street had its own scheherazade my nights were a part of their wild  storytelling we were entering dark houses more and more dark houses hushed and abandoned  there was someone with eyes closed on the upper floors the thought of it and the wonder kept me sleepless  the truth is bald and cold said the woman who always wore white she didn’t leave her room much  the sun pointed to one or two things that had survived the long night intact the simplest things  difficult in their obviousness they made no noise it was the kind of day people describe as “perfect”  gods disguising themselves as black hairpins a handmirror a comb with a tooth missing no that wasn’t it  just things as they are unblinking lying mute in that bright light and the trees waiting for the night

 and then i thought can i have more of this would it be possible for every day to be a greater awakening more light more light your face on the pillow with the sleep creases rudely fragmenting it hair so stiff from paint and sheet rock it feels like the dirty short hank of mane i used to grab on dandy’s neck before he hauled me up and forward white flanks flecked green with shit and the satin of his dander the livingness the warmth of all that blood just under the skin and in the long thick muscle of the neck he was smarter than most of the children i went to school with he knew how to stand with just the crescent of his hoof along a boot toe and press incrementally his whole weight down the pain so surprising when it came its iron intention sheathed in stealth the decisive sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof pinned one’s foot completely to the ground we’d have to beat and beat him with a brush to push him off that hot insistence with its large horse eye trained deliberately on us to watch  like us he knew how to announce through violence how he didn’t hunger didn’t want despite our practiced ministrations too young not to try to empathize with this cunning this thing that was and was not human we must respect for itself and not our imagination of it i loved him because i could not love him anymore in the ways i’d taught myself watching the slim bodies of teenagers guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring as if they were one body one fluid motion of electric understanding i would never feel working its way through fingers to the bit this thing had a name a need a personality it possessed an indifference that gave me logic and a measure i too might stop wanting the hand placed on back or shoulder and never feel the desired response i loved the horse for the pain it could imagine  and inflict on me the sudden jerking of head away from halter the tentative nose inspecting first before it might decide to relent and eat i loved what was not slave or instinct that when you turn to me it is a choice it is always a choice to imagine pleasure might be blended one warmth bleeding into another as the future bleeds into the past more light more light your hand against my shoulder the image of the one who taught me disobedience is the first right of being alive

 the length of the wind runs from midmay to murder the length of the wind runs from january through joy the wind runs as long as the right hand’s first finger points to the sun after thunder the wind gallops prayerward like a horse held in the palm of a rock no taller than a knee bent for the sake of singing the wind weighs more than the fossilized horse and stretches from fingernail to praise the length of the wind runs from midmay to mercy january through justice unto the broken dwelling in a broken promised land the wind drops a hammer and some are warmed and some are chilled and some laugh and some die silently through the nuclear physicist the wind wicks loud as paperscraps trailing in the wind’s wake igniting an empiricist fragrant through tallow the wind strikes the wind like rice in a paddy the wind scatters petals like blossoms of napalm the wind snaps the backs of malnourished conquistadors bowed down to gold it is the wind who estimates poverty in moments by the method of moments who assesses want in units of amass it is the wind who shakes america by the ovaries runs the length of revolution all the calories in a dollar the length of the wind runts from midmarch to hunger the length of the wind grunts from saturday through sorrow the wind flutters nothing but orgasms and afterplay the wind numbers seminarians more numinous than semen the wind is a mote on the wind the wind is the dust that measures time in footsteps the wind is the word in the throat of the dust the length of the wind runs from midwife to marvel the wind ribbons out within midmay and mourning and dust is the voice the wind whickers glory the wind whickers grief

 for angela  the windigo is a flesheating wintry demon with a man buried deep inside of it in some chippewa stories a young girl vanquishes this monster by forcing boiling lard down its throat thereby releasing the human at the core of ice you knew i was coming for you little one when the kettle jumped into the fire towels flapped on the hooks and the dog crept off groaning to the deepest part of the woods  in the hackles of dry brush a thin laughter started up mother scolded the food warm and smooth in the pot and called you to eat but i spoke in the cold trees new one i have come for you child hide and lie still  the sumac pushed sour red cones through the air copper burned in the raw wood you saw me drag toward you oh touch me i murmured and licked the soles of your feet you dug your hands into my pale melting fur  i stole you off a huge thing in my bristling armor steam rolled from my wintry arms each leaf shivered from the bushes we passed until they stood naked spread like the cleaned spines of fish  then your warm hands hummed over and shoveled themselves full of the ice and the snow i would darken and spill all night running until at last morning broke the cold earth and i carried you home a river shaking in the sun

 the night’s drifts pile up below me and behind my back slide down the hill rise again and build eerie little dunes on the roof of the house in the valley below me miles between me and the town of stjeannet the road lamps glow they are so cold they might as well be dark trucks and cars cough and drone down there between the golden coffins of greenhouses the startled squawk of a rooster claws heavily across a grove and drowns the gumming snarl of some grouchy dog sounds and a man bitterly shifts his broken gears true night still hangs on mist cluttered with a racket of its own  now on the mountainside a little way downhill among turning rocks a square takes form in the side of a dim wall i hear a bucket rattle or something tinny no other stirring behind the dim face of the goatherd’s house i imagine his goats are still sleeping dreaming of the fresh roses beyond the walls of the greenhouse below them and of lettuce leaves opening in tunisia  i turn and somehow impossibly hovering in the air over everything the mediterranean nearer to the moon than this mountain is shines a voice clearly tells me to snap out of it galway mutters out of the house and up the stone stairs to start the motor the moon and the stars suddenly flicker out and the whole mountain appears pale as a shell  look the sea has not fallen and broken our heads how can i feel so warm here in the dead center of january i can scarcely believe it and yet i have to this is the only life i have i get up from the stone my body mumbles something unseemly and follows me now we are all sitting here strangely on top of the sunlight

 1 but i was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer exhausted you lay your head on the kitchen table and said “but what’s the difference between a monster and a cyborg i need something to eat do you have any chocolate” opening the fridge i said quietly and perhaps too seriously trying to impress you “the monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances” her fate her body great britain you said “so is laloo english or british” i said “she’s from london” but the more i said london the more it sounded like a joke londonlondonlondon  2 i was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car this is something you can only do here wish for something did you ever do it wish you weren’t there i want that go on go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the panama canal or idaho hitchhiking in idaho as a veritable child i was taken in by a farming couple fatty and daddy a hundred miles or so outside of boise fatty was rail thin about seventyfive and daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife they picked me up in their trucki was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingersand i stayed with them for five days they said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called country buffet in my innocence i had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a kkk leaderoperative charles reynold what is an operative it is someone who is always planning a way in like the henhouse fox with his beautifully red bushy tail daddy fatty and i hunkered down until daddy’s nephew robert stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to boise proper where there was a bus station i waited until robert had gone and then i walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers “i can take you as far as the state line” “that would be lovely” obsessed far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at heathrow airport or nestle the main employers in the dingy part of northwest london that constituted my origins i said yes soft yes to the color green which is going  3 that is a tree going but also an ocean a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me for you it might happen in another place mine like laloo i lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows thus a juniper tree flying by the window intensely blue or the atlantic ocean to the left if the car has a destination to the south such as to the keys is magical to me improbable in light of my origins hers the girl in the car i don’t know i am writing to you in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it the dress the morning of writing ahead of you is a café as if writing you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself for this reason when i think of you reading i think of you as writing blindly you read but you are also writing as if my own eyes were closed i see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl these books are separate from my own work here in the saltwater notebook but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense like birds  4 this is pre but the notebook is after soaked already at the edge and foamy past future writing on the warp when dry pages entries by hand that is the morning i woke up and walked to the pacific ocean after a night in a motel in florence oregon complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows the woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it an expatriate she said exaggeratedly oblivious to our common origin “about four miles you’re not going to walk are you do you have an umbrella you can’t go out like that ducky”  5 i walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up on its forested proximal verge by gorse which is a bright yellow flower citronyellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it the day like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain monsoon what kind of rain is this i recognized the immensity but not the temperature this was monstrous the inability to assimilate on the level of the senses an ordinary experience of weather here is the tongue for example constantly darting out to feel the air what is it is it summer is it a different season it’s a different day that’s okay damaged from her travels in some sense unsettled enormously anxious a girl does it anway gets up and goes it’s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around

 they listen to the myna birds dicker in the grass the child’s blue shoes are caked with garden dirt when he runs she sees the antics of a pair of wrens she works the garden  a pot of rusting gardenias has given off its ales and infused the danker germinations of her grief she watches her son chase pigeons kick at the leaves piled high now a magpie  adds to his cascades of laughter as he runs with the hose pours a fine spray happy to be giving to the grass this silver courtship she sighs watches the drops settle in today who  can explain the sadness she feels surely this day is to be treasured the sun out the breeze like a cat’s tongue licking a moon of milk her son expending himself in small public  bursts happy among clover where bees hover and unfold centrefolds of nectar today who can explain the heaviness in her head as if all her worries were tomes toward a larger work  one she knows she will never finish but to which she must keep adding thought by thought she sweeps the petals smells their russet imprint soon dusk will come with an envoy of smoke  and her son outlast her patience by a rose already he is tiring puling at the flowers it won’t be long before they’ll go in listen to the jug purr comfort he’ll sleep and she’ll  lie back or get up to unhook the cry of her cat from the wire door now a few cicadas are idling giving each other the gun and a cockatoo calls a haughty felon she sighs knowing she won’t  escape her mood today the turned earth or its rank persuasions her child’s petulance flaring like an orchid or a cockatoo’s unruly crest today she knows she will need to consider  her unhappiness of what she is a prisoner – if not the loss of hope’s particulars her son soaks the path rinses the sky of its featureless blue he is giving that water now to everything

 yesterday the sunshine made the air glow pushing me like a sixteenyearold to toss my shirt off and run along the river shore splashing in the water wading out to the reeds my heart an ancient yaki drum and i believed more than believed the air beneath trees was female blue dancers i approached and there in the dry leaves in the crisp twigs i turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air sunlight in shrubweed skirts i knew the dance that would please the gods i knew the dance that would make the river water smile glistening ever silvering i knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors  yeah i wanted to write you a poem woman for two days and today it was gray and snowy and overcast about how i startled the mallards from their shallow refuge beneath the russian olive trees and how the male purposely came close to me diverting my attention to it its female love went the other way risking its life thats what i saw the male fly before the hunters rifles circle in sights of hunters and take the shots the roaring rifle blast after blast and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion  thats how i miss you thats how i wanted to write you a poem since we left you one way me another way i was the male taking with me the hunters that would harm you risking my heart so yours wouldnt be hurt fronting myself as possible prey so you could escape that kind of poem i am writing you now  circling as hunters aim down on me while you rise rise rise into the blue sky and meet me over in the next fields  i wanted to write you a poem for two days now to tell you how happy i was seeing a white crane arc between banks in the irrigation ditch with furious efforts its big wings flapping like an awkward nineyearold kid much taller than the others his age with size twelve sneakers flapping down the basketball court  but once the white crane found its balance its wings their grace it glided more perfectly than a ballet dancers leap across air all of its feathers ballet dancers toes all of its feathers delicate dancers all of its feathers in motion made me believe in myself but more when it rose swooped up the line of ascent up made me think of the curve of your spine how i traced my finger down your spine when you slept your spine is the ascent of the crane toward the sunshine and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips became air a blue cold artic air you glided up in your song of winter love
