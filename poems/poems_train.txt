NEW POEM
 my economy is circular: i earn money from an institution that owns most of the businesses where i tend to spend most of my money.  my economy is quasi-medieval, trade-centered, and guild-like.  my economy is not canonical.  my economy is a misfortune that recently befell me.  my economy admits foundational narratives.  my economy is language.  my economy is the executioner’s reversal of fortune.  my economy has no essential features.  my economy admits parallax critiques of ideology.  my economy owes something to over 4,136 dead soldiers.  my economy does not intimate and would rather not split hairs about what belongs to whom.  my economy can’t stay out of things, but can’t make it into the thick of things either.  my economy has questionable purchasing power.  my economy has no surrogate.  my economy has no interpretative skills but is rife with interpretative communi- ties.  my economy is of trees chopped down in brooklyn, and the gradual encir- cling of brick.  my economy is the new red.  my economy thrives on shades of gray.  my economy is an unremarkable tuna sandwich that is missing the slices of tomato that i had asked for.  my economy is a liter bottle of poland spring water coming not from poland but from maine and bought at a university cafeteria in uptown manhattan where there are quite a number of water foundations that deliver water with a funky metallic aftertaste.  my economy is a poem called “first purchase of the month” consisting of two stanzas with six eight-word lines each within a larger poem that could be endless but won’t be:  could’ve been an outfit for the whitney biennial  couldn’t afford one, nor did i need it.  who cares how you look at the zoo;  it’s about the animals, stupid. which reminds me,  could’ve been the trail mix i snacked on  &amp; which i managed not to purchase myself.    it was tuna on whole wheat, lettuce, jalapeños;  a one liter bottle of water (poland spring.)  asked for tomato too, which the lady forgot.  you puerto rican, she asked? don’t think so,  said another one in spanish. let me answer.  no, what made you think so? the peppers?   my economy needs contractions and abbreviations.  my economy is not fixed.  my economy is broken, mispronounced.  my economy has cold feet, even if there are plenty of socks at home.  my economy would like to be wholesome and sound.  my economy is a gift certificate that is not enough for what i’d like to have, so i end up spending money at a store that i dislike in the first place and will never visit again.  my economy is a business lunch where i end up paying the bill instead of the person who’d like me to work with her.  my economy consists of performing tasks for which i receive no quantifi- able pay.  my economy grows when it’s enough to buy someone else a drink, or a meal.  my economy does not allow me to say no.  my economy pretends to be booming, but instead, is shaky and imploding.  it doesn’t matter, because my economy is predicated on virtue, and it posits that it’s purer than yours.  my economy has no exchange value.  i’d like to think of my economy as one of resistance and tactical difference.  my economy is not a disposable good.  there are no surpluses in my economy.  i already owe what i just wrote.  my economy is derivative, parasitical, and residual.  my economy is a hand-me-down.  my economy is not environmentally friendly, although it’s not ravaging non-renewable resources either.  my economy doesn’t force me to put my money where my mouth is. were i to pay for what i say, it would be a different story.  thirteen cents a word is not fair trade.  my economy mistakes what it means to trade in futures.  in theory my economy is not the result of deliberate choice, it is makeshift and a tag-along.  my economy has double standards.  my economy has attention deficit disorder.  my economy is the symptom of an incurable disease.  my economy is not even mine.   word count: 682

 in his life he neither wrote nor read. in his life he didn’t cut down a single tree, didn’t slit the throat of a single calf. in his life he did not speak of the new york times behind its back, didn’t raise his voice to a soul except in his saying: “come in, please, by god, you can’t refuse.”  —  nevertheless— his case is hopeless, his situation desperate. his god-given rights are a grain of salt tossed into the sea.  ladies and gentlemen of the jury: about his enemies my client knows not a thing. and i can assure you, were he to encounter the entire crew of the aircraft carrier enterprise, he’d serve them eggs sunny-side up, and labneh fresh from the bag.

 i. skin &amp; corn  her brown skin glistens as the sun pours through the kitchen window like gold leche. after grinding the  nixtamal , a word so beautifully ethnic it must not only be italicized but underlined to let you, the reader, know you’ve encountered something beautifully ethnic, she kneads with the hands of centuries-old ancestor spirits who magically yet realistically posses her until the masa is smooth as a lowrider’s chrome bumper. and i know she must do this with care because it says so on a website that explains how to make homemade corn tortillas. so much labor for this peasant bread, this edible art birthed from abuelitas’s brown skin, which is still glistening in the sun.   ii. apology  before she died i called my abuelita grandma. i cannot remember if she made corn tortillas from scratch but, o, how she’d flip the factory fresh el milagros (quality since 1950) on the burner, bathe them in butter &amp; salt for her grandchildren. how she’d knead the buttons on the telephone, order me food from pizza hut. i assure you, gentle reader, this was done with the spirit of mesoamérica ablaze in her fingertips.

 right now i'm sipping a mango lassi in action town. i'm not bereft at all. in fact, i'm pleasantly aware of people moving on all fours. our voice and text messages will be erased in no time. when i walk into stores they call me spark plug because i have a sparky manner. things get all wavy from their constant attention. it's going to be okay. i'm a good habit: you don't need to trick me. i'm not sure where i should put my hands when i walk down the street with you. it's funny to think about who i would call if something really awful happened. i'd be jumping up and down not knowing who to call. my way of doing things is scary even to me. remember the toothbrush, the honey bear, and the meal that we thought would never end? i'm counting on you to come through high water, to come through chaos, and to action town, where we'll lift our aces to skyward aviation.  
NEW POEM
 i wish we could control this revolting want of control: these people with their spongy eyes, their mouths of trembling shoehorns, billhooks for penises and bear traps for vulvas. one taste of sunlight and at once they can’t do without it. water, the same, and food, and air, and a dozen other squalid habits. some—like their copulation, a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck— are not physically compulsive but the partners can’t stop wanting them to be: so we desire to be raped by love, who would fill us, they say, with an oil from the lit braziers of stars. what if, doing it every day, we resemble pistons, and the slow poison cuts our lives off at 70: it’s the grim determination of our passion. and beyond this, even i— defended in childhood by my strong father the piano and my mother the virtuoso from knuckles among warehouses—even i am addicted to the mild light of words.  
NEW POEM
 the trouble was not about finding acceptance. acceptance was available in the depths of the mind and among like people. the trouble was the look into the canyon which had come a long time earlier and spent many years being forgotten.  the fine garments and rows of strong shoes, the pantry stocked with good grains and butter— everything could be earned by producing right answers. answers were important, the canyon said, but the answers were not the solution.  a glimpse into the future had shown the prairie on which houses stood sturdily. the earth was moist and generous, the sunlight benevolent. the homesteaders dreamed up palaces and descendants, and the animals slept soundly as stones.  it was a hard-earned heaven, the self-making of travelers, and often, out on the plains, mirages rose of waterfalls, moose, and rows of fresh-plowed soil, but nobody stopped to drink the false water. real water being plentiful, they were not thirsty.  a few made their fortunes from native beauty, others from native strength, but most from knowledge, as uncertainties in science could be written off to faith. faith was religious and ordinary life physical, and spiritual was a song that had not yet arrived.

 i’d a snip cut in his tongue. blood scissored down his chin. at every squall i’d been unsnibbing myself and starving him. he knocked me so my nose coughed blood, punched a finger through my cornea. blood blubbed on my nipple where his gums met. on the radio somebody was saying something about syria. my son jerked knots of hair from my head, tears dashed off his fontanelle. he’d fixed my hips so my clothes didn’t fit. i blundered him once against the doorjamb: blood. i’d bit his father when we were younger, drinking harder, made blood come then. twice i tried to leave him screaming, twenty minutes at a time, but couldn’t keep schtum. one breakfast i broke the mug that insisted “don’t mess with texas.” smashed it. and all the time i smiled so much my teeth dried. he made everything heavy. like they say the bomb did for a while, so that americans swam through their homes, eyes peeled, picking up everyday things and dropping them as though they were violated with light and pain. as though blood hadn’t always been there, waiting.

 to kill correctly takes calculation.  down to a science. arsenic cacodylic acid.  know water and rice on a cellular level.  make sure no surviving seed can be collected and planted.  because even a small seed assures survival.  because mortars, grenades and bombs cannot destroy a grain.  because our heart is made of seeds.  know what it takes to kill the seeds.  know what it takes to deprive the plant of water, to dehydrate it.  to be surrounded by love but unable to absorb it.

 after reading dr rieu’s translation of st mark’s gospel. who is this that comes in splendour, coming from the blazing east? this is he we had not thought of, this is he the airy christ.  airy, in an airy manner in an airy parkland walking, others take him by the hand, lead him, do the talking.  but the form, the airy one, frowns an airy frown, what they say he knows must be, but he looks aloofly down,  looks aloofly at his feet, looks aloofly at his hands, knows they must, as prophets say, nailèd be to wooden bands.  as he knows the words he sings, that he sings so happily must be changed to working laws, yet sings he ceaselessly.  those who truly hear the voice, the words, the happy song, never shall need working laws to keep from doing wrong.  deaf men will pretend sometimes they hear the song, the words, and make excuse to sin extremely; this will be absurd.  heed it not. whatever foolish men may do the song is cried for those who hear, and the sweet singer does not care that he was crucified.  for he does not wish that men should love him more than anything because he died; he only wishes they would hear him sing.

 because she'd heard him laugh through new moon darkness and she knew he'd fallen and she knew, before she turned, he'd be crawling, like a crawdad, rock to loam—  because she tried to love the straight back and neck he'd erected to recollect the man he'd been before—because she found herself adding up his usefulness  like some kind of auctioneer—she showed him the dark coils areoling both her breasts and all the ways she bent and lifted, bent and lifted, steady, strong.  she let him believe he was past due for a harvest and her hands were the right ones, now, to hold onto the scythe.  •   she made quick work of pleasure. the boysmile bunked down in his eyes, she claimed. her tongue found the place in his mouth where the teeth were gone—where he'd hold his corncakes  until they grew soft enough to chew. history had bedded him in all of this—his own history and failures not his own. before he'd tramped in she'd watched another man—a man she'd thought  she'd hated—watched his body opened, opened, opened until blood had married brine. she'd watch that man be whipped into something good for nothing more than fertilizing clay and she'd thought  buckshot would have been a brand of kindness if sprayed into him just then. but even after his hard going, she did not miss him very much.  •   anyone she chose could be shucked like surplus property tomorrow, but that hadn't been enough to warn her off of picking him that night. because she knew if she set her sight on nothing she'd get nothing  in return, she'd walked with him. but because the night progressed so —because there were some clouds—no stars—no moon—he'd tripped over the branch of a dead and down tree. in all that darkness,  there, without a moon, even then, she had not fallen. she thought to say so, but she did not say so. she did nothing but say she was sorry for him. she did not use her mouth  to say this. could he not listen to her hands? they spoke softly, articulating her condolences, to his torn and bleeding skin.

i do not know   i can only hold it to the strangeness in man and america has grown into the american way— to be young is to be ever purposeful   limitless to grow is to know limit   purposelessness each age is a new age how outrageous it is that something old and sad from the pre-age incorporates each new age— do i say the declaration of independence is old? yes i say what was good for 1789, is not good for 1960 it was right and new to say all men were created equal because it was a light then but today it is tragic to say it today it should be fact— man has been on earth a long time one would think with his mania for growth he would, by now, have outgrown such things as constitutions manifestos codes commandments that he could well live in the world without them and know instinctively how to live and be —for what is being but the facility to love? was not that the true goal of growth, love? was not that christ? but man is strange and grows where he will and chalks it all up to fate   whatever be— america rings with such strangeness it has grown into something strange and the american is good example of this mad growth the boy man   big baby meat as though the womb were turned backwards giving birth to an old man the victory that is man does not allow man to top off his empirical achievement with death the aztecs did it by yanking out young hearts at the height of their power the americans are doing it by feeding their young to the way for it was not the spaniard who killed the aztec but the aztec who killed the aztec rome is proof   greece is proof   all history is proof victory does not allow degeneracy it will not be the communists will kill america no   but america itself— the american way   that sad mad process is not run by any one man or organization it is a monster born of itself   existing of its self the men who are employed by this monster are employed unknowingly they reside in the higher echelons of intelligence they are the educators the psychiatrists the ministers the writers the politicians the communicators the rich the entertainment world and some follow and sing the way because they sincerely believe it to be good and some believe it holy and become minutemen in it some are in it simply to be in and most are in it for gold they do not see the way as monster they see it as the “good life” what is the way? the way was born out of the american dream a nightmare— the state of americans today compared to the americans of the 18th century proves the nightmare— not franklin not jefferson who speaks for america today but strange red-necked men of industry and the goofs of show business bizarre! frightening! the mickey mouse sits on the throne and hollywood has a vast supply— could grammar school youth seriously look upon a picture of george washington and “herman borst” the famous night club comedian together at valley forge? old old and decadent   gone the dignity the american sun seems headed for the grave o that youth might raise it anew! the future depends solely on the young the future is the property of the young what the young know the future will know what they are and do the future will be and do what has been done must not be done again will the american way allow this? no. i see in every american express and in every army center in europe i see the same face the same sound of voice the same clothes the same walk i see mothers &amp; fathers no difference among them replicas they not only speak and walk and think alike they have the same face! what did this monstrous thing? what regiments a people so? how strange is nature’s play on america surely were lincoln alive today he could never be voted president   not with his looks— indeed americans are babies all in the embrace of mama way did not ike, when he visited the american embassy in paris a year ago, say to the staff—“everything is fine, just drink coca cola, and everything will be all right.” this is true, and is on record did not american advertising call for togetherness? not orgiasticly like today’s call nor as means to stem violence this is true, and is on record. are not the army centers in europe ghettos? they are, and o how sad   how lost! the px newsstands are filled with comic books the army movies are always doris day what makes a people huddle so? why can’t they be universal? who has smalled them so? this is serious! i do not mock or hate this i can only sense some mad vast conspiracy! helplessness is all it is! they are caught   caught in the way— and those who seek to get out of the way can not the beats are good example of this they forsake the way’s habits and acquire for themselves their own habits and they become as distinct and regimented and lost as the main flow because the way has many outlets like a snake of many tentacles— there is no getting out of the way the only way out is the death of the way and what will kill the way but a new consciousness something great and new and wonderful must happen to free man from this beast it is a beast we can not see or even understand for it be the condition of our minds god how close to science fiction it all seems! as if some power from another planet incorporated itself in the minds of us all it could well be! for as i live i swear america does not seem like america to me  americans are a great people i ask for some great and wondrous event that will free them from the way and make them a glorious purposeful people once again i do not know if that event is due   deserved or even possible i can only hold that man is the victory of life and i hold firm to american man  i see standing on the skin of the way america   to be as proud and victorious as st. michael on the neck of the fallen lucifer—

 most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade, with which that happy name was first design'd: the which three times thrice happy hath me made, with gifts of body, fortune, and of mind. the first my being to me gave by kind, from mother's womb deriv'd by due descent, the second is my sovereign queen most kind, that honour and large richesse to me lent. the third my love, my life's last ornament, by whom my spirit out of dust was raised: to speak her praise and glory excellent, of all alive most worthy to be praised. ye three elizabeths for ever live, that three such graces did unto me give.

NEW POEM
 how can we die when we're already prone to leaving the table mid-meal like ancient ones gone to breathe elsewhere. salt sits still, but pepper's gone rolled off in a rush. we've practiced dying for a long time: when we skip dance or town, when we chew. we've rounded out like dining room walls in a canyon, eaten through by wind—sorry we rushed off; the food wasn't ours. sorry the grease sits white on our plates, and the jam that didn't set— use it as syrup to cover every theory of us.  
NEW POEM
 it was a time when they were afraid of him. my father, a bare man, a gypsy, a horse with broken knees no one would shoot. then again, he was like the orange tree, and young women plucked from him sweet fruit. to meet him, you must be in the right place, even his sons and daughter, we wondered where was papa now and what was he doing. he held the mystique of travelers that pass your backyard and disappear into the trees. then, when you follow, you find nothing, not a stir, not a twig displaced from its bough. and then he would appear one night. half covered in shadows and half in light, his voice quiet, absorbing our unspoken thoughts. when his hands lay on the table at breakfast, they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home, hands that had not taken us into them and the fingers did not gently rub along our lips. they were hands of a gypsy that filled our home with love and safety, for a moment; with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs, they filled us because of the love in them. beyond the ordinary love, beyond the coordinated life, beyond the sponging of broken hearts, came the untimely word, the fallen smile, the quiet tear, that made us grow up quick and romantic. papa gave us something: when we paused from work, my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields, my brother and i running like deer, we would pause, because we had a papa no one could catch, who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank, he bragged about us: he did not say we were smart, nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday. he said we were good. he held us up to the world for it to see, three children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way, who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom, and that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind, to the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring. he said, “here are my children! care for them!” and he left again, going somewhere like a child with a warrior’s heart, nothing could stop him. my grandmother would look at him for a long time, and then she would say nothing. she chose to remain silent, praying each night, guiding down like a root in the heart of earth, clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast. and i am the blossom of many nights. a threefold blossom: my sister is as she is, my brother is as he is, and i am as i am. through sacred ceremony of living, daily living, arose three distinct hopes, three loves, out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.

 for jerry ward i am the only one here.  i stand in my one place and i can see a good piece down the road. i am yonder, further than the chunk of your stone. right now, directly, i am persimmon falling free and the prisoner opening up in me. don’t come through my door and want to run my house. i am the angel who sweep air in and out my own dancing body. i got good eyes. i can see. a good piece down the road. clear to god murmuring in me. my head is the burning bush. what i hold in my hand is the promised land. i set my people free in me. and we walk without wandering like people named after mere plants, because we are tree and high-stepping roots cake-walking in this promised place.  where i go is where i am now. don’t mess with me: you hurt yourself. in the middle of my stride now. i am walking yes indeed i am walking through my own house. i am walking yes indeed on my own piece of road. toting my own load and yours and mine. i tell you i feel fine and clear this morning even when it’s night and a full moon with my thumbprint on it. everything is clamorous and quiet. i am the only one here. and we don’t break. no indeed. come hell and high water. we don’t break for nothing.

 for don and henrie gordon forty-odd years ago— headlines in the snow— the jobless scrawled a text for mutineers; then history seemed sane, though franco sailed for spain and hitler swore to live a thousand years.  now progress, his machine, makes water out of wine; with loaves and paper stuffs the multitude; for power he milks the sun to see the cities flame and drives the goddess from the sacred wood.  yet anniversaries should have our praise, as trees salute the queenly coming of the spring. all sacred marriages keep evergreen in this: coupling with time, they bind him in a ring.  though time turns, history moves as if to prove our loves, having no pattern but the one we give. while countries bleed and burn not any shall sleep warm unless, good friends, you teach us how to live.  some nine and forty years, a pulse-beat of the stars, astounds the may fly’s million generations. your middle style of time is suited most to man. this whispering wrist sustains the dream of nations.

 from a newspaper photo and article about my godfather, james moreno, east los angeles, 1950.  (three police officers took a brutal beating in a wild free-for-all with a family, including three young girls. from left, james, 19, and alex, 22, in jail after the fracas on the porch of their home at 3307 hunter.)  jimmy is staring off the page, hands in his pockets. a four-button dark shirt. no bruises, but he looks dazed. alex wears a leather coat and a polka-dot shirt, which is in itself a crime. nowhere is there a photo of a young girl with a face carved like a racetrack saint, eyes with all bets called off, grinning like a coyote.  (officer parks had his glasses broken with his own sap and was thrown through a window.)  jimmy and alex are my dad’s cousins, lived on boyle heights and tortillas. mama says the cops always harassed them, those niños from east l.a., driving their low-riders, chrome shinier than a cop’s badge. and why wasn’t coyote girl mentioned, that round-armed girl with a punch like a bag of bees, a girl with old eyes, her lips cracking open as she saw the cop sailing through glass, boiling out of boyle heights, skidding on the sidewalk, flat as a tortilla?  (the officers received severe cuts and bruises, were treated at a hospital and released in time to jail the youths, who were charged with assault with a deadly weapon.)  two years later, i was born and jimmy entered the church, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched, watching the christening. four drops of water, like popped-off wafer-thin buttons, fell on my head. no. he never showed up that day or any other. my spiritual guardian must’ve been there in spirit only. he didn’t know nada about got and no one knows where he is today, but i think you could find him at the end of a knife. or in the slash of the z in ¡la raza! the dark blood reds of graffiti. or tomatoes grown in old coffee cans by a white-haired man sitting in the sun in a dark shirt, next to an old woman growing younger every day as i tell her story, my story, our story with all the grace and power of a deadly weapon.  
NEW POEM
 what i walked down to the highway for, through the summer dawn, was the sunday funnies, or so i thought— but what i remember reading there in the shadowless light among meadowlarks singing was tracks in the deep warm dust of the lane, where it parted with its beige dryness the meadow’s dew— the sleek trail where a snake had crossed and slid into tall grass; the stippled parallels with marks between them where a black blister-beetle had dragged its bulbous belly across in search of weeds more green; the labyrinth of lacelike dimples left by a speed-freak tiger-beetles’s sprints that ended where it took wing with a little blur of dust-grains; and stepping through the beetle-trails, the wedge-heels and sharp-clawed hands of skunk-track crossing unhurried and walking along the ditch to find an easy place for climbing; not far past that, a line of cat-prints running straight down the lane and ending with deep marks where it leaped across the ditch to the meadow for birds asleep or wandering baby rabbits: and freshly placed this morning, the slender runes of bob-whites running, scuffles of dustbaths taken— and there ahead crouched low at the lane-edge under purple pokeweed-berries four quail had seen me, and when i walked slowly on toward them, instead of flying they ran with a fluid scuttling on down the lane and stopped frozen till i came too close —then quietly when i expected an explosion of wings they took off low and whispering and sailed, rocking and tilting out over the meadow’s tall bluestem, dropped down and were gone until i heard them whistling, down by the little pond, and whistled back so sharply that when i got back to the  house they still were answering and one flew into the elm and whistled from its shadows up over the porch where i sat reading the funnies while the kittens played with the headlines till when the first gold sunlight tipped the elm’s leaves he flew back out to the meadow and sank down into the sun-brilliant dew on curving wings, and my brothers and sisters waked by the whistling came pouring out onto the porch and claimed their share of the sunday funnies— and i went on to read the headlines of world war two, with maps of the struggling armies leaving tank-tracks over the dunes of libya and the navies churning their wakes of phosphorescence in the coral sea where the ships went down on fire and the waves bobbed and flamed with the maimed survivors , screaming in japanese or english until their gasoline-blistered heads sank down to the tiger sharks and the war was lost or won for children sitting in sunlight, believing their cause was just and knowing it would prevail, as the dew vanished away.

 the water sings along our keel, the wind falls to a whispering breath; i look into your eyes and feel no fear of life or death; so near is love, so far away the losing strife of yesterday.  we watch the swallow skim and dip; some magic bids the world be still; life stands with finger upon lip; love hath his gentle will; though hearts have bled, and tears have burned, the river floweth unconcerned.  we pray the fickle flag of truce still float deceitfully and fair; our eyes must love its sweet abuse; this hour we will not care, though just beyond to-morrow's gate, arrayed and strong, the battle wait.

 let the boy try along this bayonet-blade how cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood; blue with all malice, like a madman's flash; and thinly drawn with famishing for flesh.  lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-leads, which long to nuzzle in the hearts of lads, or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth sharp with the sharpness of grief and death.  for his teeth seem for laughing round an apple. there lurk no claws behind his fingers supple; and god will grow no talons at his heels, nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.

 to grasp, like prometheus, the fire — without  the power to give it away ...  — betty adcock at first a silhouette on the horizon, then turning solid, like schiller coming up the path to meet the adorable sisters, and they, pretending not to watch,  their hearts, all the time, pounding, driven by the same spring force (that would  tear them apart), the same force that drives the salmon upriver, against the current, the odds, back to the home pool, even as the autumn mind, in spite of itself,  turns backward, with the same feverish glow as autumn gives to the summer’s leaves, a deceptive glamour, warming the past with an amber light, like brandy held up to the fire, or the sun sinking at dusk into the water, into the baltic sea each night, where, in the mythical depths  of lithuanian folktale, lies the amber castle of the female sun, burning in the dark water, a globe the color of harvest, aglow there in the depths of the past, though the amber, congealed sap of a once  living force, is broken into bits, and the mythic castle with it — strung now as beads, and hung, a charm, around the neck of a daughter, like the one in a greek dream, picking flowers when the earth opened,  and in a swirl of violet cape and the pounding of hoofs, the dark god broke out of the earth driven by the same spring force, consequential and mortal, and up there, hanging over the mythic  fields of what recurs and recurs (though never the same, and never to be reconciled) — what is that? a hot air balloon filled  with passengers who paid to be raised in a basket, to be up there looking down on the ground where they live, a place shrunken now beneath their gaze, while their bloated shadow floats like a jellyfish in a green sea, barely a smudge on the pastures below, the trace of their passage less than a breath of smoke from a coal-fired engine — a blast of tarnished air from the actual past, heavy metal delivered from memory. useless to warn the girl, whose  hand will always be reaching out for the flowers, or the sisters inflamed with schiller, as he with the tricolor dream of a world he could never inhabit ... useless to comfort  the eyeless tiresias who knew how terrible was wisdom when it knew itself useless, and useless to read  the names on the shining black wall of the vietnam memorial, the text of exactly what war has accomplished — and look, there, standing high above the tragic scene,  not the little figures of the wise ancients that yeats saw carved into the deep blue stone — but there, standing high above arlington, against the blank lapis of the sky: a horse with the torso and head of a man, yes, it is chiron, the last of the hybrids, the wise and terribly wounded centaur for whom immortality was a curse, and he gave it away  to prometheus, who stole the god’s fire and gave it away, as art gives the power to give it away, for that fire is the gift that cannot be held, for it will burn to an ash those (born and born again, war without end) who would hold it.

 there are  at  least two  types of people,  the  first for  whom the  ordinary worldliness is easy.  the  regular  social routines  and  material  cares  are nothing too external to them and easily absorbed. they are not alien from the  creation  and  maintenance of the world, and the world does not treat them  as  alien. and also, from  them, the efforts  toward the world, and to them,  the  fulfillment  of the  world's  moderate desires, flow. they are ef- fortless at eating, moving, arranging their arms as they sit or stand,  being hired, being paid, cleaning up,  spending, playing, mating.  they are in an ease and comfort. the world is for the world and for them.  then there are those over whom the events and opportunities of the every- day  world wash  over.  there  is  rarely,  in this  second type, any easy kind of absorption.  there  is only  a  visible  evidence  of having  been made of a different  substance,  one that  repels.  also, from them,  it is almost impos- sible  to  give  to  the  world  what  it will  welcome or reward. for how does this  second  type  hold  their arms?  across their chest? behind their back? and  how  do  they  find  food  to eat  and  then prepare this food? and how do  they  receive  a  check or endorse it? and what also of the difficulties of love  or  being loved, its  expansiveness,  the way it is used for markets and indentured moods?  and what is this  second  substance?  and how does it come  to have as one of  its  qualities  the  resistance of the world  as it is?  and also,  what is  the person  made  of  the  second  substance?   is this a  human or more or  less than one? where is the true impermeable community of the second human whose  arms  do  not  easily  arrange  themselves and for whom the salaries and  weddings  and  garages do not come?  these are, perhaps, not two sorts of persons, but two kinds of fortune. the first is soft and regular. the second is a baffled kind, and magnetic only  to the second substance, and made itself out of a different, second, substance, and having, at its end, a second, and almost blank-faced, reward.

 the sun rose over the sweep of the hill all bare for the gathered hay, and a blackbird sang by the window-sill, and a girl knelt down to pray: ‘whom thou hast kept through the night, o lord, keep thou safe through the day.’  the sun rose over the shell-swept height, the guns are over the way, and a soldier turned from the toil of the night to the toil of another day, and a bullet sang by the parapet to drive in the new-turned clay.  the sun sank slow by the sweep of the hill, they had carried all the hay, and a blackbird sang by the window-sill, and a girl knelt down to pray: ‘keep thou safe through the night, o lord, whom thou hast kept through the day.’  the sun sank slow by the shell-swept height, the guns had prepared a way, and a soldier turned to sleep that night who would not wake for the day, and a blackbird flew from the window-sill, when a girl knelt down to pray.  
NEW POEM
 in those days, though, i never analysed myself even. all analysis comes late. you catch a sight of nature, earliest, in full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink and drop before the wonder of ‘t; you miss the form, through seeing the light. i lived, those days, and wrote because i lived–unlicensed else: my heart beat in my brain. life’s violent flood abolished bounds,–and, which my neighbour’s field, which mine, what mattered? it is so in youth. we play at leap-frog over the god term; the love within us and the love without are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love, we scarce distinguish. so, with other power. being acted on and acting seem the same: in that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels, we know not if the forests move or we. and so, like most young poets, in a flush of individual life, i poured myself along the veins of others, and achieved mere lifeless imitations of life verse, and made the living answer for the dead, profaning nature. ‘touch not, do not taste, nor handle,’–we’re too legal, who write young: we beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs, as if still ignorant of counterpoint; we call the muse ... ‘o muse, benignant muse!’– as if we had seen her purple-braided head. with the eyes in it start between the boughs as often as a stag’s. what make-believe, with so much earnest! what effete results, from virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes from such white heats!–bucolics, where the cows would scare the writer if they splashed the mud in lashing off the flies,–didactics, driven against the heels of what the master said; and counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps a babe might blow between two straining cheeks of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh; and elegiac griefs, and songs of love, like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road, the worse for being warm: all these things, writ on happy mornings, with a morning heart, that leaps for love, is active for resolve, weak for art only. oft, the ancient forms will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood. the wine-skins, now and then, a little warped, will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in. spare the old bottles!–spill not the new wine. by keats’s soul, the man who never stepped in gradual progress like another man, but, turning grandly on his central self, ensphered himself in twenty perfect years and died, not young,–(the life of a long life, distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn for ever;) by that strong excepted soul, i count it strange, and hard to understand, that nearly all young poets should write old; that pope was sexagenarian at sixteen, and beardless byron academical, and so with others. it may be, perhaps, such have not settled long and deep enough in trance, to attain to clairvoyance,–and still the memory mixes with the vision, spoils, and works it turbid. or perhaps, again, in order to discover the muse-sphinx, the melancholy desert must sweep round, behind you, as before.– for me, i wrote false poems, like the rest, and thought them true. because myself was true in writing them. i, peradventure, have writ true ones since with less complacence. but i could not hide my quickening inner life from those at watch. they saw a light at a window now and then, they had not set there. who had set it there? my father’s sister started when she caught my soul agaze in my eyes. she could not say i had no business with a sort of soul, but plainly she objected,–and demurred, that souls were dangerous things to carry straight through all the spilt saltpetre of the world. she said sometimes, ‘aurora, have you done your task this morning?–have you read that book? and are you ready for the crochet here?’– as if she said, ‘i know there’s something wrong, i know i have not ground you down enough to flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust for household uses and proprieties, before the rain has got into my barn and set the grains a-sprouting. what, you’re green with out-door impudence? you almost grow?’ to which i answered, ‘would she hear my task, and verify my abstract of the book? and should i sit down to the crochet work? was such her pleasure?’ ... then i sate and teased the patient needle til it split the thread, which oozed off from it in meandering lace from hour to hour. i was not, therefore, sad; my soul was singing at a work apart behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm as sings the lark when sucked up out of sight, in vortices of glory and blue air. and so, through forced work and spontaneous work, the inner life informed the outer life, reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms, made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams, and, rounding to the spheric soul the thin pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks, though somewhat faint. i clenched my brows across my blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass, and said, ‘we’ll live, aurora! we’ll be strong. the dogs are on us–but we will not die.’

 i sit on the couch &amp; witness my life projected on a screen — i am white w/a chiseled, dimpled chin &amp; no lips. i’m a farmer who lives alone in a loft &amp; not a lowly office worker who lives w/a roommate in an apartment where dust balls decorate the floors &amp; walls &amp; the ceiling rings w/children’s feet running back &amp; forth like baby bulls. i am crazy enough to be a contestant on a show where i’m contractually obligated to propose to a woman who believes in a heteronormative, patriarchal idea of what a family should be. at the end of every episode, i offer roses to those i wish to make out w/more &amp; take out on prepackaged romantic dates i could never afford on my bachelor budget. for example: a date in a castle, a glass slipper prop, a clock winding its way down to midnight. my date &amp; i sip champagne, chat &amp; eat, then we dance to a live orchestra led by a maestro who wishes he were dead. a giant screen appears &amp; plays a clip of a live-action cinderella movie w/prince charming played by an actor i’ve seen slaughter &amp; behead a soldier like clipping the head off a rose. in real life, my dates consist of dinner at burger king where we dine on chicken fries &amp; don paper crowns for a royal feel. on another show date, i take two women into south dakota where we fly over the heads of white slave owners carved into a sacred native mountain. at the end of the date, i offer no roses to either woman &amp; abandon them on a canopied bed in the middle of the badlands &amp; take off in a helicopter to provide the cameras an aerial view of wilderness &amp; despair. at the end of the show, i find myself proposing to a fertility nurse in a barn made to look like a chapel &amp; not the place where i raised my first horse, fucked my first goat. here, i will milk the cows for our future offspring to drink straight from the teat like i did as a kid. the show ends &amp; i rise from the couch &amp; walk into the kitchen. on bended knee, i reach for a bottle of beer deep in the back of the fridge, pop the top like a question &amp; take a swig, cold &amp; crisp once it hits my full lips.

 for miami they all like to hang out. thinking is all rather grim to them. snake and minnie, who love each other dearly, drink in different bars, ride home in separate cars. they like to kiss good night with unexplored lips. they go out of town to see each other open. this they do for no one else. minnie does it all for god. snake does it all for fame. backstage is where they play their games; that’s why i know their business.  i was gonna talk about a race riot. they say they’ve never played that town. fleece tells me he’s seen an old movie about a black town attacking a white one. sidney poitier was the young doctor, accused, abused and enraged. there were ossie davis and woody strode, ruby dee and a hundred unknowns. also sapphire’s mama as a maid. “what was sapphire’s mama’s name?” says inez. i was going to talk about a race riot but we were stuck on kingfish’s mother-in-law. minnie kisses snake so he’ll forget about that and i say, “they’re mad, they’re on the bottom going down, stung by white justice in a white town, and then there’s other colored people, who don’t necessarily think they’re colored people, leaving them the ground.”  “that’s just like the dreads, the coptics, and the man-ley-ites,” one drunk says too loud, “i and i know,” say he. snake yells, “are you crazy? no, it ain’t, and no, we don’t.” “that’s just like angola,” terri chimes, “sometimes it’s not who but what, sometimes not what but who.”  i’m trying to talk to these people about this race riot, someone is walking on the bar, and every one of us belongs even now to miami, to people we have never seen.  pookie and omar want to know what’s goin’ on. they always do, ’cause they’re always in the bathroom when it’s goin’ on. they do everything together and not for god, and not for fame, but for love. at least that’s what their records say. they are a singing group that’s had 13 pookies.  omar asks me, “what do you want to say?” inez interupts, “she don’t know what to say, she just wants to say something, i understand that.” the 13th pookie chirps, “this race riot sounds like all the other race riots.” fleece says, “and you sound like 12 other pookies, pookie.”  i am still trying to talk about this race riot. minnie looks up and says, “we don’t have anywhere to put any more dead.” snake puts on his coat to leave alone, “we never did, we never did.”

 all summer the patio drifted in and out of light the color of margarine; days were blue, not always sky blue. at night the word algeria circulated among the grown-ups.  a patient of my father had whooping cough, the words drifted into summer blue. the evenings spun into stadium lights. kennedy’s hair blew across the screen. castro was just a sofa.  i saw james meredith’s face through a spread of leaves on the evening news. the fridge sweat with orangeade, the trees whooped some nights in rain—  a kid down the street kept coughing into his mitt. static sounds from comiskey and fenway came though the vinyl, the plastic, the pillow—  so when it left stallard’s hand, when roger maris’s arms whipped the bat and the bullet-arc carried into the chasm the disaffections at 344 ft. near the bullpen fence  under the green girder holding up the voices rising into the façade and over the river where a baptist choir on lenox ave. was sending up a variation of sweet chariot into the traffic on the fdr that was jammed at the triboro  where a derrick was broken and the cables of its arms picked up the star-blast of voices coming over the stadium façade spilling down the black next-game sign into the vector of a tilted coke bottle on a billboard  at the edge of the river where a cloud of pigeons rose over roosevelt island. it was evening by the time the cars unjammed and the green of the outfield unfroze and the white arc had faded into skyline before fall came  full of boys throwing themselves onto the turf with inexplicable desire for the thing promised. the going. then gone.

 ye sons of great britain, come join with me, and sing in praise of sir garnet wolseley; sound drums and trumpets cheerfully, for he has acted most heroically.  therefore loudly his praises sing until the hills their echoes back doth ring; for he is a noble hero bold, and an honour to his queen and country, be it told.  he has gained for himself fame and renown, which to posterity will be handed down; because he has defeated arabi by land and by sea, and from the battle of tel-el-kebir he made him to flee.  with an army about fourteen thousand strong, through egypt he did fearlessly march along, with the gallant and brave highland brigade, to whom honour is due, be it said.  arabi’s army was about seventy thousand in all, and, virtually speaking, it wasn’t very small; but if they had been as numerous again, the irish and highland brigades would have beaten them, it is plain.  ’twas on the 13th day of september, in the year of 1882, which arabi and his rebel horde long will rue; because sir garnet wolseley and his brave little band fought and conquered them on kebir land.  he marched upon the enemy with his gallant band o’er the wild and lonely desert sand, and attacked them before daylight, and in twenty minutes he put them to flight.  the first shock of the attack was borne by the second brigade, who behaved most manfully, it is said, under the command of brave general grahame, and have gained a lasting honour to their name.  but major hart and the 18th royal irish, conjoint, carried the trenches at the bayonet point; then the marines chased them about four miles away, at the charge of the bayonet, without dismay!  general sir archibald alison led on the highland brigade, who never were the least afraid. and such has been the case in this egyptian war, for at the charge of the bayonet they ran from them afar!  with their bagpipes playing, and one ringing cheer, and the 42nd soon did the trenches clear; then hand to hand they did engage, and fought like tigers in a cage.  oh! it must have been a glorious sight to see sir garnet wolseley in the thickest of the fight! in the midst of shot and shell, and the cannon’s roar, whilst the dead and the dying lay weltering in their gore.  then the egyptians were forced to yield, and the british were left masters of the field; then arabi he did fret and frown to see his army thus cut down.  then arabi the rebel took to flight, and spurred his arab steed with all his might: with his heart full of despair and woe, and never halted till he reached cairo.  now since the egyptian war is at an end, let us thank god! who did send sir garnet wolseley to crush and kill arabi and his rebel army at kebir hill.

 back when i used to be indian i am standing outside the pool hall with my sister. she strawberry blonde. stale sweat and beer through the open door. a warrior leans on his stick, fingers blue with chalk. another bends to shoot. his braids brush the green felt, swinging to the beat of the jukebox. we move away. hank williams falls again in the backseat of a cadillac. i look back. a wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt, brings the scent of wounded horses.

 (may 22, 1965) when we look at ourselves we see ourselves through eyes which have been schooled to see comely only the opaque, comely to us skin that is fair, comely to us eyes that are light, comely to us hair that is straight, comely to us lips that are thin, our gods and goddesses glow in opalescent whiteness and daily we worship at this shrine. ugly to us our satin black skin, ugly to us our fulsome lips, ugly to us our midnight eyes, ugly to us our crisping hair thus we have rejected our image. but this is not as it should be we black people must be born again. know that the black people like other races have their own distinct beauty, know that the stygian night too is beautiful.

 for arnold rampersad   shadows bluing the snow, the pines’ and mine, bear the cast of a kestrel’s blue-gray crown i note as i find my way about this town.  blues here more likely the nordic-eyes kind than the blue-black of some black folk back home. here so many lakes reflect the sky’s blue dome;  some summer days skimmed-milk blue tints windblown whitecaps. blue’s an adjective, verb, and noun, and the color of the world when i pine  because she’s gone leaving too much wine and time. blue shadows on the snow, mine and the pines’. for a tall man, blue ox, and now me, home  is bemidji, though the blues here around more the cast of a kestrel’s blue-gray crown than the blue-black of my cousins back home.

 he promises a canary dress, white gloves, says they’ll eat chops, thick as her thighs, that they’ll order doubles of the “finest,” see all the big names when they arrive. but it’s the thought of them dead: half of what they own draped around them, her head against his chest, his back slack against the headboard, all their letters unopened, bills not paid, long knocks, the notices tacked outside their door. it’s not knowing whether some smell would introduce them to their neighbors or a landlord wheeling them out into the hallway; the highboy he chipped on the drive up, the silver she inherited from her mother, her hatboxes, stacked high next to them like a wedding cake waiting to be buried. he heard that “up there” the wind had talons sharp enough to hook a grown man beneath his collarbone and carry him a full city block. he heard that you learned the months by measuring the length of their shadows and even summer was like a quality of night.

 the birth isn’t about poetry it is about screaming pain on a sunday hailing a cab and head racing to the hospital, now so close to the new apartment  i had a baby inside of me but no one expected it to happen so fast or then at least they said they didn’t maybe they expected it to happen so fast all along  alone in the waiting room i shook and shook and the blood ran down my legs later with the magnesium i thought of the many permutations of the bald head pale, pickling fish skin, glowing with scales  when she came out, she was dark and full of hair no blood, but born in the caul like the other magical realities of my past accomplishments when she came out she cried and it sounded like me but passed me, into her new reality  now 3 weeks later, they say i am still not an erotic object so i wander the park in the snow with my friend we light candles and pray to the darkness we light the park on fire and the police come and find us  when they take us to the jail, i say no, it’s not right i am a mother after all they say, but where is your baby and i say, no no, my baby my baby they say, yes yes, look at your beautiful baby  i say, i do, i do look, look, and listen my baby my baby she’s here

 prairie winds blaze through her tumbled belly, and emmett’s red yesterdays refuse to rename her any kind of mother. a pudge-cheeked otherwise, sugar whistler, her boy is (through the fierce clenching mouth of her memory) a grays-and-shadows child.listen. once she was pretty. windy hues goldened her skin. she was pert, brown-faced, in every wide way the opposite of the raw, screeching thing chaos has crafted. now, threaded awkwardly, she tires of the sorries, the lawd have mercies. grief’s damnable tint is everywhere, darkening days she is no longer aware of. she is gospel revolving, repeatedly emptied of light, pulled and caressed, cooed upon by strangers, offered pork and taffy. boys in the street stare at her, then avert their eyes, as if she killed them all, shipped every one into the grips of delta. she sits, her chair carefully balanced on hell’s edge, and pays for sanity in kisses upon the conjured forehead of her son. beginning with a, she recites (angry, away, awful) the alphabet of a world gone red. coffee scorches her throat as church ladies drift about her room, black garb sweating their hips, filling cups with tap water, drinking, drinking in glimpses of her steep undoing. the absence of a black roomful of boy is measured, again, again. in the clutches of coffee, red-eyed, mamie knows their well-meaning murmur. one says she a mama, still. once you have a chile, you always a mama.

 son of man. son of marvin &amp; tallulah. son of flatbush &amp; roti &amp; dollar vans bolting down the avenue after six. the boy grew like a debt, &amp; beautified every meter of the pockmarked, jet black asphalt which held him aloft on days he sped from much larger men along its skin. godfathers &amp; hustlers, division 1 scholarship forfeiters, alchemists, liars, lasagna connoisseurs, internet mixtape djs &amp; baby mama conflict consultants, each one appearing as if from the smoke of our  collective imagination, jordans laced, drawstrings taut, all of them gathered one by one to race the gangly, mop-top prodigy from the front of superior market to the block’s endarkened terminus, the same corner where man man got jumped so bad at the back end of last summer, neighborhood residents came to regard the place as a kind of memorial &amp; it was like this every other afternoon, you know, from june through the final days leading up to the book drives &amp; raucous cookouts which signaled our school year’s inauspicious return, this was the manner by which mycah dudley first gained his fame, dusting grown men without so much as the faintest scintillation of sweat to make the performance ethical. it was damn near unsportsmanlike, his effortlessness, mass cruelty in a new york city dreamscape, the laughter of girls with hip-length, straight-back braids &amp; baby powder forces making every contest an event worth leaving the perch of your bunk bed, stepping out into the record-breaking swelter that summer held like a trap door for kids with broken box fans &amp; no mother home for at least four more hours to fill the quiet with discipline.  •  we gathered in swarms to gawk at our boy before takeoff. his flesh maroon-clad from head to foot like an homage to blood, black plastic afro pick with a fist for a handle jutting from the left side of his high-top fade, his high-top chuck taylors, size 12, sounding like ox hooves once he entered the groove of a good run &amp; the distinction was basically moot at that point is what i am saying, the line between him &amp; any other mystical creature, any worthwhile myth, any god of prey or waning life.  •  the entire block was out that night. firecrackers packed the blackening air, their fury matched only by the exorbitance of dope-boy  convertibles turned mobile dancehalls by the moment’s weight. which might explain why no one quite remembers when, or how, the now-infamous brawl began. only that mycah was in rare form earlier that evening, having just embarrassed mars patterson — so named, it bears mentioning, for the chocolate bars he loved to steal &amp; trade on the 4 train, not the red rock planet or lord of war — but was now in his everyday mode, seated on the stoop, a seer with so few words for devotees &amp; passersby, each eventually stopped asking for his backstory,  for his praise or functional wisdom, &amp; instead were content to let him eat his veggie patty with cheese without interruption, which he did, which he was, when the din that always accompanies someone’s son’s public pummeling rang out, cut through our scene lengthwise, compelled the boy, for the first time on record, to leap from the steps of the brownstone his nana died braiding hair inside of, enter the scrum, thresh the crowd for signs of the conflict’s center.  •  general consensus has it he was looking for his little cousin, &amp; found him, even before the initial cop car ran like a living ram through the people. before the boys in blue sprang, a spray of navy fléchettes, from behind its doors. before they were caught in the scuffle, released ten to twenty rounds of ammo into the crowd without warning, bullets glancing off of cutlass doors &amp; corner store glass built for battle, all but three or four of which entered the boy mid-stride, lifted his six-foot frame from the ground, legs still pumping. for a second, you would almost swear he was running through the gunfire, preparing for liftoff or something, baby cousin held firmly in his arms, shielded from the onslaught.they never would have caught him if he hadn’t been holding that child, said no one, though we all thought it during the weeks following that moment we each froze, the moment his body collapsed slow as petals upon the unremarkable cement, &amp; we stared at our champion felled by an outcome so common we don’t even have a special name for it. still. no one standing ran that day. most of us turned to face his killers, hands at our sides, determined to make them make it a massacre. but all that was before we heard man man let off a scream so full it rent the crowd in two, split the circle we had built around the boy’s corpse, our human wall parting to watch each casing fall from mycah’s still-wet, dark red sweatshirt onto the street. hear me. i heard the gunman’s greeting. saw hollow points etch  apertures into the boy’s clothes. they shot mycah dudley, quite  legally. he died that night. he rose.

 i tried one or two but they were stale and broke like sticks or crumbled when i rolled them and lighting a match was useless nor could i put them back in the refrigerator— it was too late for that—even licking them filled my mouth with ground-up outer leaf, product of lancaster or eastern virginia, so schooled i am with cigars, it comes in the blood, and i threw handfuls of them into the street from three floors up and, to my horror, sitting on my stoop were four or five street people who ran to catch them as if they were suddenly rich, and i apologize for that, no one should be degraded that way, my hands were crazy, and i ran down to explain but they were smoking already nor did i have anything to give them since we were living on beans ourselves, i sat and smoked too, and once in a while we looked up at the open window, and one of us spit into his empty can. we were visionaries.

NEW POEM
 his father told him never start writing or reading in the middle of a book.  there’s a title, don’t go on without one. and he didn’t go on without one — he had the title private.  this was life’s taproot — the obedient boy began always at the beginning.  books start out with what the boy calls beauty — the boat’s still in port. the cat’s alive. pantry’s packed.  even present tense has some of the grace of past tense, what with all the present tense left to go.  usually, by the first page or second, a relationship emerges between text and title.  some of the words blur on the page and the key ones glow,  as does the title, and a fat red arrow with two heads connects them. yum.  it was like owning something. the way when he paid for a fine hat and put it on,  he felt a circuit through the rim and top and sides, swilling gray hat blood.  and he felt like his heart controlled this circuit remotely, via microchip.  if a book could not service him with this truth, which was all the pleasure in the world,  he would usually stop reading. he saw the end of very few books anyway —  who needs two climaxes? after that intense sensation the book always changed. it was like looking  at a plate of food he’d half-eaten and had rendered him bloated and nauseous.  now he is on marches. now his gun makes a nest in his arm crook  with nasty red welts for straw. now his rear leaks smelly water all day.  his whole life he has balanced himself on an absurdly slender proscenium  and as he continues to edge out he can’t tell if it isn’t maybe a gangplank.  he doesn’t like the switch-up. what’s out there? he wonders, in what he’ll call ocean for now.  to his right is an alligator. but the head-ridge has no bone. it’s propped up instead by fumes: rich, dark, and pungent.  far off, men are cradling cracked dolphins. arrows of fire shoot out the blowholes. the wounds bleed silver.  perhaps they are connecting to a title in the sky. but he’s not seeing any of these things.  the world is mostly brown and black, and smells like a rotting fridge.  what is it? what is it? is it a hand? is it an eye? is it a hat? it is time.

 just as in the horror movies when someone discovers that the phone calls are coming from inside the house  so too, i realized that our tender overlapping has been taking place only inside me.  all that sweetness, the love and desire— it’s just been me dialing myself then following the ringing to another room  to find no one on the line, well, sometimes a little breathing but more often than not, nothing.  to think that all this time— which would include the boat rides, the airport embraces, and all the drinks—  it’s been only me and the two telephones, the one on the wall in the kitchen and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs.

 for burn construction company when you were building the i -10 bypass, one of   your dozers, moving earth at the center of a great pit, slipped its thick blade beneath the water table, slicing into the earth’s wet palm, and the silt moistened beneath the huge thing’s tires, and the crew was sent home for the day. next morning, water filled the pit. nothing anyone could do to stop it coming. it was a revelation: kidney-shaped, deep green, there between the interstate and the sewage treatment plant. when nothing else worked, you called it a lake and opened it to the public. and we were the public.

 a free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky.  but a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing.  the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom.  the free bird thinks of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn and he names the sky his own  but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing.  the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom.

 "thou thoughtest that i was altogether such a one as thyself." (david, psalms 50.21) ['will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best, flat on his belly in the pit's much mire, with elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin. and, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush, and feels about his spine small eft-things course, run in and out each arm, and make him laugh: and while above his head a pompion-plant, coating the cave-top as a brow its eye, creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard, and now a flower drops with a bee inside, and now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,— he looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross and recross till they weave a spider-web (meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at times) and talks to his own self, howe'er he please, touching that other, whom his dam called god. because to talk about him, vexes—ha, could he but know! and time to vex is now, when talk is safer than in winter-time. moreover prosper and miranda sleep in confidence he drudges at their task, and it is good to cheat the pair, and gibe, letting the rank tongue blossom into speech.]  setebos, setebos, and setebos! 'thinketh, he dwelleth i' the cold o' the moon.  'thinketh he made it, with the sun to match, but not the stars; the stars came otherwise; only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that: also this isle, what lives and grows thereon, and snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.  'thinketh, it came of being ill at ease: he hated that he cannot change his cold, nor cure its ache. 'hath spied an icy fish that longed to 'scape the rock-stream where she lived, and thaw herself within the lukewarm brine o' the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid, a crystal spike 'twixt two warm walls of wave; only, she ever sickened, found repulse at the other kind of water, not her life, (green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o' the sun) flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe, and in her old bounds buried her despair, hating and loving warmth alike: so he.  'thinketh, he made thereat the sun, this isle, trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing. yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech; yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam, that floats and feeds; a certain badger brown he hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye by moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue that pricks deep into oak warts for a worm, and says a plain word when she finds her prize, but will not eat the ants; the ants themselves that build a wall of seeds and settled stalks about their hole—he made all these and more, made all we see, and us, in spite: how else? he could not, himself, make a second self to be his mate; as well have made himself: he would not make what he mislikes or slights, an eyesore to him, or not worth his pains: but did, in envy, listlessness or sport, make what himself would fain, in a manner, be— weaker in most points, stronger in a few, worthy, and yet mere playthings all the while, things he admires and mocks too,—that is it. because, so brave, so better though they be, it nothing skills if he begin to plague. look, now, i melt a gourd-fruit into mash, add honeycomb and pods, i have perceived, which bite like finches when they bill and kiss,— then, when froth rises bladdery, drink up all, quick, quick, till maggots scamper through my brain; last, throw me on my back i' the seeded thyme, and wanton, wishing i were born a bird. put case, unable to be what i wish, i yet could make a live bird out of clay: would not i take clay, pinch my caliban able to fly?—for, there, see, he hath wings, and great comb like the hoopoe's to admire, and there, a sting to do his foes offence, there, and i will that he begin to live, fly to yon rock-top, nip me off the horns of grigs high up that make the merry din, saucy through their veined wings, and mind me not. in which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay, and he lay stupid-like,—why, i should laugh; and if he, spying me, should fall to weep, beseech me to be good, repair his wrong, bid his poor leg smart less or grow again,— well, as the chance were, this might take or else not take my fancy: i might hear his cry, and give the mankin three sound legs for one, or pluck the other off, leave him like an egg and lessoned he was mine and merely clay. were this no pleasure, lying in the thyme, drinking the mash, with brain become alive, making and marring clay at will? so he.  'thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in him, nor kind, nor cruel: he is strong and lord. 'am strong myself compared to yonder crabs that march now from the mountain to the sea; 'let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first, loving not, hating not, just choosing so. 'say, the first straggler that boasts purple spots shall join the file, one pincer twisted off; 'say, this bruised fellow shall receive a worm, and two worms he whose nippers end in red; as it likes me each time, i do: so he.  well then, 'supposeth he is good i' the main, placable if his mind and ways were guessed, but rougher than his handiwork, be sure! oh, he hath made things worthier than himself, and envieth that, so helped, such things do more than he who made them! what consoles but this? that they, unless through him, do nought at all, and must submit: what other use in things? 'hath cut a pipe of pithless elder-joint that, blown through, gives exact the scream o' the jay when from her wing you twitch the feathers blue: sound this, and little birds that hate the jay flock within stone's throw, glad their foe is hurt: put case such pipe could prattle and boast forsooth "i catch the birds, i am the crafty thing, i make the cry my maker cannot make with his great round mouth; he must blow through mine!' would not i smash it with my foot? so he.  but wherefore rough, why cold and ill at ease? aha, that is a question! ask, for that, what knows,—the something over setebos that made him, or he, may be, found and fought, worsted, drove off and did to nothing, perchance. there may be something quiet o'er his head, out of his reach, that feels nor joy nor grief, since both derive from weakness in some way. i joy because the quails come; would not joy could i bring quails here when i have a mind: this quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth. 'esteemeth stars the outposts of its couch, but never spends much thought nor care that way. it may look up, work up,—the worse for those it works on! 'careth but for setebos the many-handed as a cuttle-fish, who, making himself feared through what he does, looks up, first, and perceives he cannot soar to what is quiet and hath happy life; next looks down here, and out of very spite makes this a bauble-world to ape yon real, these good things to match those as hips do grapes. 'tis solace making baubles, ay, and sport. himself peeped late, eyed prosper at his books careless and lofty, lord now of the isle: vexed, 'stitched a book of broad leaves, arrow-shaped, wrote thereon, he knows what, prodigious words; has peeled a wand and called it by a name; weareth at whiles for an enchanter's robe the eyed skin of a supple oncelot; and hath an ounce sleeker than youngling mole, a four-legged serpent he makes cower and couch, now snarl, now hold its breath and mind his eye, and saith she is miranda and my wife: 'keeps for his ariel a tall pouch-bill crane he bids go wade for fish and straight disgorge; also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he snared, blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat tame, and split its toe-webs, and now pens the drudge in a hole o' the rock and calls him caliban; a bitter heart that bides its time and bites. 'plays thus at being prosper in a way, taketh his mirth with make-believes: so he. his dam held that the quiet made all things which setebos vexed only: 'holds not so. who made them weak, meant weakness he might vex. had he meant other, while his hand was in, why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick, or plate my scalp with bone against the snow, or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint like an orc's armour? ay,—so spoil his sport! he is the one now: only he doth all.  'saith, he may like, perchance, what profits him. ay, himself loves what does him good; but why? 'gets good no otherwise. this blinded beast loves whoso places flesh-meat on his nose, but, had he eyes, would want no help, but hate or love, just as it liked him: he hath eyes. also it pleaseth setebos to work, use all his hands, and exercise much craft, by no means for the love of what is worked. 'tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the world when all goes right, in this safe summer-time, and he wants little, hungers, aches not much, than trying what to do with wit and strength. 'falls to make something: 'piled yon pile of turfs, and squared and stuck there squares of soft white chalk, and, with a fish-tooth, scratched a moon on each, and set up endwise certain spikes of tree, and crowned the whole with a sloth's skull a-top, found dead i' the woods, too hard for one to kill. no use at all i' the work, for work's sole sake; 'shall some day knock it down again: so he.  'saith he is terrible: watch his feats in proof! one hurricane will spoil six good months' hope. he hath a spite against me, that i know, just as he favours prosper, who knows why? so it is, all the same, as well i find. 'wove wattles half the winter, fenced them firm with stone and stake to stop she-tortoises crawling to lay their eggs here: well, one wave, feeling the foot of him upon its neck, gaped as a snake does, lolled out its large tongue, and licked the whole labour flat: so much for spite. 'saw a ball flame down late (yonder it lies) where, half an hour before, i slept i' the shade: often they scatter sparkles: there is force! 'dug up a newt he may have envied once and turned to stone, shut up inside a stone. please him and hinder this?—what prosper does? aha, if he would tell me how! not he! there is the sport: discover how or die! all need not die, for of the things o' the isle some flee afar, some dive, some run up trees; those at his mercy,—why, they please him most when . . . when . . . well, never try the same way twice! repeat what act has pleased, he may grow wroth. you must not know his ways, and play him off, sure of the issue. 'doth the like himself: 'spareth a squirrel that it nothing fears but steals the nut from underneath my thumb, and when i threat, bites stoutly in defence: 'spareth an urchin that contrariwise, curls up into a ball, pretending death for fright at my approach: the two ways please. but what would move my choler more than this, that either creature counted on its life to-morrow and next day and all days to come, saying, forsooth, in the inmost of its heart, "because he did so yesterday with me, and otherwise with such another brute, so must he do henceforth and always."—ay? would teach the reasoning couple what "must" means! 'doth as he likes, or wherefore lord? so he.  'conceiveth all things will continue thus, and we shall have to live in fear of him so long as he lives, keeps his strength: no change, if he have done his best, make no new world to please him more, so leave off watching this,— if he surprise not even the quiet's self some strange day,—or, suppose, grow into it as grubs grow butterflies: else, here are we, and there is he, and nowhere help at all.  'believeth with the life, the pain shall stop. his dam held different, that after death he both plagued enemies and feasted friends: idly! he doth his worst in this our life, giving just respite lest we die through pain, saving last pain for worst,—with which, an end. meanwhile, the best way to escape his ire is, not to seem too happy. 'sees, himself, yonder two flies, with purple films and pink, bask on the pompion-bell above: kills both. 'sees two black painful beetles roll their ball on head and tail as if to save their lives: moves them the stick away they strive to clear.  even so, 'would have him misconceive, suppose this caliban strives hard and ails no less, and always, above all else, envies him; wherefore he mainly dances on dark nights, moans in the sun, gets under holes to laugh, and never speaks his mind save housed as now: outside, 'groans, curses. if he caught me here, o'erheard this speech, and asked "what chucklest at?" 'would, to appease him, cut a finger off, or of my three kid yearlings burn the best, or let the toothsome apples rot on tree, or push my tame beast for the orc to taste: while myself lit a fire, and made a song and sung it, " what i hate, be consecrate  to celebrate thee and thy state, no mate  for thee; what see for envy in poor me? " hoping the while, since evils sometimes mend, warts rub away and sores are cured with slime, that some strange day, will either the quiet catch and conquer setebos, or likelier he decrepit may doze, doze, as good as die.  [what, what? a curtain o'er the world at once! crickets stop hissing: not a bird—or, yes, there scuds his raven that has told him all! it was fool's play, this prattling! ha! the wind shoulders the pillared dust, death's house o' the move, and fast invading fires begin! white blaze— a tree's head snaps—and there, there, there, there, there, his thunder follows! fool to gibe at him! lo! 'lieth flat and loveth setebos! 'maketh his teeth meet through his upper lip, will let those quails fly, will not eat this month one little mess of whelks, so he may 'scape!]

and at a knyght than wol i first bigynn e .  a knyght ther was, and that a worthy man, that fro the tym e that he first bigan to riden out, he lov e d chivalri e , trouthe and honóur, fredom and curteisi e . ful worthy was he in his lord e s werr e , and thereto hadde he riden, no man ferr e , as wel in cristendom as in heth e ness e , and evere honóur e d for his worthyness e . at alisaundre he was whan it was wonn e ; ful oft e tyme he hadde the bord bigonn e  aboven all e nac i ons in pruc e . in lettow hadde he reys e d and in ruc e ,— no cristen man so ofte of his degree. in gernade at the seege eek hadde he be of algezir, and riden in belmary e . at lyeys was he, and at sataly e , whan they were wonne; and in the gret e see at many a noble armee hadde he be.  at mortal batailles hadde he been fiften e , and foughten for oure feith at tramyssen e  in lyst e thri e s, and ay slayn his foo. this ilk e worthy knyght hadde been also somtym e with the lord of palaty e  agayn another hethen in turky e ; and evermoore he hadde a sovereyn prys. and though that he were worthy, he was wys, and of his port as meeke as is a mayd e . he nevere yet no vileynye ne sayd e , in al his lyf, unto no maner wight. he was a verray, parfit, gentil knyght.  but for to tellen yow of his array, his hors weren good e , but he was nat gay; of fustian he wer e d a gypon al bismóter e d with his habergeon; for he was late y-come from his viag e , and went e for to doon his pilgrymag e .  with hym ther was his sone, a yong squiér, a lovyere and a lusty bacheler, with lokk e s crulle as they were leyd in press e . of twenty yeer of age he was, i gess e . of his statúre he was of evene length e , and wonderly delyvere and of greet strength e . and he hadde been somtyme in chyvachi e  in flaundr e s, in artoys, and pycardi e , and born hym weel, as of so litel spac e , in hope to stonden in his lady grac e . embrouded was he, as it were a meed e  al ful of fressh e flour e s whyte and reed e . syngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day; he was as fressh as is the month of may. short was his gowne, with slev e s longe and wyd e ; wel koude he sitte on hors and fair e ryd e ; he koud e song e s make and wel endit e , juste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and writ e . so hoote he lov e de that by nyghtertal e  he sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngal e . curteis he was, lowely and servysábl e , and carf biforn his fader at the tabl e .  a yeman hadde he and servántz namo at that tyme, for hym list e rid e soo; and he was clad in cote and hood of gren e . a sheef of pecock arw e s bright and ken e , under his belt he bar ful thriftily— wel koude he dresse his takel yemanly; his arw e s droup e d noght with fether e s low e — and in his hand he baar a myghty bow e . a not-heed hadde he, with a broun viság e . of wood e craft wel koude he al the uság e . upon his arm he baar a gay bracér, and by his syde a swerd and a bokeler, and on that oother syde a gay dagger e , harneis e d wel and sharp as point of sper e ; a cristophere on his brest of silver sheen e . an horn he bar, the bawdryk was of gren e . a forster was he, soothly as i gess e .  ther was also a nonne, a prioress e , that of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy; hire gretteste ooth was but by seint e loy, and she was clep e d madame eglentyn e . ful weel she soong the servic e dyvyn e , entun e d in hir nose ful sem e ly; and frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly, after the scole of stratford att e bow e , for frenssh of parys was to hire unknow e . at met e wel y-taught was she with-all e : she leet no morsel from hir lipp e s fall e , ne wette hir fyngr e s in hir sauc e dep e . wel koude she carie a morsel and wel kep e  thát no drope ne fille upon hire brist; in curteisie was set ful muchel hir list. hire over-lipp e wyp e d she so clen e  that in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sen e  of grec e , whan she dronken hadde hir draught e . ful sem e ly after hir mete she raught e . and sikerly she was of greet desport, and ful plesáunt and amyable of port, and peyn e d hire to countrefet e cheer e  of court, and been estatlich of maner e , and to ben holden digne of reverenc e . but for to speken of hire consc i enc e , she was so charitable and so pitous she wold e wepe if that she saugh a mous kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledd e . of smal e hound e s hadde she, that she fedd e  with rosted flessh, or milk and wastel breed; but soor e wepte she if oon of hem were deed, or if men smoot it with a yerd e smert e ; and al was consc i ence and tendr e hert e .  ful semyly hir wympul pynch e d was; hire nose tretys, her eyen greye as glas, hir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed; but sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; it was almoost a spann e brood, i trow e ; for, hardily, she was nat undergrow e . ful fetys was hir cloke, as i was war; of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar a peire of bed e s, gauded al with gren e , and ther-on heng a brooch of gold ful sheen e , on which ther was first write a crown e d a, and after,amor vincit omnia.  another nonn e with hire hadd e she, that was hire chap e leyne, and preest e s thre.  a monk ther was, a fair for the maistri e , an outridere, that lov e de veneri e ; a manly man, to been an abbot abl e . ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stabl e ; and whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heer e  gýnglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleer e , and eek as loude, as dooth the chapel bell e , ther as this lord was kepere of the cell e . the reule of seint maure or of seint beneit, by-cause that it was old and som-del streit,— this ilk e monk leet old e thyng e s pac e , and heeld after the new e world the spac e . he yaf nat of that text a pull e d hen that seith that hunters ben nat hooly men, ne that a monk, whan he is recch e lees, is likn e d til a fissh that is waterlees,— this is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystr e . but thilk e text heeld he nat worth an oystr e ; and i seyde his opinioun was good. what sholde he studie and make hymselven wood, upon a book in cloystre alwey to pour e , or swynken with his hand e s and labóur e , as austyn bit? how shal the world be serv e d? lat austyn have his swynk to him reserv e d. therfore he was a prikasour aright: grehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowel in flight; of prikyng and of huntyng for the har e  was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spar e . i seigh his sleves y-púrfiled at the hond with grys, and that the fyneste of a lond; and for to festne his hood under his chyn he hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pyn; a love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was. his heed was balled, that shoon as any glas, and eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt. he was a lord ful fat and in good poynt; his eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed, that stem e d as a forneys of a leed; his boot e s souple, his hors in greet estaat. now certeinly he was a fair prelaat. he was nat pale, as a forpyn e d goost: a fat swan loved he best of any roost. his palfrey was as broun as is a bery e .  a frere ther was, a wantowne and a mery e , a lymytour, a ful solémpn e man. in all e the ordr e s foure is noon that kan so muchel of daliaunce and fair langag e . he hadd e maad ful many a mar i ag e  of yong e wommen at his owen e cost. unto his ordre he was a nobl e post. ful wel biloved and famulier was he with frankeleyns over al in his contree, and eek with worthy wommen of the toun; for he hadde power of confess i oun, as seyde hym-self, moor e than a curát, for of his ordre he was licenciat. ful swet e ly herde he confess i oun, and plesaunt was his absoluc i oun. he was an esy man to yeve penaunc e  there as he wiste to have a good pitaunc e ; for unto a povre ordr e for to yiv e  is sign e that a man is wel y-shryv e ; for, if he yaf, he dorst e make avaunt he wiste that a man was répentaunt; for many a man so hard is of his hert e  he may nat wepe al-thogh hym soor e smert e . therfore in stede of wepynge and preyér e s men moote yeve silver to the povr e frer e s. his typet was ay fars e d full of knyv e s and pynn e s, for to yeven fair e wyv e s. and certeinly he hadde a murye not e : wel koude he synge and pleyen on a rot e ; of yeddynges he baar outr e ly the pris. his nekk e whit was as the flour-de-lys; ther-to he strong was as a champioun. he knew the tavernes wel in every toun, and everich hostiler and tappester e  bet than a lazar or a beggester e ; for unto swich a worthy man as he acorded nat, as by his facultee, to have with sik e lazars aqueyntaunc e ; it is nat honest, it may nat avaunc e  fór to deelen with no swich poraill e , but al with riche and selleres of vitaill e . and over-al, ther as profit sholde aris e , curteis he was and lowely of servys e . ther nas no man nowher so vertuous. he was the best e beggere in his hous; [and yaf a certeyn ferm e for the graunt, noon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt;] for thogh a wydw e hadd e noght a sho, so plesaunt was his in principio, yet wolde he have a ferthyng er he went e : his purchas was wel bettr e than his rent e . and rage he koude, as it were right a whelp e . in lov e -dayes ther koude he muchel help e , for there he was nat lyk a cloysterer with a thredbare cope, as is a povre scolér, but he was lyk a maister, or a pop e ; of doubl e worstede was his semycop e , that rounded as a belle, out of the press e . somwhat he lips e d for his wantowness e , to make his englissh sweete upon his tong e ; and in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe, his eyen twynkl e d in his heed aryght as doon the sterr e s in the frosty nyght. this worthy lymytour was cleped hubérd.  a marchant was ther with a fork e d berd, in mott e leye, and hye on horse he sat; upon his heed a flaundryssh bevere hat; his boot e s clasp e d faire and fetisly. his resons he spak ful solémpn e ly, sownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng. he wolde the see were kept for any thing bitwix e middelburgh and or e well e . wel koude he in eschaung e sheeld e s sell e . this worthy man ful wel his wit bisett e ; ther wist e no wight that he was in dett e , so estatly was he of his gouvernaunc e , with his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunc e . for sothe he was a worthy man with-all e , but, sooth to seyn, i noot how men hym call e .  a clerk ther was of oxenford also, that unto logyk hadd e longe y-go. as leen e was his hors as is a rak e , and he nas nat right fat, i undertak e , but look e d holwe, and ther-to sobr e ly. ful thredbare was his overeste court e py; for he hadde geten hym yet no benefic e , ne was so worldly for to have offic e ; for hym was lévere háve at his bedd e s heed twénty book e s, clad in blak or reed, of aristotle and his philosophi e , than rob e s riche, or fíthele, or gay sautri e . but al be that he was a philosophr e , yet hadd e he but litel gold in cofr e ; but al that he myghte of his freend e s hent e  on book e s and on lernynge he it spent e , and bisily gan for the soul e s prey e  of hem that yaf hym wher-with to scoley e . of studie took he moost cure and moost heed e . noght o word spak he moor e than was need e ; and that was seyd in forme and reverenc e , and short and quyk and ful of hy senténc e . sownynge in moral vertu was his spech e ; and gladly wolde he lerne and gladly tech e .  a sergeant of the law e , war and wys, that often hadd e been at the parvys, ther was also, ful riche of excellenc e . discreet he was, and of greet reverenc e — he sem e d swich, his word e s weren so wis e . justice he was ful often in assis e , by patente, and by pleyn commiss i oun. for his science and for his heigh renoun, of fees and rob e s hadde he many oon. so greet a purchasour was nowher noon: al was fee symple to hym in effect; his purchasyng myght e nat been infect. nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas, and yet he sem e d bisier than he was. in term e s hadde he caas and doom e s all e  that from the tyme of kyng william were fall e . ther-to he koude endite and make a thyng, ther koud e no wight pynche at his writyng; and every statut koude he pleyn by rot e . he rood but hoomly in a medlee cot e , girt with a ceint of silk, with barr e s smal e ; of his array telle i no lenger tal e .  a frank e leyn was in his compaigny e . whit was his berd as is the day e sy e ; of his complex i oun he was sangwyn. wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn; to lyven in delit was evere his won e , for he was epicurus owen e son e , that heeld opin i oun that pleyn delit was verraily felicitee parfit. an housholdere, and that a greet, was he; seint julian he was in his contree. his breed, his ale, was alweys after oon; a bettre envyn e d man was nowher noon. without e bak e mete was nevere his hous, of fissh and flessh, and that so plent e vous, it snew e d in his hous of mete and drynk e , of all e deyntees that men koud e thynk e , after the sondry sesons of the yeer; so chaung e d he his mete and his soper. ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muw e , and many a breem and many a luce in stuw e . wo was his cook but if his sauc e wer e  poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geer e . his table dormant in his halle alway stood redy cover e d al the long e day. at sessiouns ther was he lord and sir e ; ful oft e tyme he was knyght of the shir e . an anlaas, and a gipser al of silk, heeng at his girdel, whit as morn e milk. a shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; was nowher such a worthy vavasour.  an haberdasshere, and a carpenter, a webbe, a dyere, and a tapycer,— and they were cloth e d alle in o lyveree of a solémpne and a greet fraternitee. ful fressh and newe hir geere apik e d was;

for blankmanger, that made he with the best e .  a shipman was ther, wonynge fer by west e ; for aught i woot he was of dert e mouthe. he rood upon a rouncy, as he kouth e , in a gowne of faldyng to the knee. a daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun. the hoot e somer hadde maad his hewe al broun; and certeinly he was a good felaw e . ful many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-draw e  fro burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep. of nyc e consc i ence took he no keep. if that he faught and hadde the hyer hond, by water he sente hem hoom to every lond. but of his craft to rekene wel his tyd e s, his strem e s, and his daungers hym bisid e s, his herberwe and his moone, his lode-menag e , ther nas noon swich from hull e to cartag e . hardy he was and wys to undertak e ; with many a tempest hadde his berd been shak e . he knew all e the haven e s, as they wer e , from gootlond to the cape of fynyster e , and every cryke in britaigne and in spayn e . his barge y-clep e d was the maud e layn e .  with us ther was a doctour of phisik; in all this world ne was ther noon hym lik, to speke of phisik and of surgery e ; for he was grounded in astronomy e . he kepte his pac i ent a ful greet deel in hour e s, by his magyk natureel. wel koude he fortunen the ascendent of his ymáges for his pac i ent. he knew the cause of everich malady e , were it of hoot, or cold, or moyste, or dry e , and where they engendred and of what humour. he was a verray, parfit praktisour;

but riche he was of hooly thoght and werk. he was also a lern e d man, a clerk, that crist e s gospel trew e ly wolde prech e ; his parisshens devoutly wolde he tech e . benygne he was, and wonder diligent, and in adversitee ful pac i ent;

and this figure he added eek therto, that if gold rust e , what shal iren doo? for if a preest be foul, on whom we trust e , no wonder is a lew e d man to rust e ; and shame it is, if a prest tak e keep, a shiten shepherde and a clen e sheep. wel oghte a preest ensampl e for to yiv e  by his clennesse how that his sheep sholde lyv e . he sett e nat his benefice to hyr e  and leet his sheep encombr e d in the myr e , and ran to londoun, unto seint e poul e s, to seken hym a chaunterie for soul e s, or with a bretherhed to been withhold e ; but dwelte at hoom and kept e wel his fold e , so that the wolf ne made it nat myscari e ; he was a shepherde, and noght a mercenari e . and though he hooly were and vertuous, he was to synful man nat despitous, ne of his spech e daungerous ne dign e , but in his techyng díscreet and benygn e . to drawen folk to hevene by fairness e , by good ensample, this was his bisyness e . but it were any persone obstinat, what so he were, of heigh or lough estat, hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys. a bettr e preest i trowe that nowher noon ys. he waited after no pompe and reverenc e , ne maked him a spic e d conscienc e ;

ther was noon auditour koude on him wynn e . wel wiste he, by the droghte and by the reyn, the yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn. his lord e s sheep, his neet, his day e ry e , his swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultry e , was hoolly in this rev e s governyng; and by his covenant yaf the rekenyng syn that his lord was twenty yeer of ag e ; there koude no man brynge hym in arrerag e . there nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyn e , that he ne knew his sleighte and his covyn e ;

and eek ye knowen wel how that a jay kan clepen "watte" as wel as kan the pope. but whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope, thanne hadde he spent al his philosophi e ; ay "questio quid juris" wolde he cri e . he was a gentil harlot and a kynd e ;

and also war him of a significavit. in daunger hadde he at his owen e gise the yong e girl e s of the diocis e , and knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed. a gerland hadde he set upon his heed, as greet as it were for an al e -stak e ; a bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cak e .  with hym ther rood a gentil pardoner of rouncivale, his freend and his compeer, that streight was comen fro the court of rom e . ful loude he soong, "com hider, lov e , to me!" this somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun; was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun. this pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, but smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex; by ounces henge his lokk e s that he hadd e , and therwith he his shuldr e s overspradd e . but thynne it lay, by colpons, oon and oon;

i trowe he were a geldyng or a mar e . but of his craft, fro berwyk into war e , ne was ther swich another pardoner; for in his male he hadde a pilw e -beer, which that, he seyd e , was oure lady veyl;

and thus with feyn e d flaterye and jap e s he made the person and the peple his ap e s. but trew e ly to tellen att e last e , he was in chirche a noble ecclesiast e ; wel koude he rede a lessoun or a stori e , but alderbest he song an offertori e ; for wel he wist e , whan that song was song e , he moste preche, and wel affile his tong e  to wynn e silver, as he ful wel koud e ; therefore he song the murierly and loud e .  now have i toold you shortly, in a claus e , thestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the caus e  why that assembl e d was this compaigny e  in southwerk, at this gentil hostelry e  that highte the tabard, fast e by the bell e . but now is tym e to yow for to tell e  how that we baren us that ilk e nyght, whan we were in that hostelrie alyght;

 he (my captor) gave me a bisquit, which i put in my pocket, and not daring to eat it, buried it under a log, fearing he had put something in it to make me love him. —from the narrative of the captivity of mrs. mary rowlandson, who was taken prisoner by the wampanoag when lancaster, massachusetts, was destroyed, in the year 1676 the stream was swift, and so cold i thought i would be sliced in two. but he dragged me from the flood by the ends of my hair. i had grown to recognize his face. i could distinguish it from the others. there were times i feared i understood his language, which was not human, and i knelt to pray for strength.  we were pursued by god’s agents or pitch devils, i did not know. only that we must march. their guns were loaded with swan shot. i could not suckle and my child’s wail put them in danger. he had a woman with teeth black and glittering. she fed the child milk of acorns. the forest closed, the light deepened.  i told myself that i would starve before i took food from his hands but i did not starve. one night he killed a deer with a young one in her and gave me to eat of the fawn. it was so tender, the bones like the stems of flowers, that i followed where he took me. the night was thick. he cut the cord that bound me to the tree.  after that the birds mocked. shadows gaped and roared and the trees flung down their sharpened lashes. he did not notice god’s wrath. god blasted fire from half-buried stumps. i hid my face in my dress, fearing he would burn us all but this, too, passed.  rescued, i see no truth in things. my husband drives a thick wedge through the earth, still it shuts to him year after year. my child is fed of the first wheat. i lay myself to sleep on a holland-laced pillowbeer. i lay to sleep. and in the dark i see myself as i was outside their circle.  they knelt on deerskins, some with sticks, and he led his company in the noise until i could no longer bear the thought of how i was. i stripped a branch and struck the earth, in time, begging it to open to admit me as he was and feed me honey from the rock.

 my mind is shuffling its deck tonight, slipping one card over another, letting them all fall together at the corners; the random hand of memory is dealing from the bottom of the pack.  first: a bearded man emptying the dragon kiln, then a woman whistling, her face turned away as she opens the oven. next: a big cat, six toes on each paw, climbing up the yardpole. last: a pair of workhorses circling a tree until they grind themselves to dust.  there is no one home in the world tonight. everyone is out of range. the cradles are empty, the boughs broken down. trees go helter-skelter and the wheel is creaking on its shaft. hit me, i say to the dealer. hit me again.

 even the wind wants to become a cart pulled by butterflies.  i remember madness leaning for the first time on the mind’s pillow. i was talking to my body then and my body was an idea i wrote in red.  red is the sun’s most beautiful throne and all the other colors worship on red rugs.  night is another candle. in every branch, an arm, a message carried in space echoed by the body of the wind.  the sun insists on dressing itself in fog when it meets me: am i being scolded by the light?  oh, my past days— they used to walk in their sleep and i used to lean on them.  love and dreams are two parentheses. between them i place my body and discover the world.  many times i saw the air fly with two grass feet and the road dance with feet made of air.  my wishes are flowers staining my days.  i was wounded early, and early i learned that wounds made me.  i still follow the child who still walks inside me.  now he stands at a staircase made of light searching for a corner to rest in and to read the face of night again.  if the moon were a house, my feet would refuse to touch its doorstep.  they are taken by dust carrying me to the air of seasons.  i walk, one hand in the air, the other caressing tresses that i imagine.  a star is also a pebble in the field of space.  he alone who is joined to the horizon can build new roads.  a moon, an old man, his seat is night and light is his walking stick.  what shall i say to the body i abandoned in the rubble of the house in which i was born? no one can narrate my childhood except those stars that flicker above it and that leave footprints on the evening’s path.  my childhood is still being born in the palms of a light whose name i do not know and who names me.  out of that river he made a mirror and asked it about his sorrow. he made rain out of his grief and imitated the clouds.  your childhood is a village. you will never cross its boundaries no matter how far you go.  his days are lakes, his memories floating bodies.  you who are descending from the mountains of the past, how can you climb them again, and why?  time is a door i cannot open. my magic is worn, my chants asleep.  i was born in a village, small and secretive like a womb. i never left it. i love the ocean not the shores.

 first:       brother, remove the tool marks on your scathed skin, brush your tattoos with nettles, smear bearberry juice in the gashes. crack open the jail-seed.  second:   tear away the bars which restrain your lean, spare life. bend your curves in a knot. brother, smudge your saw-tooth edges.  third:      cut red seaweed to conceal your gray cadaver; start wetting your skin down; after scraping, drip your bowels of blood, change into wolf.  fourth:    the savannah sparrow flies north. in speech, smell fine-grained hawthorn. collapse your voice into bark and howl.

 into a crock of gold he’d set some weeds, behold swart devils in the sunniest weather; he would lump the saint and the courtesan together, most miserably jangling all the creeds.  the prurient multitude heard he was mad, yet nosed his books for some pornography. the censors doubted his virginity, and secretly conned the works that they forbade.  reporters found this dangerous oddity in rusty pantaloons, mowing the green, and wondered how so dull a wretch could have seen a naked venus disturbing an alien sea.  he watched their backs receding down the street, raked up the grass, and suddenly had a vision of how venus, bathing, saw with amused derision behind the bushes peeping satyrs’ feet.

 you see them on porches and on lawns down by the lakeside, usually arranged in pairs implying a couple  who might sit there and look out at the water or the big shade trees. the trouble is you never see anyone  sitting in these forlorn chairs though at one time it must have seemed a good place to stop and do nothing for a while.  sometimes there is a little table between the chairs where no one is resting a glass or placing a book facedown.  it might be none of my business, but it might be a good idea one day for everyone who placed those vacant chairs  on a veranda or a dock to sit down in them for the sake of remembering whatever it was they thought deserved  to be viewed from two chairs side by side with a table in between. the clouds are high and massive that day.  the woman looks up from her book. the man takes a sip of his drink. then there is nothing but the sound of their looking,  the lapping of lake water, and a call of one bird then another, cries of joy or warning— it passes the time to wonder which.

 if we change as she is changing,  if she changes as we change   (if she changes, i am changing)   who is changing, as i bend  down to what the sky has sent us?   (is she changing, or the same?)  
NEW POEM
 the nicest child i ever knew was charles augustus fortescue. he never lost his cap, or tore his stockings or his pinafore: in eating bread he made no crumbs, he was extremely fond of sums, to which, however, he preferred the parsing of a latin word— he sought, when it was within his power, for information twice an hour, and as for finding mutton-fat unappatising, far from that! he often, at his father’s board, would beg them, of his own accord, to give him, if they did not mind, the greasiest morsels they could find— his later years did not belie the promise of his infancy. in public life he always tried to take a judgement broad and wide; in private, none was more than he renowned for quiet courtesy. he rose at once in his career, and long before his fortieth year had wedded fifi, only child of bunyan, first lord aberfylde. he thus became immensely rich, and built the splendid mansion which is called the cedars, muswell hill, where he resides in affluence still, to show what everybody might become by simply doing right.  
NEW POEM
 on seeing some pictures of the interior of his house, washington, d.c. only the casket left, the jewel gone whose noble presence filled these stately rooms, and made this spot a shrine where pilgrims came— stranger and friend—to bend in reverence before the great, pure soul that knew no guile; to listen to the wise and gracious words that fell from lips whose rare, exquisite smile gave tender beauty to the grand, grave face.  upon these pictured walls we see thy peers,— poet, and saint, and sage, painter, and king,— a glorious band;—they shine upon us still; still gleam in marble the enchanting forms whereupon thy artist eye delighted dwelt; thy favorite psyche droops her matchless face, listening, methinks, for the beloved voice which nevermore on earth shall sound her praise.  all these remain,—the beautiful, the brave, the gifted, silent ones; but thou art gone! fair is the world that smiles upon us now; blue are the skies of june, balmy the air that soothes with touches soft the weary brow; and perfect days glide into perfect nights,— moonlit and calm; but still our grateful hearts are sad, and faint with fear,— for thou art gone!  oh friend beloved, with longing, tear-filled eyes we look up, up to the unclouded blue, and seek in vain some answering sign from thee. look down upon us, guide and cheer us still from the serene height where thou dwellest now; dark is the way without the beacon light which long and steadfastly thy hand upheld. oh, nerve with courage new the stricken hearts whose dearest hopes seem lost in losing thee.  
NEW POEM
 rocked in my mother’s pregnant amble, and born into forty-five years in the dark, the egg this child was also swayed in the arts of lovers i took before you, fed with me  in the public markets of baltimore and denpasar on oysters and rambutan, woke with me each year to new waves of wander, fish and flower, liqueur of each region, and bread of each village,  each cup of moonlight in the long sward between my window and the wannsee. the egg he was heard and voices of everyone i desired and held itself  in some deep hormonal bloom, taking whatever was remarkable in my life into its possibility. we learned not to hurry in balinese rain,  to listen for the rumble of wild boar in the malvan woods. we climbed into planes bound for cities we’d never visit again and skin we’d summon  with sobbing. and so, my husband, as you dream of owning this child, remember that he has ridden in my fire, bathed in my blood, and sipped  at the breath i drew the first time i saw what rodin had clawed from stone before he turned from claudel and went home for dinner and a clean shirt.  remember that this child is collage of everything before you, frangipani and escargot, five-for-a-dollar boxes of macaroni, and french cherries  from an old woman in auvergne who insisted on the gift because it was so marvelous to see a woman traveling alone.

 race, friends, is boring.  everyone says so. hashtag all lives matter, the channel turns, we ourselves live and turn, and moreover the tv told me yesterday (unendingly) ‘ever to talk about race means you have no  inner resources.’ i conclude now i have no inner resources, because all i see is race. people have race, literature has race, especially great literature, henry has race, with his blacks &amp; whites made up as his feelings  about love &amp; sex &amp; art, which have race. and our social ills, &amp; sin, in chinese drag are somehow a dog that’s eaten itself, &amp; its tail miserably remains as our mirror, bone or breaker, heaving on tide: us, flag.  
NEW POEM
 for my parents, choi inyeong &amp; nam songeun in the first grade i asked my mother permission to go by frances at school. at seven years old,  i already knew the exhaustion of hearing my name butchered by hammerhead tongues. already knew  to let my salty gook name drag behind me in the sand, safely out of sight. in fourth grade  i wanted to be a writer &amp; worried about how to escape my surname — choi  is nothing if not korean, if not garlic breath, if not seaweed &amp; sesame &amp; food stamps  during the lean years — could i go by f.j.c.? could i be paper thin &amp; raceless? dust jacket &amp; coffee stain,  boneless rumor smoldering behind the curtain &amp; speaking through an ink-stained puppet?  my father ran through all his possible rechristenings — ian, isaac, ivan — and we laughed at each one,  knowing his accent would always give him away. you can hear the pride in my mother’s voice  when she answers the phone this is grace, &amp; it is some kind of strange grace she’s spun herself,  some lightning made of chain mail. grace is not her pseudonym, though everyone in my family is a poet.  these are the shields for the names we speak in the dark to remember our darkness. savage death rites  we still practice in the new world. myths we whisper to each other to keep warm. my korean name  is the star my mother cooks into the jjigae to follow home when i am lost, which is always  in this gray country, this violent foster home whose streets are paved with shame, this factory yard  riddled with bullies ready to steal your skin &amp; sell it back to your mother for profit,  land where they stuff our throats with soil &amp; accuse us of gluttony when we learn to swallow it.  i confess. i am greedy. i think i deserve to be seen for what i am: a boundless, burning wick.  a minor chord. i confess: if someone has looked at my crooked spine and called it elmwood,  i’ve accepted. if someone has loved me more for my gook name, for my saint name,  for my good vocabulary &amp; bad joints, i’ve welcomed them into this house.  i’ve cooked them each a meal with a star singing at the bottom of the bowl, a secret ingredient  to follow home when we are lost: sunflower oil, blood sausage, a name  given by your dead grandfather who eventually forgot everything he’d touched. i promise:  i’ll never stop stealing back what’s mine. i promise: i won’t forget again.

NEW POEM
 must be entered through the sharpener every sunday, else your name will be lovingly written in the book of the down arrow. the one steeple to every church rule breaks in half in the church of the open crayon box; the one bell to every steeple rule breaks off its tip. “climb stairs to the steeples,” the preacher commands, “and let every belltone ring out!” you can see the whole town from the steeple, and you exit the church through the view, and you walk through what calls itself  flagpole—the town is a blot on the town, but the railroad is coming out this way and we must give them a smear to see through the windows: now you pass the general store, that even your vaguest stick figure can enter, now you pass a vacant lot: the post office isn’t here yet, is only a set-aside space in the center of the country’s envelope; now you pass the voting- place, where we stuff our handwriting through a slit. tall trees fall in the pinewoods, tall telegraph poles are raised, and words inch along our wires: text text text stop, text text text stop.  and now you pass the feed store, which sells carrot and turnip and sugar-beet tops—only the visible parts—and now whitey balavender’s hardware, where everything hangs off the hook of its color, or color hangs off the hook of its all, where you work your hands into cool washers, and work hands into nailheads of the color blue, and watch whitey balavender busy himself pouring crayons into bullet molds. you show him a list that says “ax,” and he sells you a red line through it. all up and down main street ponies are covered with strokes as coarse as horse blankets. and once you have drawn the ponies you begin to draw the saddle shop, you grip the right color like a saddle horn and somehow keep from falling off, and you ride to the edge of town, where you draw the fur trading post, where they sell tails of any shy animal, the rest of the animal gone down a hole, where you trade in your skin for a possibles bag and wear possibles bag where your skin was. fat geese fly in any letter you like but you need red meat for once, and write a splayed- hide word like “deerslayer,” and take hold of the ending and drag it home,  and now you are almost there, now you are building the home with hand-drawn log cabin font, you are building it log by log of course and smoothing the logs with a color called adze, you are biting the crayon to notch the logs and driving in dots of nailheads. stumps of umber surround you, and the sky is beginning to look like sky. you are hoping a man can be really alone here; you are hoping your father can tell what it is; and now only the doorknob is left to draw and in your enthusiasm you shout at the paper, and the weather changes just in time, not raining, beginning to spit.  
NEW POEM
 acts of love have material effects. for a woman  tending the sacred fire, these include the risk of becoming  an extinguisher of flames essential  to civic life. it is a burden to put out  what others hold as central to faith in coherence. acts of faith  have material effects — a vestal virgin touched by encounter  must be buried alive, a beautiful metaphor  for shame itself, which squirms even under all that dirt. thus, the dead  learn too late that devotion should be  unidirectional, a straight line from here to suffocation. love must not  bleed at the edges, must not meet others in the banal spaces  of civic life. it is a burden to personify. if vesta’s hearth is the site  of the sacred, its material effects are destruction: burning, consumption,  constant hunger for more wood. acts  of destruction have fantasmatic effects. for a body  surviving encounter, these include civic life, shame;  the risk of being a proxy — tender  of the hearth belonging to the public, by way  of the goddess, who embodies a dream of faith in coherence. material effects  extinguish themselves, eventually, as when a woman  touched in the correct way undoes the burden  of love and puts out, taking the goddamn city in and under.  
NEW POEM
 he gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and i could stand amused all afternoon in the hon kee grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh i know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass. i step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick.  such a sorrowful chinese face, nomad, gobi, northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. he could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. in his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he’d mumble his favorite passages. he could be my grandfather; come to america to get a western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother.  he lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel.  the head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and i see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death? is this how i, too, recoil from my day? see how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. see its grease on the blade. is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open. is this how i presided over my century, is this how i regarded the murders? this is also how i prayed. was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed? this too was how i slept, clutching my wife. was it me in the other i loved when i loved another? the butcher sees me eye this delicacy. with a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. i eat my man.  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover’s heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. these are the faces i love, the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day’s end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands.  brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. in a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. all are beautiful by variety. the soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. god is the text. the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic.  a bright moment, i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me, and i feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. what is it in me would devour the world to utter it? what is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. i would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man’s hands, i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, i would eat it all to utter it. the deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, i would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these chinatown deaths, these american deaths. i would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world.

 walking back to the office after lunch, i saw hans. “mister isham, mister isham,” he called out in his hurry, “herr wegner needs you. a woman waiting for a border pass took poison, she is dead, and the police are there to take the body.” in the hall, the secretaries stood outside their doors silently waiting with wegner. “sir,” he said, “it was her answer on the questionnaire, a clerk for the gestapo. so it was.” within the outer office, by the row of wooden chairs, one lying on its side, on the discolored brown linoleum floor under a gi blanket was the lost unmoving shape; uncovered, from a fold, a dirty foot half out of a dirty shoe, once white, heel bent, the sole worn through, the skin bruised red and calloused, uncut toenails curved and veined like an old ivory. no one spoke. police stood at attention by a stretcher. after an empty moment, suddenly bent over as if taken by a cramp, i sobbed out loud and, on my uniform, vomited up my lunch—over the tie, the polished buttons and insignia, the little strips of color and the green eisenhower jacket with its eagle patch, the taut pants in a crease, the glistening jump-boots— vomiting and still sobbing, like a child awakened in the night, and sick. wegner and hans held me, murmuring, “ach, dear sir, the war is over and not over, such things happen.” while no one else moved, frau schmidt brought a towel to clean me off before hans walked me back, my arm across his shoulders and i retelling the story of how, near zell am see, we found, hung from a tree in leaf, the final sack of bones, in rotted wehrmacht green. in the house an ss lord had furnished for his mistress— deep sofas, persian rugs, and velvet drapes— frau könig took my clothes. in my own room, wearing the gucci robe bouchard had taken from a fine house before we got to ulm, instead of lying down to rest, i studied the book i read for german with frau schmidt, goethe’s italian journey . through the window, the watchman’s upper slopes were shadows, green and purple with the afternoon, its snows melting, its double peaks the victory sign.

 when i take my scissors to your shirts, i am frightened: not that they will whimper but that they won’t understand the violence i mean. that kind of violence is the other side of love,  bright as a light-saber and permanent as the angel’s swords above eden barring that couple with a final x, that violence means a love strong as death.  once sie ist mein leben, you said, meaning me and i took those words personally and knocked upon the door of my heart until all its birds flooded to you, in a rush—  like the iroquois, i tugged on our peace-pipe, i wrote your name in smoke. then went home with my pockets rolling in shining glass beads, my pockets so rich with the coin of your country.

 the gates clanged and they walked you into jail more tense than felons but relieved to find the hostile world shut out, the flags that dripped from every mother’s windowpane, obscene the bloodlust sweating from the public heart, the dog authority slavering at your throat. a sense of quiet, of pulling down the blind possessed you. punishment you felt was clean.  the decks, the catwalks, and the narrow light composed a ship. this was a mutinous crew troubling the captains for plain decencies, a mayflower brim with pilgrims headed out to establish new theocracies to west, a noah’s ark coasting the topmost seas ten miles above the sodomites and fish. these inmates loved the only living doves.  like all men hunted from the world you made a good community, voyaging the storm to no safe plymouth or green ararat; trouble or calm, the men with bibles prayed, the gaunt politicals construed our hate. the opposite of all armies, you were best opposing uniformity and yourselves; prison and personality were your fate.  you suffered not so physically but knew maltreatment, hunger, ennui of the mind. well might the soldier kissing the hot beach erupting in his face damn all your kind. yet you who saved neither yourselves nor us are equally with those who shed the blood the heroes of our cause. your conscience is what we come back to in the armistice.

 we had to sleep in the streets. not on the sidewalks, in the streets.  cause the sidewalks was full of urine and body waste, dead bodies.  and we had to sleep out there, in the hell of waste and the dead bodies.  i walked from water up to my neck to get to the convention center.  there was dead dogs, dead rodents, you had to push all that kind of mess out of the way,  hoping that it didn’t touch you. i was pushing them out the way,  so many dead bodies coming from the ninth ward up our way and they had people that was drowned up my way.  now this convention center wasn’t nothing nice, i kid you not.  people still crying and begging to go home. there’s nothing there.  you have no running water. you have no lights. the place stinks. it’s contaminated.  i’ve been there twice. i died there, i died.  me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister and her thirty-two-year-old son,  we lived out there seven days. five days we had no food. no water.  every night and every day the military people was throwing down on us  like we was a bunch of wild animals. they was on a hunt to kill.  they killed one guy right there in front of us, run over him with a police car  and then they shot the man and left him there. they didn’t cover him up or nothing  and the next day, it was so hot out there,  when they did come to pick him up, his body was stuck to the ground.  so i can understand you want to keep control of the people,  but why have those people draw guns on children? women with babies in their stomachs.  every time you look around we breaking and running, trying to get into the convention center  and they’re drawing guns on people like that. i mean, it don’t make no kinda sense.  they wouldn’t let you leave. you had to stay there.  cause we smelled like — i’m serious — because everybody was smelling the same way —  smelling like sewer, like shit, piss. that was the scariest time of my life.  and we had to have that on us because we ain’t had no water, we ain’t had no sewer.  there wasn’t no limit on it because you had to scrub yourself just to get the scent out of your skin  because, like i said, they knew they have a lot of poor people like myself don’t have no transportation,  don’t have no money. well i have a car but it got under the water.  me, my ten-year-old daughter, my sister and her thirty-two year-old son, we lived out there seven days.  we looked for her for an hour and thirty minutes in the convention center.  five days we had no food. no water. i seen children die, i seen old people die,  i seen murders, i seen rapes. i seen people murder people then cut their heads off.  we already knew that the killer people were putting them in the icebox,  killing little children and raping little children. the men, the looters, the people that was staying in there.  i am telling you, that was the most horriblest experience i have ever seen in my life.  i seen the troops shoot people. they ride around with guns almost like we was in a prison camp.  no, the place wasn’t on fire. it was some children upstairs playing with the fire extinguisher.  like hell. and like i said, i never in my life grew up in a house with millions of people.  you know, i’ve always had my own room, my own, you know, my own, i was always — just —  in the convention center, the buses came in. every night. every day they was telling us  “the buses is coming, the buses is coming.” the buses passed right there in front of us and kept going!  the people was there to see the buses so everybody run, rushing the buses to get on the damn buses and get out of there.  every day they was moving us around, go here, go there, the buses is gonna meet you here, meet you there.  they was lying. there was never no buses, they was lying. they was just making us tired. they had us in there to kill us.  we used to look up at the bridge and see all the buses going that way to the superdome,  or to the hospital, or to the people in those condos, getting them all out of there and going back.  buses going back again, buses leaving out new orleans again. that’s how it was.  it was nopd police but it wasn’t our regular district police.  these were special nopd policemen. we was running from place to place telling them,  “oh, this person dead, that person dead.” they said, “well we can’t do nothing about no dead bodies.  y’all just don’t worry. y’all just try to get the fuck out of here.”  they say, “y’all go to the bridge. the bus’s going to pick you up on the bridge.”  i think it was they job to send the national guards and the armored people in there  to make sure everybody was evacuated. they left us out there for five, six, seven days.  we stayed on the bridge nine hours. they didn’t care about us.  the first thing they dropped into us was boxes of cigarettes. not food. not water. boxes of cigarettes.  two hours later they drop us water. and half of it burst open cause they was so high up when they dropped it.  two hours after that they drop us some army food in a box we got to pour water in to heat up.  we was hungry, we had no other choice.  the news got us out. not the national guard, not the mayor, not blanco, the news people is the only ones who got us out.  channel 26 got me out. channel 26. the rest of them was there to kill us.  i got tired of convention centers. i wanted to come the hell up out of that damn convention center.

 we’d gained our first objective hours before while dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes, pallid, unshaven and thirsty, blind with smoke. things seemed all right at first. we held their line, with bombers posted, lewis guns well placed, and clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench. the place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs high-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps and trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud, wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled; and naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair, bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime. and then the rain began,—the jolly old rain!  a yawning soldier knelt against the bank, staring across the morning blear with fog; he wondered when the allemands would get busy; and then, of course, they started with five-nines traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud. mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell, while posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke. he crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear, sick for escape,—loathing the strangled horror and butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.  an officer came blundering down the trench: “stand-to and man the fire step!” on he went ... gasping and bawling, “fire-step ... counter-attack!” then the haze lifted. bombing on the right down the old sap: machine-guns on the left; and stumbling figures looming out in front. “o christ, they’re coming at us!” bullets spat, and he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ... and started blazing wildly ... then a bang crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out to grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked and fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom, lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans ... down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned, bleeding to death. the counter-attack had failed.

 born again on a monday under a broken zodiac.  my father the woodman, a surgeon among snags, could read the living trail of blades rebounding in the field, the mopped-matte passage through the dew.  he woke a brush pile with fire throwing shadows on the child, i was thrown over.  father, it was a pleasure to meet you on this luminous route between two lives.  in this impromptu pool reaped from rain where mosquitos multiply.  though survival, i’m told, is impersonal and without teleological purpose. malaria is just trying to maximize its own fitness  as are the corporations who, for palm oil set the peatlands ablaze and drained the water table.   dense haze from the sea choked the light from day  suffused our mountain in a numinous red corona. and as for the getting over  there will be no ascension, no circumambulation, there is only going through.  we must go through it.

 instead of a cup of tea, instead of a milk- silk whelk of a cup, of a cup of nearly six o'clock teatime, cup of a stumbling block, cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk, cup of a cut brown loaf, of a slice, a lack of butter, blueberry jam that's almost black, instead of tannin seeping into the cracks of a pot, the void of an hour seeps out, infects the slit of a cut i haven't the wit to fix with a surgeon's needle threaded with fine-gauge silk as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock. but no key threads the cylinder of a lock. late afternoon light, transitory, licks the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue, flicks itself out beneath the wheel's revolving spoke. taut thought's gone, with a blink of attention, slack, a vision of "death and distance in the mix" (she lost her words and how did she get them back when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck? the dream-life logic encodes in nervous tics she translated to a syntax which connects intense and unfashionable politics with morning coffee, hudson sunsets, sex; then the short-circuit of the final stroke, the end toward which all lines looped out, then broke). what a gaze out the window interjects: on the southeast corner, a black lab balks, tugged as the light clicks green toward a late-day walk by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak. the bronx-bound local comes rumbling up the tracks out of the tunnel, over west harlem blocks whose windows gleam on the animal warmth of bricks rouged by the fluvial light of six o'clock.  
NEW POEM
 a woman moves through dog rose and juniper bushes, a pussy clean and folded between her legs, breasts like the tips of her festive shoes shine silently in her heavy armoire.  one blackbird, one cow, one horse. the sea beats against the wall of the waterless. she walks to a phone booth that waits a fair distance from all three villages.  it’s a game she could have heard on the radio: a question, a number, an answer, a prize. her pussy reaches up and turns on the light in her womb.  
NEW POEM
 the rain’s cold grains are silver-gray sharp as golden sands, a bell is clanging, people sway hanging by their hands.  supple hands, or gnarled and stiff, snatch and catch and grope; that face is yellow-pale, as if the fellow swung from rope.  dull like pebbles, sharp like knives, glances strike and glare, fingers tangle, bluebeard’s wives dangle by the hair.  orchard of the strangest fruits hanging from the skies; brothers, yet insensate brutes who fear each others’ eyes.  one man stands as free men stand as if his soul might be brave, unbroken; see his hand nailed to an oaken tree.

 day of satan's painful duty! earth shall vanish, hot and sooty; so says virtue, so says beauty.  ah! what terror shall be shaping when the judge the truth's undraping— cats from every bag escaping!  now the trumpet's invocation calls the dead to condemnation; all receive an invitation.  death and nature now are quaking, and the late lamented, waking, in their breezy shrouds are shaking.  lo! the ledger's leaves are stirring, and the clerk, to them referring, makes it awkward for the erring.  when the judge appears in session, we shall all attend confession, loudly preaching non-suppression.  how shall i then make romances mitigating circumstances? even the just must take their chances.  king whose majesty amazes, save thou him who sings thy praises; fountain, quench my private blazes.  pray remember, sacred saviour, mine the playful hand that gave your death-blow. pardon such behavior.  seeking me, fatigue assailed thee, calvary's outlook naught availed thee; now 'twere cruel if i failed thee.  righteous judge and learnèd brother, pray thy prejudices smother ere we meet to try each other.  sighs of guilt my conscience gushes, and my face vermilion flushes; spare me for my pretty blushes.  thief and harlot, when repenting, thou forgavest—complimenting me with sign of like relenting.  if too bold is my petition i'll receive with due submission my dismissal—from perdition.  when thy sheep thou hast selected from the goats, may i, respected, stand amongst them undetected.  when offenders are indited, and with trial-flames ignited, elsewhere i'll attend if cited.  ashen-hearted, prone and prayerful, when of death i see the air full, lest i perish too be careful.  on that day of lamentation, when, to enjoy the conflagration, men come forth, o be not cruel: spare me, lord—make them thy fuel.  
NEW POEM
 still half drunk, after a night at cards, with the grey dawn taking us unaware among our guilty kings and queens, we drove far north in the morning, winners, losers, to a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a place one of us knew, with some vague view of cutting losses or consolidating gains by the old standard appeal to the wilderness, the desert, the empty places of our exile, bringing only the biblical bread and cheese and cigarettes got from a grocer’s on the way, expecting to drink only the clear cold water among the stones, and remember, or forget. though no one said anything about atonement, there was still some purgatorial idea in all those aching heads and ageing hearts as we climbed the giant stair of the stream, reaching the place around noon.  it was as promised, a wonder, with granite walls enclosing ledges, long and flat, of limestone, or, rolling, of lava; within the ledges the water, fast and still, pouring its yellow light, and green, over the tilted slabs of the floor, blackened at shady corners, falling in a foam of crystal to a calm where the waterlight dappled the ledges as they leaned against the sun; big blue dragonflies hovered and darted and dipped a wing, hovered again against the low wind moving over the stream, and shook the flakes of light from their clear wings. this surely was it, was what we had come for, was nature, though it looked like art with its grey fortress walls and laminated benches as in the waiting room of some petrified station. but we believed; and what it was we believed made of the place a paradise for ruined poker players, win or lose, who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks like gasping trout (the water they drank making them drunk again), lit cigarettes and lay back waiting for nature to say the last word —as though the stones were memnon stones, which, caught in a certain light, would sing.  the silence (and even the noise of the waters was silence) grew pregnant; that is the phrase, grew pregnant; but nothing else did. the mountains brought forth not a mouse, and the rocks, unlike the ones you would expect to find on the slopes of purgatory or near helicon, mollified by muses and with a little give to ’em, were modern american rocks, and hard as rocks. our easy bones groaned, our flesh baked on one side and shuddered on the other; and each man thought bitterly about primitive simplicity and decadence, and how he had been ruined by civilization and forced by circumstances to drink and smoke and sit up all night inspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards until he was broken-winded as a trout on a rock and had no use for the doctrines of jean jacques rousseau, and could no longer afford a savagery whether noble or not; some would never batter that battered copy of walden again.  but all the same, the water, the sunlight, and the wind did something; even the dragonflies did something to the minds full of telephone numbers and flushes, to the flesh sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other. and the rocks, the old and tumbling boulders which formed the giant stair of the stream, induced (again) some purgatorial ideas concerning humility, concerning patience and enduring what had to be endured, winning and losing and breaking even; ideas of weathering in whatever weather, being eroded, or broken, or ground down into pebbles by the stream’s necessitous and grave currents. but to these ideas did any purgatory respond? only this one: that in a world where even the memnon stones were carved in soap one might at any rate wash with the soap.  after a time we talked about the war, about what we had done in the war, and how near some of us had been to being drowned, and burned, and shot, and how many people we knew who had been drowned, or burned, or shot; and would it have been better to have died in the war, the peaceful old war, where we were young? but the mineral peace, or paralysis, of those great stones, the moving stillness of the waters, entered our speech; the ribs and blood of the earth, from which all fables grow, established poetry and truth in us, so that at last one said, “i shall play cards until the day i die,” and another said, “in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins and minerals needed to sustain man’s life,” and still another, “i shall live on smoke until my spirit has been cured of flesh.”  climbing downstream again, on the way home to the lives we had left empty for a day, we noticed, as not before, how of three bridges not one had held the stream, which in its floods had twisted the girders, splintered the boards, hurled boulder on boulder, and had broken into rubble, smashed practically back to nature, the massive masonry of span after span with its indifferent rage; this was a sight that sobered us considerably, and kept us quiet both during the long drive home and after, till it was time to deal the cards.

 i  when bishop berkeley said "there was no matter," and proved it—'twas no matter what he said: they say his system 'tis in vain to batter, too subtle for the airiest human head; and yet who can believe it! i would shatter gladly all matters down to stone or lead, or adamant, to find the world a spirit, and wear my head, denying that i wear it.  ii  what a sublime discovery 'twas to make the universe universal egotism, that all's ideal—all ourselves: i'll stake the world (be it what you will) that that's no schism. oh doubt!—if thou be'st doubt, for which some take thee, but which i doubt extremely—thou sole prism of the truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit! heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.  iii  for ever and anon comes indigestion (not the most "dainty ariel") and perplexes our soarings with another sort of question: and that which after all my spirit vexes, is, that i find no spot where man can rest eye on, without confusion of the sorts and sexes, of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder, the world, which at the worst's a glorious blunder—  iv  if it be chance—or, if it be according to the old text, still better: lest it should turn out so, we'll say nothing 'gainst the wording, as several people think such hazards rude. they're right; our days are too brief for affording space to dispute what no one ever could decide, and everybody one day will know very clearly—or at least lie still.  v  and therefore will i leave off metaphysical discussion, which is neither here nor there: if i agree that what is, is; then this i call being quite perspicuous and extremely fair. the truth is, i've grown lately rather phthisical: i don't know what the reason is—the air perhaps; but as i suffer from the shocks of illness, i grow much more orthodox.  vi  the first attack at once prov'd the divinity (but that i never doubted, nor the devil); the next, the virgin's mystical virginity; the third, the usual origin of evil; the fourth at once establish'd the whole trinity on so uncontrovertible a level, that i devoutly wish'd the three were four— on purpose to believe so much the more.  vii  to our theme.—the man who has stood on the acropolis, and look'd down over attica; or he who has sail'd where picturesque constantinople is, or seen timbuctoo, or hath taken tea in small-ey'd china's crockery-ware metropolis, or sat amidst the bricks of nineveh, may not think much of london's first appearance— but ask him what he thinks of it a year hence!  viii  don juan had got out on shooter's hill; sunset the time, the place the same declivity which looks along that vale of good and ill where london streets ferment in full activity, while everything around was calm and still, except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he heard, and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum of cities, that boil over with their scum—  ix  i say, don juan, wrapp'd in contemplation, walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit, and lost in wonder of so great a nation, gave way to't, since he could not overcome it. "and here," he cried, "is freedom's chosen station; here peals the people's voice nor can entomb it racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection awaits it, each new meeting or election.  x  "here are chaste wives, pure lives; her people pay but what they please; and if that things be dear, 'tis only that they love to throw away their cash, to show how much they have a-year. here laws are all inviolate; none lay traps for the traveller; every highway's clear; here"—he was interrupted by a knife, with—"damn your eyes! your money or your life!"  xi  these free-born sounds proceeded from four pads in ambush laid, who had perceiv'd him loiter behind his carriage; and, like handy lads, had seiz'd the lucky hour to reconnoitre, in which the heedless gentleman who gads upon the road, unless he prove a fighter may find himself within that isle of riches expos'd to lose his life as well as breeches.  xii  juan, who did not understand a word of english, save their shibboleth, "god damn!" and even that he had so rarely heard, he sometimes thought 'twas only their salam," or "god be with you!"—and 'tis not absurd to think so, for half english as i am (to my misfortune) never can i say i heard them wish "god with you," save that way—  xiii  juan yet quickly understood their gesture, and being somewhat choleric and sudden, drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture, and fired it into one assailant's pudding, who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture, and roar'd out, as he writh'd his native mud in, unto his nearest follower or henchman, "oh jack! i'm floor'd by that ere bloody frenchman!"  xiv  on which jack and his train set off at speed, and juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance, came up, all marvelling at such a deed, and offering, as usual, late assistance. juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed as if his veins would pour out his existence, stood calling out for bandages and lint, and wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.  xv  "perhaps,"thought he,"it is the country's wont to welcome foreigners in this way: now i recollect some innkeepers who don't differ, except in robbing with a bow, in lieu of a bare blade and brazen front. but what is to be done? i can't allow the fellow to lie groaning on the road: so take him up, i'll help you with the load."  xvi  but ere they could perform this pious duty, the dying man cried, "hold! i've got my gruel! oh! for a glass of max! we've miss'd our booty— let me die where i am!" and as the fuel of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty the drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill his breath, he from his swelling throat untied a kerchief, crying "give sal that!"—and died.  xvii  the cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down before don juan's feet: he could not tell exactly why it was before him thrown, nor what the meaning of the man's farewell. poor tom was once a kiddy upon town, a thorough varmint, and a real swell, full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled, his pockets first and then his body riddled.  xviii  don juan, having done the best he could in all the circumstances of the case, as soon as "crowner's 'quest" allow'd, pursu'd his travels to the capital apace; esteeming it a little hard he should in twelve hours' time, and very little space, have been oblig'd to slay a free-born native in self-defence: this made him meditative.  xix  he from the world had cut off a great man, who in his time had made heroic bustle. who in a row like tom could lead the van, booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle? who queer a flat? who (spite of bowstreet's ban) on the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle? who on a lark, with black-eyed sal (his blowing), so prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?  xx  but tom's no more—and so no more of tom. heroes must die; and by god's blessing 'tis not long before the most of them go home. hail! thamis, hail! upon thy verge it is that juan's chariot, rolling like a drum in thunder, holds the way it can't well miss, through kennington and all the other "tons," which make us wish ourselves in town at once;  xxi  through groves, so called as being void of trees, (like lucus from no light); through prospects nam'd mount pleasant, as containing nought to please, nor much to climb; through little boxes fram'd of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease, with "to be let," upon their doors proclaim'd; through "rows" most modestly call'd "paradise," which eve might quit without much sacrifice;  xxii  through coaches, drays, chok'd turnpikes, and a whirl of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion; here taverns wooing to a pint of "purl," there mails fast flying off like a delusion; there barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl in windows; here the lamplighter's infusion slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass (for in those days we had not got to gas);  xxiii  through this, and much, and more, is the approach of travellers to mighty babylon: whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach, with slight exceptions, all the ways seem one. i could say more, but do not choose to encroach upon the guide-book's privilege. the sun had set some time, and night was on the ridge of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge.  xxiv  that's rather fine, the gentle sound of thamis— who vindicates a moment, too, his stream— though hardly heard through multifarious "damme's": the lamps of westminster's more regular gleam, the breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is a spectral resident—whose pallid beam in shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile— make this a sacred part of albion's isle.  xxv  the druid's groves are gone—so much the better: stonehenge is not—but what the devil is it?— but bedlam still exists with its sage fetter, that madmen may not bite you on a visit; the bench too seats or suits full many a debtor; the mansion house too (though some people quiz it) to me appears a stiff yet grand erection; but then the abbey's worth the whole collection.  xxvi  the line of lights too, up to charing cross, pall mall, and so forth, have a coruscation like gold as in comparison to dross, match'd with the continent's illumination, whose cities night by no means deigns to gloss. the french were not yet a lamp-lighting nation, and when they grew so—on their new-found lantern, instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.  xxvii  a row of gentlemen along the streets suspended may illuminate mankind, as also bonfires made of country seats; but the old way is best for the purblind: the other looks like phosphorus on sheets, a sort of ignis fatuus to the mind, which, though 'tis certain to perplex and frighten, must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.  xxviii  but london's so well lit, that if diogenes could recommence to hunt his honest man and found him not amidst the various progenies of this enormous city's spreading spawn, 'twere not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his yet undiscover'd treasure. what i can, i've done to find the same throughout life's journey, but see the world is only one attorney.  xxix  over the stones still rattling, up pall mall, through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner as thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner admitted a small party as night fell, don juan, our young diplomatic sinner, pursu'd his path, and drove past some hotels, st. james's palace, and st. james's "hells."  xxx  they reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door a tide of well-clad waiters, and around the mob stood, and as usual several score of those pedestrian paphians who abound in decent london when the daylight's o'er; commodious but immoral, they are found useful, like malthus, in promoting marriage: but juan now is stepping from his carriage  xxxi  into one of the sweetest of hotels, especially for foreigners—and mostly for those whom favour or whom fortune swells, and cannot find a bill's small items costly. there many an envoy either dwelt or dwells (the den of many a diplomatic lost lie), until to some conspicuous square they pass, and blazon o'er the door their names in brass.  xxxii  juan, whose was a delicate commission, private, though publicly important, bore no title to point out with due precision the exact affair on which he was sent o'er. 'twas merely known, that on a secret mission a foreigner of rank had grac'd our shore, young, handsome and accomplish'd, who was said (in whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.  xxxiii  some rumour also of some strange adventures had gone before him, and his wars and loves; and as romantic heads are pretty painters, and, above all, an englishwoman's roves into the excursive, breaking the indentures of sober reason, wheresoe'er it moves, he found himself extremely in the fashion, which serves our thinking people for a passion.  xxxiv  i don't mean that they are passionless, but quite the contrary; but then 'tis in the head; yet as the consequences are as bright as if they acted with the heart instead, what after all can signify the site of ladies' lucubrations? so they lead in safety to the place for which you start, what matters if the road be head or heart?  xxxv  juan presented in the proper place, to proper placement, every russ credential; and was receiv'd with all the due grimace by those who govern in the mood potential, who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face, thought (what in state affairs is most essential) that they as easily might do the youngster, as hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.  xxxvi  they err'd, as aged men will do; but by and by we'll talk of that; and if we don't, 't will be because our notion is not high of politicians and their double front, who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie: now, what i love in women is, they won't or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it so well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.  xxxvii  and, after all, what is a lie? 'tis but the truth in masquerade; and i defy historians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put a fact without some leaven of a lie. the very shadow of true truth would shut up annals, revelations, poesy, and prophecy—except it should be dated some years before the incidents related.  xxxviii  prais'd be all liars and all lies! who now can tax my mild muse with misanthropy? she rings the world's "te deum," and her brow blushes for those who will not: but to sigh is idle; let us like most others bow, kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty, after the good example of "green erin," whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.  xxxix  don juan was presented, and his dress and mien excited general admiration; i don't know which was more admir'd or less: one monstrous diamond drew much observation, which catherine in a moment of "ivresse" (in love or brandy's fervent fermentation) bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd; and, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.  xl  besides the ministers and underlings, who must be courteous to the accredited diplomatists of rather wavering kings, until their royal riddle's fully read, the very clerks—those somewhat dirty springs of office, or the house of office, fed by foul corruption into streams—even they were hardly rude enough to earn their pay.  xli  and insolence no doubt is what they are employ'd for, since it is their daily labour, in the dear offices of peace or war; and should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour, when for a passport, or some other bar to freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore), if he found not this spawn of tax-born riches, like lap-dogs, the least civil sons of b{-}{-}{-}{-}{-}s.  xlii  but juan was receiv'd with much "empressement" — these phrases of refinement i must borrow from our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman, there is a move set down for joy or sorrow, not only in mere talking, but the press. man in islands is, it seems, downright and thorough, more than on continents—as if the sea (see billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.  xliii  and yet the british "damme" 's rather attic, your continental oaths are but incontinent, and turn on things which no aristocratic spirit would name, and therefore even i won't anent this subject quote; as it would be schismatic in politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't; but "damme" 's quite ethereal, though too daring— platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.  xliv  for downright rudeness, ye may stay at home; for true or false politeness (and scarce that now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam: the first the emblem (rarely though) of what you leave behind, the next of much you come to meet. however, 'tis no time to chat on general topics: poems must confine themselves to unity, like this of mine.  xlv  in the great world—which, being interpreted, meaneth the west or worst end of a city, and about twice two thousand people bred by no means to be very wise or witty, but to sit up while others lie in bed, and look down on the universe with pity— juan, as an inveterate patrician, was well receiv'd by persons of condition.  xlvi  he was a bachelor, which is a matter of import both to virgin and to bride, the former's hymeneal hopes to flatter; and (should she not hold fast by love or pride) 'tis also of some momemt to the latter: a rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's side, requires decorum, and is apt to double the horrid sin—and what's still worse the trouble.  xlvii  but juan was a bachelor—of arts, and parts, and hearts: he danc'd and sung, and had an air as sentimental as mozart's softest of melodies; and could be sad or cheerful, without any "flaws or starts," just at the proper time; and though a lad, had seen the world—which is a curious sight, and very much unlike what people write.  xlviii  fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames bloom'd also in less transitory hues; for both commodities dwell by the thames the painting and the painted; youth, ceruse, against his heart preferr'd their usual claims, such as no gentleman can quite refuse; daughters admir'd his dress, and pious mothers inquir'd his income, and if he had brothers.  xlix  the milliners who furnish "drapery misses" throughout the season, upon speculation of payment ere the honeymoon's last kisses have wan'd into a crescent's coruscation, thought such an opportunity as this is, of a rich foreigner's initiation, not to be overlook'd—and gave such credit, that future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.  l  the blues, that tender tribe, who sigh o'er sonnets, and with the pages of the last review line the interior of their heads or bonnets, advanc'd in all their azure's highest hue: they talk'd bad french or spanish, and upon its late authors ask'd him for a hint or two; and which was softest, russian or castilian? and whether in his travels he saw ilion?  li  juan, who was a little superficial, and not in literature a great drawcansir, examin'd by this learned and especial jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer: his duties warlike, loving or official, his steady application as a dancer, had kept him from the brink of hippocrene, which now he found was blue instead of green.  lii  however, he replied at hazard, with a modest confidence and calm assurance, which lent his learned lucubrations pith, and pass'd for arguments of good endurance. that prodigy, miss araminta smith (who at sixteen translated "hercules furens" into as furious english), with her best look, set down his sayings in her common-place book.  liii  juan knew several languages—as well he might—and brought them up with skill, in time to save his fame with each accomplish'd belle, who still regretted that he did not rhyme. there wanted but this requisite to swell his qualities (with them) into sublime: lady fitz-frisky, and miss m{ae}via mannish, both long'd extremely to be sung in spanish.  liv  however, he did pretty well, and was admitted as an aspirant to all the coteries, and, as in banquo's glass, at great assemblies or in parties small, he saw ten thousand living authors pass, that being about their average numeral; also the eighty "greatest living poets," as every paltry magazine can show it's.  lv  in twice five years the "greatest living poet," like to the champion in the fisty ring, is call'd on to support his claim, or show it, although 'tis an imaginary thing, even i—albeit i'm sure i did not know it, nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king— was reckon'd, a considerable time, the grand napoleon of the realms of rhyme.  lvi  but juan was my moscow, and faliero my leipsic, and my mont saint jean seem cain: "la belle alliance" of dunces down at zero, now that the lion's fall'n, may rise again, but i will fall at least as fell my hero; nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign; or to some lonely isle of jailors go, with turncoat southey for my turnkey lowe.  lvii  sir walter reign'd before me; moore and campbell before and after; but now grown more holy, the muses upon sion's hill must ramble with poets almost clergymen, or wholly; and pegasus has a psalmodic amble beneath the very reverend rowley powley, who shoes the glorious animal with stilts, a modern ancient pistol—"by the hilts!"  lviii  still he excels that artificial hard labourer in the same vineyard, though the vine yields him but vinegar for his reward— that neutralis'd dull dorus of the nine; that swarthy sporus, neither man nor bard; that ox of verse, who ploughs for every line: cambyses' roaring romans beat at least the howling hebrews of cybele's priest.  lix  then there's my gentle euphues, who, they say, sets up for being a sort of moral me; he'll find it rather difficult some day to turn out both, or either, it may be. some persons think that coleridge hath the sway; and wordsworth has supporters, two or three; and that deep-mouth'd boeotian "savage landor" has taken for a swan rogue southey's gander.  lx  john keats, who was kill'd off by one critique, just as he really promis'd something great, if not intelligible, without greek contriv'd to talk about the gods of late, much as they might have been suppos'd to speak. poor fellow! his was an untoward fate; 'tis strange the mind, that very fiery particle, should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.  lxi  the list grows long of live and dead pretenders to that which none will gain—or none will know the conqueror at least; who, ere time renders his last award, will have the long grass grow above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders. if i might augur, i should rate but low their chances; they're too numerous, like the thirty mock tyrants, when rome's annals wax'd but dirty.  lxii  this is the literary lower empire, where the pr{ae}torian bands take up the matter; a "dreadful trade," like his who "gathers samphire," the insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter, with the same feelings as you'd coax a vampire, now, were i once at home, and in good satire, i'd try conclusions with those janizaries, and show them what an intellectual war is.  lxiii  i think i know a trick or two, would turn their flanks; but it is hardly worth my while, with such small gear to give myself concern: indeed i've not the necessary bile; my natural temper's really aught but stern, and even my muse's worst reproof's a smile; and then she drops a brief and modern curtsy, and glides away, assur'd she never hurts ye.  lxiv  my juan, whom i left in deadly peril amongst live poets and blue ladies, pass'd with some small profit through that field so sterile, being tir'd in time, and, neither least nor last, left it before he had been treated very ill; and henceforth found himself more gaily class'd amongst the higher spirits of the day, the sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.  lxv  his morns he pass'd in business—which dissected, was, like all business, a laborious nothing that leads to lassitude, the most infected and centaur-nessus garb of mortal clothing, and on our sofas makes us lie dejected, and talk in tender horrors of our loathing all kinds of toil, save for our country's good— which grows no better, though 'tis time it should.  lxvi  his afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons, lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour in riding round those vegetable puncheons call'd "parks," where there is neither fruit nor flower enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings; but after all it is the only "bower" (in moore's phrase) where the fashionable fair can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.  lxvii  then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world! then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd like harness'd meteors; then along the floor chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd; then roll the brazen thunders of the door, which opens to the thousand happy few an earthly paradise of "or molu."  lxviii  there stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink with the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz, the only dance which teaches girls to think, makes one in love even with its very faults. saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink, and long the latest of arrivals halts, 'midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb, and gain an inch of staircase at a time.  lxix  thrice happy he who, after a survey of the good company, can win a corner, a door that's in or boudoir out of the way, where he may fix himself like small "jack horner," and let the babel round run as it may, and look on as a mourner, or a scorner, or an approver, or a mere spectator, yawning a little as the night grows later.  lxx  but this won't do, save by and by; and he who, like don juan, takes an active share must steer with care through all that glittering sea of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where he deems it is his proper place to be; dissolving in the waltz to some soft air, or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill, where science marshals forth her own quadrille.  lxxi  or, if he dance not, but hath higher views upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride, let him take care that that which he pursues is not at once too palpably descried. full many an eager gentleman oft rues his haste; impatience is a blundering guide amongst a people famous for reflection, who like to play the fool with circumspection.  lxxii  but, if you can contrive, get next at supper; or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle: oh, ye ambrosial moments! always upper in mind, a sort of sentimental bogle, which sits for ever upon memory's crupper, the ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! ill can tender souls relate the rise and fall of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.  lxxiii  but these precautionary hints can touch only the common run, who must pursue, and watch and ward; whose plans a word too much or little overturns; and not the few or many (for the number's sometimes such) whom a good mien, especially if new, or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense or nonsense, permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.  lxxiv  our hero, as a hero young and handsome, noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger, like other slaves of course must pay his ransom before he can escape from so much danger as will environ a conspicuous man. some talk about poetry, and "rack and manger," and ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble— i wish they knew the life of a young noble.  lxxv  they are young, but know not youth—it is anticipated; handsome but wasted, rich without a sou; their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated; their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a jew; both senates see their nightly votes participated between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew; and having voted, din'd, drunk, gam'd and whor'd, the family vault receives another lord.  lxxvi  "where is the world," cries young, "at eighty? where the world in which a man was born?" alas! where is the world of eight years past?'twas there— i look for it—'tis gone, a globe of glass! crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gaz'd on, ere a silent change dissolves the glittering mass. statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings, and dandies—all are gone on the wind's wings.  lxxvii  where is napoleon the grand? god knows: where little castlereagh? the devil can tell: where grattan, curran, sheridan, all those who bound the bar or senate in their spell? where is the unhappy queen, with all her woes? and where the daughter, whom the isles lov'd well? where are those martyr'd saints the five per cents? and where—oh, where the devil are the rents?  lxxviii  where's brummell? dish'd. where's long pole wellesley? diddled. where's whitbread? romilly? where's george the third? where is his will? (that's not so soon unriddled.) and where is "fum" the fourth, our "royal bird"? gone down, it seems, to scotland to be fiddled unto by sawney's violin, we have heard: "caw me, caw thee"—for six months hath been hatching this scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.  lxxix  where is lord this? and where my lady that? the honourable mistresses and misses? some laid aside like an old opera hat, married, unmarried, and remarried (this is an evolution oft perform'd of late). where are the dublin shouts—and london hisses? where are the grenvilles? turn'd as usual. where my friends the whigs? exactly where they were.  lxxx  where are the lady carolines and franceses? divorc'd or doing thereanent. ye annals so brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is, thou morning post, sole record of the panels broken in carriages, and all the phantasies of fashion, say what streams now fill those channels? some die, some fly, some languish on the continent, because the times have hardly left them one tenant.  lxxxi  some who once set their caps at cautious dukes, have taken up at length with younger brothers: some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks: some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers: others have lost their fresh and fairy looks: in short, the list of alterations bothers. there's little strange in this, but something strange is the unusual quickness of these common changes.  lxxxii  talk not of seventy years as age! in seven i have seen more changes, down from monarchs to the humblest individuals under heaven, than might suffice a moderate century through. i knew that nought was lasting, but now even change grows too changeable, without being new: nought's permanent among the human race, except the whigs not getting into place.  lxxxiii  i have seen napoleon, who seem'd quite a jupiter, shrink to a saturn. i have seen a duke (no matter which) turn politician stupider, if that can well be, than his wooden look. but it is time that i should hoist my "blue peter," and sail for a new theme: i have seen—and shook to see it—the king hiss'd, and then caress'd; but don't pretend to settle which was best.  lxxxiv  i have seen the landholders without a rap— i have seen joanna southcote—i have seen the house of commons turn'd to a taxtrap— i have seen that sad affair of the late queen— i have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap— i have seen a congress doing all that's mean— i have seen some nations, like o'erloaded asses, kick off their burthens—meaning the high classes.  lxxxv  i have seen small poets, and great prosers, and interminable—not eternal—speakers— i have seen the funds at war with house and land— i have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers— i have seen the people ridden o'er like sand by slaves on horseback—i have seen malt liquors exchang'd for "thin potations" by john bull— i have seen john half detect himself a fool.  lxxxvi  but "carpe diem," juan, "carpe, carpe!" to-morrow sees another race as gay and transient, and devour'd by the same harpy. "life's a poor player"—then "play out the play, ye villains!" and above all keep a sharp eye much less on what you do than what you say: be hypocritical, be cautious, be not what you seem, but always what you see.  lxxxvii  but how shall i relate in other cantos of what befell our hero in the land, which 'tis the common cry and lie to vaunt as a moral country? but i hold my hand— for i disdain to write an atalantis; but 'tis as well at once to understand, you are not a moral people, and you know it, without the aid of too sincere a poet.  lxxxviii  what juan saw and underwent shall be my topic, with of course the due restriction which is requir'd by proper courtesy; and recollect the work is only fiction, and that i sing of neither mine nor me, though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction, will hint allusions never meant. ne'er doubt this—when i speak, i don't hint, but speak out.  lxxxix  whether he married with the third or fourth offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess, or whether with some virgin of more worth (i mean in fortune's matrimonial bounties), he took to regularly peopling earth, of which your lawful, awful wedlock fount is— or whether he was taken in for damages, for being too excursive in his homages—  xc  is yet within the unread events of time. thus far, go forth, thou lay, which i will back against the same given quantity of rhyme, for being as much the subject of attack as ever yet was any work sublime, by those who love to say that white is black. so much the better!—i may stand alone, but would not change my free thoughts for a throne.

 do you blame me that i loved him? if when standing all alone i cried for bread a careless world pressed to my lips a stone.  do you blame me that i loved him, that my heart beat glad and free, when he told me in the sweetest tones he loved but only me?  can you blame me that i did not see beneath his burning kiss the serpent’s wiles, nor even hear the deadly adder hiss?  can you blame me that my heart grew cold that the tempted, tempter turned; when he was feted and caressed and i was coldly spurned?  would you blame him, when you draw from me your dainty robes aside, if he with gilded baits should claim your fairest as his bride?  would you blame the world if it should press on him a civic crown; and see me struggling in the depth then harshly press me down?  crime has no sex and yet to-day i wear the brand of shame; whilst he amid the gay and proud still bears an honored name.  can you blame me if i’ve learned to think your hate of vice a sham, when you so coldly crushed me down and then excused the man?  would you blame me if to-morrow the coroner should say, a wretched girl, outcast, forlorn, has thrown her life away?  yes, blame me for my downward course, but oh! remember well, within your homes you press the hand that led me down to hell.  i’m glad god’s ways are not our ways, he does not see as man, within his love i know there’s room for those whom others ban.  i think before his great white throne, his throne of spotless light, that whited sepulchres shall wear the hue of endless night.  that i who fell, and he who sinned, shall reap as we have sown; that each the burden of his loss must bear and bear alone.  no golden weights can turn the scale of justice in his sight; and what is wrong in woman’s life in man’s cannot be right.

 1    there are few probabilities through which dreamers do not pass. . .  the first dream is the bright red dream of our mother’s heart. it is her sacrifice of something eternal in herself, for us. the arabs say blood has flowed let us begin again.  the heart is like a cup, or a coffer, or a cave. it holds the image of the sun within us. it is a center of illumination and happiness and wisdom. to dream of the heart is always to dream of the importance of love. . .  the second dream is the inauguration of the soul. in this dream we are confronted by a host of birds. . .  some were guileless like the doves,

 when the fire bell rang its two short, one long electric signal, the boys closest to the wall of windows had to raise the blinds and close the sashes, and then join the last of our line as it snaked out the classroom onto the field of asphalt where we stood, grade-by-grade, until the principal appeared with her gold timex.  we learned early that catastrophe must always be attended in silence, that death prefers us orderly and ordered, and that rules will save us from the chaos of our fear, so that even if we die, we die together, which was the calm almost consoling thought i had each time the yellow c.d. siren wailed and we would tuck ourselves beneath our sturdy desktops.  eyes averted from the windows, we’d wait for the drill to pass or until the nun’s rosary no longer clicked and we could hear her struggling to free herself from the leg-well of her desk, and then her call for us to rise and, like herself, brush off the dust gathered on our clothes. and then the lessons resumed. no thought of how easily we interred ourselves,  though at home each would dream the mushroom cloud, the white cap of apocalypse whose funnel stem sucked glass from windows, air from lungs, and made all these rehearsals the sad and hollow gestures that they were, for we knew it in our bones that we would die, curled in a last defense— head on knees, arms locked around legs— the way i’ve seen it since in nursing homes  and hospices: forms bedsheets can’t hide, as if in death the body takes on the soul’s compact shape, acrobatic, posed to tumble free of the desktop or bed and join the expanse and wide scatter of debris.

 we drive between lakes just turning green; late june. the white turkeys have been moved a second time to new grass. how long the seconds are in great pain! terror just before death, shoulders torn, shot from helicopters. “i saw the boy being tortured with a telephone generator,” the sergeant said. “i felt sorry for him and blew his head off with a shotgun.” these instants become crystals, particles the grass cannot dissolve. our own gaiety will end up in asia, and you will look down in your cup and see black starfighters. our own cities were the ones we wanted to bomb! therefore we will have to go far away to atone for the suffering of the stringy-chested and the short rice-fed ones, quivering in the helicopter like wild animals, shot in the chest, taken back to be questioned.

 (for all children who wondered about the tragic event of april 4, 1968 at memphis.) my children, my children, remember the day when the drum major of freedom's parade went away. stop crying now little children and listen and you will know for the future what really did happen.  you will know why your father was solemn and grim and why mother's eyes were wet at the rim. you will know why the flags flew at half mast and why all the buildings were shut tight and fast.  the drum major was down in memphis that day helping the workers to win a raise in pay when an evil assassin's bullet snuffed his bright young life away.  that's why we were all so saddened that day when the life of the drum major was taken away. who will come forward to stand in his stead? who'll be the drum major in the freedom parade?  my children, our major was such a good man whose life was based on the divine plan. he loved this country, its people black and white and believed that all should be imbued with the right.  that's why we were all so saddened that day when the life of the drum major was taken away. we are looking for someone to stand in his stead we now seek a new leader for the freedom parade.  do you know my children that he bore the brunt, he marched unafraid right up in the front he marched for justice for children like you and a bountier life for your parents too.  that's why we honor martin luther king he tried with love to make liberty ring. he wished everyone in our tortured country to live together in peace and harmony.  that's why we were all so saddened that day when the drum major's life was taken away. do you know someone who can stand in his stead? do you know someone to lead the parade?  i hear you my children. i hear what you said. that you children yourselves would lead his parade that you'll carry the banner of the drum major dear and march on to full freedom without any fear.  our spirits are lifted, our sorrows subside. you children shall lead us with dr. king at your side. you children of freedom will stand in his stead. you children of freedom will lead the parade.  march on my children to his distant drumbeat. march on my children, keep alive his heartbeat. when this peace and freedom is finally won then will martin luther king's work be done.

 bent double, like old beggars under sacks, knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, and towards our distant rest began to trudge. men marched asleep. many had lost their boots, but limped on, blood-shod. all went lame; all blind; drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots of gas-shells dropping softly behind.  gas! gas! quick, boys!—an ecstasy of fumbling fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, but someone still was yelling out and stumbling and flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.— dim through the misty panes and thick green light, as under a green sea, i saw him drowning.  in all my dreams before my helpless sight, he plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.  if in some smothering dreams, you too could pace behind the wagon that we flung him in, and watch the white eyes writhing in his face, his hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin; if you could hear, at every jolt, the blood come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,— my friend, you would not tell with such high zest to children ardent for some desperate glory, the old lie:dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.

 there will be a rusty gun on the wall, sweetheart, the rifle grooves curling with flakes of rust. a spider will make a silver string nest in the darkest, warmest corner of it. the trigger and the range-finder, they too will be rusty. and no hands will polish the gun, and it will hang on the wall. forefingers and thumbs will point casually toward it. it will be spoken among half-forgotten, whished-to-be-forgotten things. they will tell the spider: go on, you're doing good work.

 tell me how you entered this poem, how you even got in here. where my parentals come from is where i’m coming from and where where i’m coming from is from we lock the front door and the back and the side and can’t spare a single extra key. where where i’m coming from is from we shut all the windows tight like our eyes to an ugly view: a jail if i ever saw one, and maybe i did, and maybe that was enough for me. maybe you made the mistake, by coming here. unannounced. uninvited. it takes a lot of talent to step in someone’s crib and be welcomed without any alarms going off, so shake your ass something dangerous if you can, sing me a song real sexy-like or be suck out of luck if i feel like shooting strangers today. if home is where the heart is then four red bullet wounds across the chest of the city’s flag say everything there is about my feelings toward you and the whole damn world right now. because it was my own blood this time and yet i’m still here, and the funny thing about that town and this one is that they both burned down once. and down the hall they’re burning bud and i want some kinda sorta but without the friends. which makes you foe, i suppose, as if you are the presence of all colors and i am the absence of said colors. but maybe i got it backwards, twisted it all up. it just hurts to have my hair pulled even if it’s by my own hand. my mind is spinning blanks inside every chamber; everywhere i turn on the tv they’re shooting boys like what i used to be before i wasn’t anymore and when did that happen? and what am i now? are you the phantom or me, me or none of the above? the last shadow i cast on a sunny sunday stole my wallet and bought this gun and all the rounds and all the rounds at the bar, too. where i’m coming from, when in love: squeeze. when lonely, loan yourself some time and don’t pay it back. beware, because i’m both lonely and in love like the living embodiment of the code switch. i’m polluted air and poisoned water and whatever else they say except when i say i’m not and i’m not one to play for a fool for the record. fear me. i’m godly and i’m just and just get the hell out demon and do come again. come again: it’s my igneous ire toward you that keeps me a live wire, and alive.

 at two thousand feet the sea wrinkles like an old man’s hand. closer, in a monotone of peristalsis, its fugue-like swells create and recreate one image in an idiot concentration.  from horizon to horizon, this desert with the eye athirst for something stable when off to southeast-ward— it was a plane all right, or had been, a shipside fighter, her pontoons floated her. smashed like a match-case, no one could be sure if it were ours or had been one of theirs.  that’s all there was. a thousand miles anywhere there was only the north ocean, the poleward pallor, like a desolation of spirit, lonelier than god. what did it mean? they thought of night fleets in the ghostly boreal dark or maybe toy cardboard silhouettes in the bleak limbo of noon: the salvos wink in bloom at twenty miles, the pause, the roar like a night freight and the near misses building their faery forests.  where were these giants? the sea offered a single clue, a symbol; no explanation. northward the fog banks thickened and on all horizons as if jealous of giving up secured positions the night stirred angrily like an old suspicion.

 i have tried to say that, although love is not judgement analysis too is a style of affect since the scale that rends me vulnerable has cut, from abundance, doubt (not that identity shunts civic ratio or consequence) sure — i would prefer to respond to only the established charms (and forget inconvenience) but her hair was also a kind of honey or instrument.  all that is beautiful, from which i choose even artifice, which i hold above nature won’t salve these stuttered accoutrements  
NEW POEM
 nothing so true as what you once let fall, "most women have no characters at all." matter too soft a lasting mark to bear, and best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair.  how many pictures of one nymph we view, all how unlike each other, all how true! arcadia's countess, here, in ermin'd pride, is, there, pastora by a fountain side. here fannia, leering on her own good man, and there, a naked leda with a swan. let then the fair one beautifully cry, in magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye, or dress'd in smiles of sweet cecilia shine, with simp'ring angels, palms, and harps divine; whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it, if folly grows romantic, i must paint it.  come then, the colours and the ground prepare! dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air; choose a firm cloud, before it fall, and in it catch, ere she change, the cynthia of this minute.  rufa, whose eye quick-glancing o'er the park, attracts each light gay meteor of a spark, agrees as ill with rufa studying locke, as sappho's diamonds with her dirty smock; or sappho at her toilet's greasy task, with sappho fragrant at an ev'ning masque: so morning insects that in muck begun, shine, buzz, and flyblow in the setting sun.  how soft is silia! fearful to offend; the frail one's advocate, the weak one's friend: to her, calista prov'd her conduct nice, and good simplicius asks of her advice. sudden, she storms! she raves! you tip the wink, but spare your censure; silia does not drink. all eyes may see from what the change arose, all eyes may see—a pimple on her nose.  papillia, wedded to her doating spark, sighs for the shades—"how charming is a park!" a park is purchas'd, but the fair he sees all bath'd in tears—"oh, odious, odious trees!"  ladies, like variegated tulips, show, 'tis to their changes that their charms they owe; their happy spots the nice admirer take, fine by defect, and delicately weak. 'twas thus calypso once each heart alarm'd, aw'd without virtue, without beauty charm'd; her tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her eyes, less wit than mimic, more a wit than wise; strange graces still, and stranger flights she had, was just not ugly, and was just not mad; yet ne'er so sure our passion to create, as when she touch'd the brink of all we hate.  narcissa's nature, tolerably mild, to make a wash, would hardly stew a child; has ev'n been prov'd to grant a lover's pray'r, and paid a tradesman once to make him stare, gave alms at easter, in a christian trim, and made a widow happy, for a whim. why then declare good nature is her scorn, when 'tis by that alone she can be borne? why pique all mortals, yet affect a name? a fool to pleasure, yet a slave to fame: now deep in taylor and the book of martyrs now drinking citron with his grace and chartres. now conscience chills her, and now passion burns; and atheism and religion take their turns; a very heathen in the carnal part, yet still a sad, good christian at her heart.  see sin in state, majestically drunk; proud as a peeress, prouder as a punk; chaste to her husband, frank to all beside, a teeming mistress, but a barren bride. what then? let blood and body bear the fault, her head's untouch'd, that noble seat of thought: such this day's doctrine—in another fit she sins with poets through pure love of wit. what has not fir'd her bosom or her brain? caesar and tallboy, charles and charlema'ne. as helluo, late dictator of the feast, the nose of hautgout, and the tip of taste, critiqu'd your wine, and analys'd your meat, yet on plain pudding deign'd at home to eat; so philomede, lect'ring all mankind on the soft passion, and the taste refin'd, th' address, the delicacy—stoops at once, and makes her hearty meal upon a dunce.  flavia's a wit, has too much sense to pray, to toast our wants and wishes, is her way; nor asks of god, but of her stars to give the mighty blessing, "while we live, to live." then all for death, that opiate of the soul! lucretia's dagger, rosamonda's bowl. say, what can cause such impotence of mind? a spark too fickle, or a spouse too kind. wise wretch! with pleasures too refin'd to please; with too much spirit to be e'er at ease; with too much quickness ever to be taught; with too much thinking to have common thought: you purchase pain with all that joy can give, and die of nothing but a rage to live.  turn then from wits; and look on simo's mate, no ass so meek, no ass so obstinate: or her, that owns her faults, but never mends, because she's honest, and the best of friends: or her, whose life the church and scandal share, for ever in a passion, or a prayer: or her, who laughs at hell, but (like her grace) cries, "ah! how charming, if there's no such place!" or who in sweet vicissitude appears of mirth and opium, ratafie and tears, the daily anodyne, and nightly draught, to kill those foes to fair ones, time and thought. woman and fool are two hard things to hit, for true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.  but what are these to great atossa's mind? scarce once herself, by turns all womankind! who, with herself, or others, from her birth finds all her life one warfare upon earth: shines, in exposing knaves, and painting fools, yet is, whate'er she hates and ridicules. no thought advances, but her eddy brain whisks it about, and down it goes again. full sixty years the world has been her trade, the wisest fool much time has ever made. from loveless youth to unrespected age, no passion gratified except her rage. so much the fury still outran the wit, the pleasure miss'd her, and the scandal hit. who breaks with her,-provokes revenge from hell, but he's a bolder man who dares be well. her every turn with violence pursu'd, nor more a storm her hate than gratitude. to that each passion turns, or soon or late; love, if it makes her yield, must make her hate: superiors? death! and equals? what a curse! but an inferior not dependant? worse. offend her, and she knows not to forgive; oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live: but die, and she'll adore you—then the bust and temple rise—then fall again to dust. last night, her lord was all that's good and great; a knave this morning, and his will a cheat. strange! by the means defeated of the ends, by spirit robb'd of pow'r, by warmth of friends, by wealth of follow'rs! without one distress sick of herself through very selfishness! atossa, curs'd with ev'ry granted pray'r, childless with all her children, wants an heir. to heirs unknown descends th' unguarded store, or wanders, heav'n-directed, to the poor.  pictures like these, dear madam, to design, asks no firm hand, and no unerring line; some wand'ring touch or some reflected light, some flying stroke alone can hit 'em right: for how should equal colours do the knack? chameleons who can paint in white and black?  "yet chloe sure was form'd without a spot"— nature in her then err'd not, but forgot. "with ev'ry pleasing, ev'ry prudent part, say, what can chloe want?"—she wants a heart. she speaks, behaves, and acts just as she ought; but never, never, reach'd one gen'rous thought. virtue she finds too painful an endeavour, content to dwell in decencies for ever. so very reasonable, so unmov'd, as never yet to love, or to be lov'd. she, while her lover pants upon her breast, can mark the figures on an indian chest; and when she sees her friend in deep despair, observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair. forbid it heav'n, a favour or a debt she e'er should cancel—but she may forget. safe is your secret still in chloe's ear; but none of chloe's shall you ever hear. of all her dears she never slander'd one, but cares not if a thousand are undone. would chloe know if you're alive or dead? she bids her footman put it in her head. chloe is prudent—would you too be wise? then never break your heart when chloe dies.  one certain portrait may (i grant) be seen, which heav'n has varnish'd out, and made a queen : the same for ever! and describ'd by all with truth and goodness, as with crown and ball. poets heap virtues, painters gems at will, and show their zeal, and hide their want of skill. 'tis well—but, artists! who can paint or write, to draw the naked is your true delight. that robe of quality so struts and swells, none see what parts of nature it conceals. th' exactest traits of body or of mind, we owe to models of an humble kind. if queensbury to strip there's no compelling, 'tis from a handmaid we must take a helen. from peer or bishop 'tis no easy thing to draw the man who loves his god, or king: alas! i copy (or my draught would fail) from honest mah'met, or plain parson hale.  but grant, in public men sometimes are shown, a woman's seen in private life alone: our bolder talents in full light display'd; your virtues open fairest in the shade. bred to disguise, in public 'tis you hide; there, none distinguish twixt your shame or pride, weakness or delicacy; all so nice, that each may seem a virtue, or a vice.  in men, we various ruling passions find; in women, two almost divide the kind; those, only fix'd, they first or last obey, the love of pleasure, and the love of sway. that, nature gives; and where the lesson taught is still to please, can pleasure seem a fault? experience, this; by man's oppression curs'd, they seek the second not to lose the first.  men, some to bus'ness, some to pleasure take; but ev'ry woman is at heart a rake: men, some to quiet, some to public strife; but ev'ry lady would be queen for life.  yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens! pow'r all their end, but beauty all the means. in youth they conquer, with so wild a rage, as leaves them scarce a subject in their age: for foreign glory, foreign joy, they roam; no thought of peace or happiness at home. but wisdom's triumph is well-tim'd retreat, as hard a science to the fair as great! beauties, like tyrants, old and friendless grown, yet hate repose, and dread to be alone, worn out in public, weary ev'ry eye, nor leave one sigh behind them when they die.  pleasures the sex, as children birds, pursue, still out of reach, yet never out of view; sure, if they catch, to spoil the toy at most, to covet flying, and regret when lost: at last, to follies youth could scarce defend, it grows their age's prudence to pretend; asham'd to own they gave delight before, reduc'd to feign it, when they give no more: as hags hold sabbaths, less for joy than spite, so these their merry, miserable night; still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide, and haunt the places where their honour died.  see how the world its veterans rewards! a youth of frolics, an old age of cards; fair to no purpose, artful to no end, young without lovers, old without a friend, a fop their passion, but their prize a sot, alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot!  ah, friend! to dazzle let the vain design, to raise the thought and touch the heart, be thine! that charm shall grow, while what fatigues the ring, flaunts and goes down, an unregarded thing: so when the sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight, all mild ascends the moon's more sober light, serene in virgin modesty she shines, and unobserv'd the glaring orb declines.  oh! blest with temper, whose unclouded ray can make tomorrow cheerful as today; she, who can love a sister's charms, or hear sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear; she, who ne'er answers till a husband cools, or, if she rules him, never shows she rules; charms by accepting, by submitting sways, yet has her humour most, when she obeys; let fops or fortune fly which way they will; disdains all loss of tickets, or codille; spleen, vapours, or smallpox, above them all, and mistress of herself, though china fall.  and yet, believe me, good as well as ill, woman's at best a contradiction still. heav'n, when it strives to polish all it can its last best work, but forms a softer man; picks from each sex, to make the fav'rite blest, your love of pleasure, our desire of rest: blends, in exception to all gen'ral rules, your taste of follies, with our scorn of fools: reserve with frankness, art with truth allied, courage with softness, modesty with pride, fix'd principles, with fancy ever new; shakes all together, and produces—you.  be this a woman's fame: with this unblest, toasts live a scorn, and queens may die a jest. this phoebus promis'd (i forget the year) when those blue eyes first open'd on the sphere; ascendant phoebus watch'd that hour with care, averted half your parents' simple pray'r, and gave you beauty, but denied the pelf which buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself. the gen'rous god, who wit and gold refines, and ripens spirits as he ripens mines, kept dross for duchesses, the world shall know it, to you gave sense, good humour, and a poet.

'tis not enough, taste, judgment, learning, join; in all you speak, let truth and candour shine: that not alone what to your sense is due, all may allow; but seek your friendship too.  be silent always when you doubt your sense; and speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence: some positive, persisting fops we know, who, if once wrong, will needs be always so; but you, with pleasure own your errors past, and make each day a critic on the last.  'tis not enough, your counsel still be true; blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do; men must be taught as if you taught them not; and things unknown proposed as things forgot. without good breeding, truth is disapprov'd; that only makes superior sense belov'd.  be niggards of advice on no pretence; for the worst avarice is that of sense. with mean complacence ne'er betray your trust, nor be so civil as to prove unjust. fear not the anger of the wise to raise; those best can bear reproof, who merit praise.  'twere well might critics still this freedom take, but appius reddens at each word you speak, and stares, tremendous ! with a threatening eye, like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry! fear most to tax an honourable fool, whose right it is, uncensur'd, to be dull; such, without wit, are poets when they please, as without learning they can take degrees. leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires, and flattery to fulsome dedicators, whom, when they praise, the world believes no more, than when they promise to give scribbling o'er. 'tis best sometimes your censure to restrain, and charitably let the dull be vain: your silence there is better than your spite, for who can rail so long as they can write? still humming on, their drowsy course they keep, and lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep. false steps but help them to renew the race, as after stumbling, jades will mend their pace. what crowds of these, impenitently bold, in sounds and jingling syllables grown old, still run on poets, in a raging vein, even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain, strain out the last, dull droppings of their sense, and rhyme with all the rage of impotence!  such shameless bards we have; and yet 'tis true, there are as mad, abandon'd critics too. the bookful blockhead, ignorantly read, with loads of learned lumber in his head, with his own tongue still edifies his ears, and always list'ning to himself appears. all books he reads, and all he reads assails, from dryden's fables down to durfey's tales. with him, most authors steal their works, or buy; garth did not write his own dispensary . name a new play, and he's the poet's friend, nay show'd his faults—but when would poets mend? no place so sacred from such fops is barr'd, nor is paul's church more safe than paul's churchyard: nay, fly to altars; there they'll talk you dead: for fools rush in where angels fear to tread. distrustful sense with modest caution speaks; it still looks home, and short excursions makes; but rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks; and never shock'd, and never turn'd aside, bursts out, resistless, with a thund'ring tide.  but where's the man, who counsel can bestow, still pleas'd to teach, and yet not proud to know? unbias'd, or by favour or by spite; not dully prepossess'd, nor blindly right; though learn'd, well-bred; and though well-bred, sincere; modestly bold, and humanly severe? who to a friend his faults can freely show, and gladly praise the merit of a foe? blest with a taste exact, yet unconfin'd; a knowledge both of books and human kind; gen'rous converse; a soul exempt from pride; and love to praise, with reason on his side?  such once were critics; such the happy few, athens and rome in better ages knew. the mighty stagirite first left the shore, spread all his sails, and durst the deeps explore: he steer'd securely, and discover'd far, led by the light of the mæonian star. poets, a race long unconfin'd and free, still fond and proud of savage liberty, receiv'd his laws; and stood convinc'd 'twas fit, who conquer'd nature, should preside o'er wit.  horace still charms with graceful negligence, and without methods talks us into sense, will, like a friend, familiarly convey the truest notions in the easiest way. he, who supreme in judgment, as in wit, might boldly censure, as he boldly writ, yet judg'd with coolness, though he sung with fire; his precepts teach but what his works inspire. our critics take a contrary extreme, they judge with fury, but they write with fle'me: nor suffers horace more in wrong translations by wits, than critics in as wrong quotations.  see dionysius homer's thoughts refine, and call new beauties forth from ev'ry line! fancy and art in gay petronius please, the scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.  in grave quintilian's copious work we find the justest rules, and clearest method join'd; thus useful arms in magazines we place, all rang'd in order, and dispos'd with grace, but less to please the eye, than arm the hand, still fit for use, and ready at command.  thee, bold longinus! all the nine inspire, and bless their critic with a poet's fire. an ardent judge, who zealous in his trust, with warmth gives sentence, yet is always just; whose own example strengthens all his laws; and is himself that great sublime he draws.  thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd, licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd; learning and rome alike in empire grew, and arts still follow'd where her eagles flew; from the same foes, at last, both felt their doom, and the same age saw learning fall, and rome. with tyranny, then superstition join'd, as that the body, this enslav'd the mind; much was believ'd, but little understood, and to be dull was constru'd to be good; a second deluge learning thus o'er-run, and the monks finish'd what the goths begun.  at length erasmus, that great, injur'd name, (the glory of the priesthood, and the shame!) stemm'd the wild torrent of a barb'rous age, and drove those holy vandals off the stage.  but see! each muse, in leo's golden days, starts from her trance, and trims her wither'd bays! rome's ancient genius, o'er its ruins spread, shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head! then sculpture and her sister-arts revive; stones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live; with sweeter notes each rising temple rung; a raphael painted, and a vida sung. immortal vida! on whose honour'd brow the poet's bays and critic's ivy grow: cremona now shall ever boast thy name, as next in place to mantua, next in fame!  but soon by impious arms from latium chas'd, their ancient bounds the banished muses pass'd; thence arts o'er all the northern world advance; but critic-learning flourish'd most in france. the rules a nation born to serve, obeys, and boileau still in right of horace sways. but we, brave britons, foreign laws despis'd, and kept unconquer'd, and uncivilis'd, fierce for the liberties of wit, and bold, we still defied the romans, as of old. yet some there were, among the sounder few of those who less presum'd, and better knew, who durst assert the juster ancient cause, and here restor'd wit's fundamental laws. such was the muse, whose rules and practice tell "nature's chief master-piece is writing well." such was roscommon—not more learn'd than good, with manners gen'rous as his noble blood; to him the wit of greece and rome was known, and ev'ry author's merit, but his own. such late was walsh—the muse's judge and friend, who justly knew to blame or to commend; to failings mild, but zealous for desert; the clearest head, and the sincerest heart. this humble praise, lamented shade! receive, this praise at least a grateful muse may give: the muse, whose early voice you taught to sing, prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tender wing, (her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise, but in low numbers short excursions tries: content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view, the learn'd reflect on what before they knew: careless of censure, nor too fond of fame, still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame, averse alike to flatter, or offend, not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.

 bartender, make it straight and make it two— one for the you in me and the me in you. now let us put our heads together: one is half enough for malice, sense, or fun.  i know, bartender, yes, i know when the law should wag its tail or rip with fang and claw. when pilate washed his hands, that neat event set for us judges a caesarean precedent.  what i shall tell you now, as man is man, you’ll find in neither bible nor koran. it happened after my return from france at the bar in tony’s lady of romance.  we boys drank pros and cons, sang dixie; and then, the bar a sahara, we pledged to meet again. but lo, on the bar there stood in naked scorn the goddess justice, like september morn.  who blindfolds justice on the courthouse roof while the lawyers weave the sleight-of-hand of proof? i listened, bartender, with my heart and head, as the goddess justice unbandaged her eyes and said:  “to make the world safe for democracy, you lost a leg in flanders fields—oui, oui? to gain the judge’s seat, you twined the noose that swung the negro higher than a goose.”  bartender, who has dotted every i? crossed every t? put legs on every y? therefore, i challenged her: “lay on, macduff, and damned be him who first cries, ‘hold, enough!’”  the boys guffawed, and justice began to laugh like a maniac on a broken phonograph. bartender, make it straight and make it three— one for the negro . . . one for you and me.

 for kwame dawes your scuttled pays floats—fiery—in the ether; blazing, it vomits smudge-smoke. your mind chars black because you yaw—moth-like—too near flames. you douse your dream-scorched brain with slave-sweat rum— the only gold you can own, corroding your liver. your anthem plays to gunfire. when you think about it (when you can breathe)— after all the lies that frame nostalgia, all the dead faces that occupy photographs, all the slain lovers pitched into ditches, your eyes itch and ache with water, then dry— curling like dead leaves, starving for gold fire.

 we traveled down to see your house, tor house, hawk tower, in carmel, california. it was not quite what i thought it would be: i wanted it to be on a hill, with a view of the ocean unobstructed by other dwellings. fifty years ago i know you had a clean walk to the sea, hopping from boulder to boulder, the various seafowl rightly impressed with your lean, stern face. but today  with our cameras cocked we had to sneak and crawl through trimmed lawns to even verify the identity of your strange carbuncular creation, now rented to trillionaire non- literary folk from pasadena. edged in on all sides by trilevel pasteboard phantasms, it took a pair of good glasses to barely see some newlyweds feed popcorn to an albatross. man is   a puny thing, divorced, whether he knows it or not, and pays his monthly alimony, his child-support. year after year you strolled down to this exceptionally violent shore and chose your boulder; the arms grew as the house grew as the mind grew to exist outside of time, beyond the dalliance of your fellows. today i hate carmel: i seek libation in the tiki  bar: naked native ladies are painted in iridescent orange on velvet cloth: the whole town loves art. and i donate this singapore sling to the memory of it, and join the stream of idlers simmering outside. much as hawks circled your head when you cut stone all afternoon, kids with funny hats on motorscooters keep circling the block. jeffers, ...

 a telephone line goes cold; birds tread it wherever it goes. a farm back of a great plain tugs an end of the line.  i call that farm every year, ringing it, listening, still; no one is home at the farm, the line gives only a hum.  some year i will ring the line on a night at last the right one, and with an eye tapered for braille from the phone on the wall  i will see the tenant who waits— the last one left at the place; through the dark my braille eye will lovingly touch his face.  “hello, is mother at home?” no one is home today. “but father—he should be there.” no one—no one is here.  “but you—are you the one . . . ?” then the line will be gone because both ends will be home: no space, no birds, no farm.  my self will be the plain, wise as winter is gray, pure as cold posts go pacing toward what i know.

 three summers since i chose a maid, too young maybe—but more’s to do at harvest-time than bide and woo. when us was wed she turned afraid of love and me and all things human; like the shut of a winter’s day her smile went out, and ’twadn’t a woman— more like a little frightened fay. one night, in the fall, she runned away.  “out ’mong the sheep, her be,” they said, ’should properly have been abed; but sure enough she wadn’t there lying awake with her wide brown stare. so over seven-acre field and up-along across the down we chased her, flying like a hare before out lanterns. to church-town all in a shiver and a scare we caught her, fetched her home at last and turned the key upon her, fast.  she does the work about the house as well as most, but like a mouse: happy enough to chat and play with birds and rabbits and such as they, so long as men-folk keep away. “not near, not near!” her eyes beseech when one of us comes within reach. the women say that beasts in stall look round like children at her call. i’ve hardly heard her speak at all.  shy as a leveret, swift as he, straight and slight as a young larch tree, sweet as the first wild violets, she, to her wild self. but what to me?  the short days shorten and the oaks are brown, the blue smoke rises to the low grey sky, one leaf in the still air falls slowly down, a magpie’s spotted feathers lie on the black earth spread white with rime, the berries redden up to christmas-time. what’s christmas-time without there be some other in the house than we!  she sleeps up in the attic there alone, poor maid. ’tis but a stair betwixt us. oh! my god! the down, the soft young down of her, the brown, the brown of her—her eyes, her hair, her hair!

NEW POEM
 [sarouk]  we buy what we cannot control, the rugs, rhythm-makers, containing refrains of the oldest story: a man takes a journey. i have no stories inside me, he says, so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet of blue constellations, star patterns at the edges of disordered border walls. at the center, a meditative medallion makes a moving immortal-flowered ground: to live there is to give oneself over to greenness, redness, occasional blues, holding those spirits of woollen dyes rising from the knots within to breathe against the woven, multi-colored air.   [bidjar]  now there is a coat of many colors hung around the wanderer's shoulders where he climbs out from that pit, down which he flung himself, or was thrown into. reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds the dusts of centuries residing there beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers passing, wearing thin, fighting about how best to articulate the names of gods for whom they yearn—accursed by wars' helmet curves, shields, chained stitches of unmediated reds and yellowed husks of blood—broken lines marking a garden in whose precincts his journey began.   [kazak]  three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies through golden latchhooks, surrounding cloudbanks; three eagles, darting within their shifting images: they return him to streets of lit porches in summer dark, a boy stuttering over random syllables, a blindfolded man pleading for his life— whose fate is in the hands of some men whose fate is in the hands of other men, whose fate . . . until the whole pattern emerges, and the language becomes clear. on the floor lies his mother, moaning, until he comes out, guilty, before her— amid the mud of his own frozen blood.   [shirvan]  to live inside such squares as the weaver of this green, becoming golden, labor; to pull back old skins and try to emerge, victorious, from that old prison after so many years, is to find a path back to harmonious designs, surely centered on the search—yet still speaking of a life with knotted figures seen as suffering variations on themes that can be inferred from small vibrations of weft and warp, the ‘snakes' within the threads worn down to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms writhing in a loom of days: those humming ancient instruments whose music seems   [shiraz]  raw as colors governed by the earth, pink as brick, or deserts scraped from rock, rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting down the slopes of the central plateaus to fresh respites from thinner regions of dessication fixed at the fringes below. these lands lie under the ache of desire, which calls feet out to play upon sand, to fill each new hollow, and dance about, tongues turning on the knots of umber, ochre, woven into those undulating waves others might summon in flowery manners to escape from bitter orange, still held by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple   [kerman]  empowering all those who try to hold on— as all things will hold to themselves an idea of themselves—to an aspiration towards good fortune, unwavering even unto death. yet here are dusky passages, canopies of clearness, an everlasting understanding of the earth as cancerous points of coloration, acid starbursts, or dangerous blots—all blurring the way to move past sight: perspectives lost and found again, symmetrical, surrounded by the momentos one saves from travel, old friends, like hues that may betoken, in hopefulness, some changes of heart.   [senneh]  this creates a powerful language about how to levitate a plane—for even as the occasional murmurs of new machines are heard in the land, as old cyclic gardens arrange themselves in the whorls and tendrils throughout tilled fields, snakes hold up this world in variations of light blue skies above temptation. even when an illiterate weaver mistakes an old date for the design, then dyes and binds strange numbers into a ground, the change of the serif, for instance, in a calligraphy of days marks the date of cartouches as mysterious, unknown.   [kashan]  yet the signals from the borders suggest a different tale: lozenges are bottles strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads, shaped like a woman found lying along the side of those same roads—the figure of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly back on itself—as a web of years frames a dying kind of certitude, innocence. the birds in these cages signify singing, as the tapestries of perfected threads suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries to the indeterminancy of all creation:  and we can buy it yet, articulate or not, with each new freeing of our hearts.

 oh, but it is dirty! —this little filling station, oil-soaked, oil-permeated to a disturbing, over-all black translucency. be careful with that match!  father wears a dirty, oil-soaked monkey suit that cuts him under the arms, and several quick and saucy and greasy sons assist him (it’s a family filling station), all quite thoroughly dirty.  do they live in the station? it has a cement porch behind the pumps, and on it a set of crushed and grease- impregnated wickerwork; on the wicker sofa a dirty dog, quite comfy.  some comic books provide the only note of color— of certain color. they lie upon a big dim doily draping a taboret (part of the set), beside a big hirsute begonia.  why the extraneous plant? why the taboret? why, oh why, the doily? (embroidered in daisy stitch with marguerites, i think, and heavy with gray crochet.)  somebody embroidered the doily. somebody waters the plant, or oils it, maybe. somebody arranges the rows of cans so that they softly say: esso—so—so—so  to high-strung automobiles. somebody loves us all.

 aluminum tank indifferent in its place  behind a glass door in the passageway,  like a tea urn in a museum case;  screaming-machines that dumbly spend each day  waiting for gas or smoke or hands or heat,  positioned like beige land mines overhead,  sanguine on walls, or posted on the street  like dwarf grandfather clocks spray painted red;  little gray hydrant in its warlike stance;  old fire escape, all-weather paint job peeling,  a shelf for threadbare rugs and yellowing plants;  sprinkler heads, blooming from the public ceiling;  all sitting supernaturally still,  waiting for us to cry out. and we will.

 such a long time as the wave idling gathers lofts and presses forward into the curvature of the height before one realizes that the  tension completes itself with a fall through air, disorganization the prelude to the meandering of another gather and hurl, the necessary:  ah, what can one make to absorb the astonishment: you should have seen me the merchant at market this morning: the people ogled me with severe  goggles: maids, buying in manners and measures beyond themselves, stared into my goods and then grew horror-eyed: wives still as distant  from day as a carrot from dinner took the misconnection sagely, a usual patience: peashells, i said, long silky peashells: cobs,  i said, long cobs: husks and shucks, i said: one concerned person pointed out that my whole economy was wrong; yes, i said, but i have  nothing else to sell: and i said to her, won't you appreciate the silky beds where seeds have lain: she had not come to that: and  how about this residence all the grains have left: won't you buy it and think about it: not for dinner, she said: rinds, i cried,  rinds and peelings: there was some interest in those, as for a marmalade, but no one willing, finally, to do the preparations: absurd, one  woman shouted, and then i grew serious: can you do with that: but she was off before we fully met: you should have seen me the merchant at  market this morning: will bankruptcy make a go of it: will the leavings be left only: the wave turns over and does not rise again, that wave.

 they’re tipping their battered derbies and striding forward in step for a change, chipper, self-assured, their cardboard suitcases labeled guest of steerage. they’ve just arrived at the boot camp of the good old french foreign legion which they’ve chosen as their slice of life instead of drowning themselves. once again they’re about to become their own mothers and fathers and their own unknowable children who will rehearse sad laughter and mock tears, will frown with completely unsuccessful concentration, and will practice the amazement of suddenly understanding everything that baffles them and will go on baffling them while they pretend they’re only one reel away from belonging in the world. their arrival will mark a new beginning of meaningless hostilities with a slaphappy ending. in a moment, they’ll hear music, and as if they’d known all along this was what they’d come for, they’ll put down the mops and buckets given them as charms with which to cleanse the sahara and move their feet with a calm, sure, delicate disregard for all close-order drill and begin dancing.

 all you violated ones with gentle hearts; you violent dreamers whose cries shout heartbreak; whose voices echo clamors of our cool capers, and whose black faces have hollowed pits for eyes. all you gambling sons and hooked children and bowery bums hating white devils and black bourgeoisie, thumbing your noses at your burning red suns, gather round this coffin and mourn your dying swan.  snow-white moslem head-dress around a dead black face! beautiful were your sand-papering words against our skins! our blood and water pour from your flowing wounds. you have cut open our breasts and dug scalpels in our brains. when and where will another come to take your holy place? old man mumbling in his dotage, crying child, unborn?

 is this mountain all rock, or are there any villages on it? these are some of the things i said to her.  we bake because it is a way of overcoming. in the journey of zest, i see myself.  on the news every day people are standing up screaming or lying down screaming while others remain calm.  she pointed out that i had not made eye contact with her at all. then i cried properly in a short burst.  this is the worst example of any circumstance ever, noted a journalist in his notebook.  let butter and chocolate be a wish not to die! i implored the bain-marie. she likened me to a sieve.  i clutch all my poems to my chest and count them again and again. i am kneeling like a small dog.  what’s going on with this modern world and the right wife not even knowing  what the left wife is doing? now all you have to do is cut off the legs. after an absence, after a hard task,  after the way the hand turns, like this — there was so much i couldn’t contain.  she asked me how i was feeling in my body at this moment; i said tense in my whole trunk area.  a strong smell of white wine. she said it came from an impulse that she often used to have when she first  started practicing. she said she believed feelings are held in the body. she asked me what was going on  with my breath and i realized i was sort of holding it. like the boxes in the cupboard. “enough” can get bigger.  how much bigger, though? when i say i’ve had enough, how will you know when to stop?

 myths of the landscape— the sun going down in the mouths of the furnaces, the fires banked and cooling, ticking into dark, here and there the sudden flaring into roses, then the light across the long factory of the field, the split and rusted castings, across the low slant tin roofs of the buildings, across fallow and tar and burnt potato ground. . . . everything a little still on fire, in sunlight, then smoke, then cinder, then the milling back to earth, rich earth, the silica of ash. the times i can taste the iron in the air, the gray wash like exhaust, smell the burn-off, my eyes begin to tear, and i'm leaning against a wall, short of breath, my heart as large as my father's, alone in such poverty my body scars the light. arable fields, waste and stony places, waysides— the day he got the job at the wellbaum and company foundry he wept, and later, in the truck, pulled the plug on a bottle. in the metallurgy of ore and coal and limestone, in the conversion of the green world to gray, in the face of the blue-white fires, i remember the fencerow, the white campion, calyx and coronal scales, the hawthorns, cut to the size of hedge, the haws so deep in the blood of the season they bled. the year we were poor enough to dig potatoes we had to drive there, then wait for the men to leave who let fires go out. there'd be one good hour of daylight, the rough straight rows running into shade. we'd work the ground until the sun was a single line. i can see my father, now cut in half by the horizon, coming toward me, both arms weighted down. i can see him bending over, gone. later, in the summer, i'd have painted the dead rust undulant sides of all the buildings aluminum, which in the morning threw a glare like water on the garden.

 the body, bearing something ordinary as light                           opens as in a room somewhere the friend opens in poppy, in flame, burns &amp; bears the child — out.  when i did it was the hours &amp; hours of breaking. the bucking of it all, the push &amp; head  not moving, not an inch until, when he flew from me, it was the night who came  flying through me with all its hair, the immense terror of his face &amp; noise.  i heard the stranger &amp; my brain, without looking, vowed a love-him vow. his struggling, merely, to be  split me down, with the axe, to two. how true, the thinness of our hovering between the realms of here, not here.  the fight, first, to open, then to breathe, &amp; then to close. each of us entering the world  &amp; entering the world like this. soft. unlikely.      then —  the idiosyncratic minds &amp; verbs. beloveds, making your ways  to &amp; away from us, always, across the centuries, inside the vastness of the galaxy, how improbable it is that this  iteration  of you or you or me might come to be at all — body of fear, body of laughing — &amp; even last a second. this fact should make us fall all  to our knees with awe, the beauty of it against these odds,  the stacks &amp; stacks of near misses &amp; slimmest chances that birthed one ancestor into the next &amp; next.  profound, unspeakable cruelty who counters this, who does not see.  &amp; so to tenderness i add my action.

 these are the lines on which a committee is formed. almost as soon as work was begun in the tunnel men began to die among dry drills. no masks. most of them were not from this valley. the freights brought many every day from states all up and down the atlantic seaboard and as far inland as kentucky, ohio. after the work the camps were closed or burned. the ambulance was going day and night, white’s undertaking business thriving and his mother’s cornfield put to a new use. “many of the shareholders at this meeting “were nervous about the division of the profits; “how much has the company spent on lawsuits? “the man said $150,000. special counsel: “i am familiar with the case. not   :   one    :    cent. “ ‘terms of the contract. master liable.’ “no reply. great corporation disowning men who made. . . .” after the lawsuits had been instituted. . . . the committee is a true reflection of the will of the people. every man is ill. the women are not affected, this is not a contagious disease. a medical commission, dr. hughes, dr. hayhurst examined the chest of raymond johnson, and dr. harless, a former company doctor. but he saw too many die, he has written his letter to washington. the committee meets regularly, wherever it can. here are mrs. jones, three lost sons, husband sick, mrs. leek, cook for the bus cafeteria, the men: george robinson, leader and voice, four other negroes (three drills, one camp-boy) blankenship, the thin friendly man, peyton the engineer, juanita absent, the one outsider member. here in the noise, loud belts of the shoe-repair shop, meeting around the stove beneath the one bulb hanging. they come late in the day. many come with them who pack the hall, wait in the thorough dark. this is a defense committee. unfinished business: two rounds of lawsuits, 200 cases now as to the crooked lawyers if the men had worn masks, their use would have involved time every hour to wash the sponge at mouth. tunnel, 3⅛ miles long. much larger than the holland tunnel or pittsburgh’s liberty tubes. total cost, say, $16,000,000. this is the procedure of such a committee: to consider the bill before the senate. to discuss relief. active members may be cut off relief, 16-mile walk to fayetteville for cheque— west virginia relief administration, #22991 to joe henigan, gauley bridge, one and 50/100, winona national bank. paid from state funds.

 i'm in a plane that will not be flown into a building. it's a saab 340, seats 40, has two engines with propellers is why i think of beanies, those hats that would spin a young head into the clouds. the plane is red and loud inside like it must be loud in the heart, red like fire and fire engines and the woman two seats up and to the right resembles one of the widows i saw on tv after the towers came down. it's her hair that i recognize, the fecundity of it and the color and its obedience to an ideal, the shape it was asked several hours ago to hold and has held, a kind of wave that begins at the forehead and repeats with slight variations all the way to the tips, as if she were water and a pebble had been continuously dropped into the mouth of her existence. we are eighteen thousand feet over america. people are typing at their laps, blowing across the fog of coffee, sleeping with their heads on the windows, on the pattern of green fields and brown fields, streams and gas stations and swimming pools, blue dots of aquamarine that suggest we've domesticated the mirage. we had to kill someone, i believe, when the metal bones burned and the top fell through the bottom and a cloud made of dust and memos and skin muscled across manhattan. i remember feeling i could finally touch a rifle, that some murders are an illumination of ethics, that they act as a word, a motion the brain requires for which there is no syllable, no breath. the moment the planes had stopped, when we were afraid of the sky, there was a pause when we could have been perfectly american, could have spent infinity dollars and thrown a million bodies at finding the few, lasering our revenge into a kind of love, the blood-hunger kept exact and more convincing for its precision, an expression of our belief that proximity is never the measure of guilt. we've lived in the sky again for some years and today on my lap these pictures from iraq, naked bodies stacked into a pyramid of ha-ha and the articles about broomsticks up the ass and the limbs of children turned into stubble, we are punch-drunk and getting even with the sand, with the map, with oil, with ourselves i think listening to the guys behind me. there's a problem in alpena with an inventory control system, some switches are being counted twice, switches for what i don't know— switches of humor, of faith—but the men are musical in their jargon, both likely born in new delhi and probably americans now, which is what the flesh of this country has been, a grafted pulse, an inventory of the world, and just as the idea of embrace moves chemically into my blood, and i'm warmed as if i've just taken a drink, a voice announces we've begun our descent, and then i sense the falling.

 you were my gym buddy ferreting along spotty florescent ramps. misbegotten signals blinked out bumpkin lanes over sable grass.  we passed through many things. peach sirens, entryway orderlies. mangled disposition-stations. chief in disbelief was concrete love.  firmer still, a melee awkwardness that showed all registrants just how we managed to pickpocket night. then came dark crowds.  some doodled for the pad, debriefed what pumiced eyes meant in multi-dotted foreign rows. buildings like a spider’s clothes.  later, we sped backward. a maw orchard, windless in the mind, boomed electronic lifts. i spied you at the prow of some sensation.  i declined to call another name. pelting noise flew off fairy citadels. clocks, first thought abducted, were switched. dialogues dispelled.  my love heard a mug crash on the countertop of long island sound. our people became as ones lost. not many rebounded with pledge,  not many fetched familiars, stretched legs, reread white meetings. o stream, ring your ears. handsome tubers, go ahead and wig out.  modern territories click like a mouse. body becomes human body. on a skinny avenue i hushed up pyramidal steps older than sorcery.  you know how i want to share a dust ball with misty partner. dance one fabled evening and hear the skylark do something.  picnics bended over, they happen below. swings parks rung. i inject chlorine into my memory-parts with lady satisfaction.  are you gay? a political campaign sanctioned a quart of moose. so stars soon quarreled back to the travel section of the north.  i ignored that and opened my lips for a job to crunch and push at me, seeing the flat spacey wherewithal of disconnected items.  i want a second act. what can i say but this was my second act. must wrangle a look-see. the sign revenging its timely laziness  in the ruffled strut of an accusing pillow. i hibernate in phrase as perfect as the mood of the blue lotus flower. public aspects.  the last shipment of vhs tapes left its factory on this day in 2008 or 2009. meanwhile, delis around town don’t go like they used to.  who cares if i can’t hose you down my you, my newfoundland. and george washington, someone we can’t really know, rows  over famed waters, wondering what his face will be, not in the future, not for the monthly book clubs. but as sovereign:  as beast with dunce cap. i will dress you down in fresh lettuce and gobble your ear off with smutty keys principled as music.  the marching saints won’t bother in battalion to much know. we make of him so much hackneyed affection, dress wounds  as if equivocal all need. hunger passes through to the other side. entertaining pals you wouldn’t call but couldn’t not think to.  a disfigured face’s humiliated psychic debris sprawls on gussy rug. it talks you into needing solace while cup passes from sleep to sleep.  the positional plot warps but is the same. the deluxe mattress drifts on gravitational subtleties like the rest of us, practicing the gut’s banjo.  no, in fact, i don’t know how he ever crossed the channels or canals from that stout city. i don’t really know if i ever really need to know.  one thing we share is worshipping the image of a person we never knew.

 thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an after dinner sleep dreaming of both. here i am, an old man in a dry month, being read to by a boy, waiting for rain. i was neither at the hot gates nor fought in the warm rain nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass, bitten by flies, fought. my house is a decayed house, and the jew squats on the window sill, the owner, spawned in some estaminet of antwerp, blistered in brussels, patched and peeled in london. the goat coughs at night in the field overhead; rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds. the woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea, sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter. i an old man, a dull head among windy spaces.  signs are taken for wonders.  ‘we would see a sign!’ the word within a word, unable to speak a word, swaddled with darkness.  in the juvescence of the year came christ the tiger  in depraved may, dogwood and chestnut, flowering judas, to be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk among whispers; by mr. silvero with caressing hands, at limoges who walked all night in the next room;  by hakagawa, bowing among the titians; by madame de tornquist, in the dark room shifting the candles; fräulein von kulp who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. vacant shuttles weave the wind.  i have no ghosts, an old man in a draughty house under a windy knob.  after such knowledge, what forgiveness? think now history has many cunning passages, contrived corridors and issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, guides us by vanities.  think now she gives when our attention is distracted and what she gives, gives with such supple confusions that the giving famishes the craving.  gives too late what’s not believed in, or is still believed, in memory only, reconsidered passion.  gives too soon into weak hands, what’s thought can be dispensed with till the refusal propagates a fear.  think neither fear nor courage saves us.  unnatural vices are fathered by our heroism.  virtues are forced upon us by our impudent crimes. these tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.  the tiger springs in the new year.  us he devours.  think at last we have not reached conclusion, when i stiffen in a rented house.  think at last i have not made this show purposelessly and it is not by any concitation of the backward devils. i would meet you upon this honestly. i that was near your heart was removed therefrom to lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition. i have lost my passion: why should i need to keep it since what is kept must be adulterated? i have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch: how should i use it for your closer contact?  these with a thousand small deliberations protract the profit of their chilled delirium, excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled, with pungent sauces, multiply variety in a wilderness of mirrors.  what will the spider do suspend its operations, will the weevil delay?  de bailhache, fresca, mrs. cammel, whirled beyond the circuit of the shuddering bear in fractured atoms. gull against the wind, in the windy straits of belle isle, or running on the horn, white feathers in the snow, the gulf claims, and an old man driven by the trades to a sleepy corner.  tenants of the house, thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

 isabella whitney , the maner of her wyll, 1573  1  we’re told it was mostly the soul at stake, its formal  setting-forth, as over water, where, against all odds,  the words-on-paper make a sort of currency, which heaven,  against all odds, accepts. so will, which is to say,may what  i purpose, please, this once, and what will happen coincide.  to which the worldly dispositions were mere after-thought:  your mother’s ring and so forth. what the law considered yours  to give. which in the case of women was restricted—this was  long ago, and elsewhere—so that one confessedly “weak  of purse” might all the more emphatically be thought of as having little  to say. except about the soul. the late disturbance in religion  having done that much, the each for each responsible, even a servant,  even the poor. wild, then—quite beyond the pale—to hustle  the soul-part so hastily off the page. and turn, our isabella whitney,  to the city and its faithlessness. whose smells and sounds—the hawker’s cry,  the drainage ditch in smithfield—all the thick-laid, lovely, in-your-face-and-nostrils stuff  of getting-by no woman of even the slightest affectation would profess to know,  much less to know so well. as one would know the special places on  his body, were the passion merely personal.   2  wattle and brickwork. marble and mud. the city’s vast tautology. no city  without people and no people but will long for what the city says they lack:  high ceilings, gloves and laces, news, the hearth-lit circle of friendship, space  for solitude, enough to eat. and something like a foothold in the whole-of-it,  some without-which-not, some little but needful part in all the passing-  from-hand-to-hand of it, so every time the bondsman racks his debtor or  the shoemaker hammers a nail or one un- practiced girl imagines she  has prompted a look of wistfulness, a piece of it is yours because  your seeing it has made it that much slower to rejoin the blank  oblivion of never-having- been. the year was fifteen hundred seventy-  three. the year of our redeemer, as they used to say. that other  circuit of always-in-your- debt. from which she wrested, in her open  i-am-writing-not-for-fun-but-for-the-money way of authorship, a world  not just of plenty but—and here’s the part of that’s legacy—of love.

 surfeit of distance and the wracked mind waiting, nipping at itself, snarling inwardly at strangers. if i had a car in this town i'd rig it up with a rear bumper horn, something to blast back at the jackasses who honk the second the light turns green. if you could gather up all the hornhonks of just one day in new york city, tie them together in a big brassy knot high above the city and honk them all at once it would shiver the skyscrapers to nothingness, as if they were made of sand, and usher in the second coming. christ would descend from the sky wincing with his fingers in his ears and judge us all insane. who'd want people like us up there yelling at each other, trashing the cloudy, angelic streets with our candywrappers and newspapers and coffeecups? besides, we'd still be waiting for the next thing to happen in heaven, the next violin concerto or cotton candy festival or breathtaking vista to open beneath our feet, and thinking this place isn't quite what it's cracked up to be, and why in hell does everybody want to get here? we'd still be waiting for someone else to come and make us happy, staring through whatever's in front of us, cursing the light that never seems to change.

 sleep to sleep through thirty years of night, a child herself with child, for whom we searched  through here, or there, amidst bones still sleeved and trousered, a spine picked clean, a paint can, a skull with hair   sewn into the hem of memory: fire. god of abraham,god of isaac,god of jacob, god not of philosophers or scholars. god not of poets.   night to night: child walking toward me through burning maize over the clean bones of those whose flesh was lifted by zopilotes into heaven.  so that is how we ascend! in the clawed feet of fallen angels. to be assembled again in the work rooms of clouds.   she rose from where they found her lying not far from a water urn, leaving herself behind on the ground where they found her, holding her arms before her as if she were asleep.  that is how she appears to me: a ghost in heaven. carrying her arms in her arms.   blue smoke from corn cribs, flap of wings. on the walls of the city streets a plague of initials.   walking through a fire-lit river to a burning house: dead singer sewing machine and piece of dress.  outside a cashew tree wept blackened cashews over lamina.  outside paper fireflies rose to the stars.   bring penicillin if you can, surgical tape, a whetstone, mosquito repellent but not the aerosol kind. especially bring a syringe for sucking phlegm, a knife, wooden sticks, a surgical clamp, and plastic bags.  you will need a bottle of cloud for anesthesia.  like the flight of a crane through colorless dreams.   when a leech opens your flesh it leaves a small volcano. always pour turpentine over your hair before going to sleep.   such experiences as these are forgotten before memory intrudes.  the girl was found (don’t say this) with a man’s severed head stuffed into her where a child would have been. no one knew who the man was. another of the dead. so they had not, after all, killed a pregnant girl. this was a relief to them.   that sound in the brush? a settling of wind in sorghum.  if they capture you, talk. talk. please yes. you heard me right the first time.  you will be asked who you are. eventually, we are all asked who we are.  all who come all who come into the world all who come into the world are sent. open your curtain of spirit.

 when i got the box home from the gun shop, i let it sit on my kitchen table in its wax wrapping for hours before i opened it.  safe from the elements. protected from rust and more esoteric forms of corrosion.  my father gave me a rosewood chess set when i turned twelve. i’d never felt so loved through and through, almost literally, as if  i were transparent —  and it probably wasn’t love, just a lucky, last-minute guess at the toy store, which is probably what most love is, anyway.  i took the set into my room, shut the door, determined to master every fork and zugzwang,  that strange position where you’d be safe if only you didn’t have to make a move.  now i’d given myself a perfect gift. i imagined the gun at rest in a velvet sack next to its dainty box of   bullets. i wouldn’t need many.  and no sequined wrapping paper could have been more beautiful than the brown waxed sheet the clerk had unrolled  and cut along the steel edge in one long, smooth stroke. when i finally slit through the layers to open it,  the paper was as delicate and rich as sheets of pastry in baklava, with a mass of dark chocolate in the center.  i’d never touched a gun. i loved how perfectly its handle fit my hand: centuries of engineering and design  coming together in the “unit,” and i knew it would work. unlike toys, religious rituals, erotic techniques, and works of art,  i could depend on it. the only other device i own that fulfills its function so well is my reading glasses,  and i used a soft gray cloth just like the one i clean them with to wipe the oil from my fingertips  as i dropped the bullets one by one into the somber chambers. i just need to know it’s there,  like the extra purse i keep hidden in the closet with a money clip and a neatly folded change of clothes.  i don’t need a class in safety or marksmanship. if i ever use it, it will be at close range.  it may be the only way to get rid of the stranger inside. it may be the only way  to get inside someone i love when every other route has been systematically barred.

 where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; where knowledge is free; where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls; where words come out from the depth of truth; where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection; where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit; where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.  
NEW POEM
 if the hope of giving is to love the living, the giver risks madness in the act of giving.  some such lesson i seemed to see in the faces that surrounded me.  needy and blind, unhopeful, unlifted, what gift would give them the gift to be gifted? the giver is no less adrift than those who are clamouring for the gift.  if they cannot claim it, if it is not there, if their empty fingers beat the empty air and the giver goes down on his knees in prayer knows that all of his giving has been for naught and that nothing was ever what he thought and turns in his guilty bed to stare at the starving multitudes standing there and rises from bed to curse at heaven, he must yet understand that to whom much is given much will be taken, and justly so: i cannot tell how much i owe.

 i  i can hear little clicks inside my dream. night drips its silver tap down the back. at 4 a.m. i wake. thinking  of the man who left in september. his name was law.  my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it. i rinse the face and return to bed. tomorrow i am going to visit my mother.   she  she lives on a moor in the north. she lives alone. spring opens like a blade there. i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books—  some for my mother, some for me including the collected works of emily brontë. this is my favourite author.  also my main fear, which i mean to confront. whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily brontë,  my lonely life around me like a moor, my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door. what meat is it, emily, we need?    three  three silent women at the kitchen table. my mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor, paralyzed with ice. it extends as far as the eye can see  over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky. mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully. the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps  once a minute over the twelve. i have emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother.  a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside. my mother is studying her lettuce. i turn to p. 217.  “in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway. . . .”  it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass. now and then a remark trails through the glass. taxes on the back lot. not a good melon,  too early for melons. hairdresser in town found god, closes shop every tuesday. mice in the teatowel drawer again. little pellets. chew off  the corners of the napkins, if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays. rain tonight.  rain tomorrow. that volcano in the philippines at it again. what’s her name anderson died no not shirley  the opera singer. negress. cancer. not eating your garnish, you don’t like pimento?  out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth. at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a depression, the ice has begun to unclench. black open water comes  curdling up like anger. my mother speaks suddenly. that psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it? you aren’t getting over him.  my mother has a way of summing things up. she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life.  well he’s a taker and you’re a giver i hope it works out, was all she said after she met him. give and take were just words to me  at the time. i had not been in love before. it was like a wheel rolling downhill. but early this morning while mother slept  and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in! come in! to the ghost of his heart’s darling,  i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too. she knows how to hang puppies, that emily.  it isn’t like taking an aspirin you know, i answer feebly. dr. haw says grief is a long process. she frowns. what does it accomplish  all that raking up the past? oh—i spread my hands— i prevail! i look her in the eye. she grins. yes you do.   whacher  whacher, emily’s habitual spelling of this word, has caused confusion. for example  in the first line of the poem printed tell me, whether, is it winter? in the shakespeare head edition. but whacher is what she wrote.  whacher is what she was. she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night. she whached eyes, stars, inside, outside, actual weather.  she whached the bars of time, which broke. she whached the poor core of the world, wide open.  to be a whacher is not a choice. there is nowhere to get away from it, no ledge to climb up to—like a swimmer  who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off, it just flies open. to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy,  although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel, grazing with euphemism the work of whaching.  but it has no name. it is transparent. sometimes she calls it thou.  “emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet,” records charlotte in 1828. unsociable even at home  and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out, emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers.  this sad stunted life, says one. uninteresting, unremarkable, wracked by disappointment and despair, says another.  she could have been a great navigator if she’d been male, suggests a third. meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question,  why cast the world away. for someone hooked up to thou, the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence.  but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face “lit up by a divine light”  and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life, is a space where the little raw soul  slips through. it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel, out of sight.  the little raw soul was caught by no one. she didn’t have friends, children, sex, religion, marriage, success, a salary or a fear of death. she worked  in total six months of her life (at a school in halifax) and died on the sofa at home at 2 p.m. on a winter afternoon in her thirty-first year. she spent  most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet, walking the moor or whaching. she says  it gave her peace. “all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day 4 years,” she wrote in her diary paper of 1837.  yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons, vaults, cages, bars, curbs, bits, bolts, fetters, locked windows, narrow frames, aching walls.  “why all the fuss?” asks one critic. “she wanted liberty. well didn’t she have it? a reasonably satisfactory homelife,  a most satisfactory dreamlife—why all this beating of wings? what was this cage, invisible to us, which she felt herself to be confined in?”  well there are many ways of being held prisoner, i am thinking as i stride over the moor. as a rule after lunch mother has a nap  and i go out to walk. the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light.  something inside it reminds me of childhood— it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick  and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering  something they never tell. you remember too much, my mother said to me recently.  why hold onto all that? and i said, where can i put it down? she shifted to a question about airports.  crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun.  on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else.  perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days. it is as if i could dip my hand down  into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country.  i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house, shadows  of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips.  law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea. time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room  and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying, you beauty. i can feel that beauty’s  heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room— no, i say aloud. i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water  and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood. i stop and turn and stand into the wind,  which now plunges towards me over the moor. when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die. this is not uncommon.  i took up the practice of meditation. each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers.  de profundis clamavi ad te domine. each morning a vision came to me. gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul.  i called them nudes. nude #1. woman alone on a hill. she stands into the wind.  it is a hard wind slanting from the north. long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift and blow away on the wind, leaving  an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth. it pains me to record this,  i am not a melodramatic person. but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights.  charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece. like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte  talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emily’s workshop—about the inexorable spirit (“stronger than a man, simpler than a child”),  the cruel illness (“pain no words can render”), the autonomous end (“she sank rapidly, she made haste to leave us”) and about emily’s total subjection  to a creative project she could neither understand nor control, and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth  “to breathe lightning.” the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning  and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere. it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there  but emily is not responsible. emily was in the grip. “having formed these beings she did not know what she had done,” says charlotte (of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine).  well there are many ways of being held prisoner. the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes, “on herself she had no pity.”  pitiless too are the heights, which emily called wuthering because of their “bracing ventilation” and “a north wind over the edge.”  whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her father’s house on every side, formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit,  taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities— an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another. “my love for heathcliff,” says catherine,  “resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary.” necessary? i notice the sun has dimmed  and the afternoon air sharpening. i turn and start to recross the moor towards home. what are the imperatives  that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach  of one another when it hardens? what kind of necessity is that? the last time i saw law was a black night in september. autumn had begun,  my knees were cold inside my clothes. a chill fragment of moon rose. he stood in my living room and spoke  without looking at me. not enough spin on it, he said of our five years of love. inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces  which floated apart. by now i was so cold it was like burning. i put out my hand to touch his. he moved back.  i don’t want to be sexual with you, he said. everything gets crazy. but now he was looking at me. yes, i said as i began to remove my clothes.  everything gets crazy. when nude i turned my back because he likes the back. he moved onto me.  everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself  thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me. there was no area of my mind  not appalled by this action, no part of my body that could have done otherwise. but to talk of mind and body begs the question.  soul is the place, stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind, where such necessity grinds itself out.  soul is what i kept watch on all that night. law stayed with me. we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time,  caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language like the children we used to be. that was a night that centred heaven and hell,  as emily would say. we tried to fuck but he remained limp, although happy. i came again and again, each time accumulating lucidity,  until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries  visible around them like lines on a map. i saw the lines harden. he left in the morning.  it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind. at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away.   kitchen  kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in. no sound from the rest of the house. i wait a moment then open the fridge.  brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion. my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed. after extracting the yogurt container  from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door. bluish dusk  fills the room like a sea slid back. i lean against the sink. white foods taste best to me  and i prefer to eat alone. i don’t know why. once i heard girls singing a may day song that went:  violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone.  girls are cruelest to themselves. someone like emily brontë, who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman,  had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow. we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet.  reason with him and then whip him! was her instruction (age six) to her father regarding brother branwell.  and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode (they say) into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm.  cauterization of heathcliff took longer. more than thirty years in the time of the novel, from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor  because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s (“it would degrade me to marry heathcliff”) until the wild morning  when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights. heathcliff is a pain devil.  if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence (“so he will never know how i love him”)  heathcliff would have been set free. but emily knew how to catch a devil. she put into him in place of a soul  the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought. she broke all his moments in half,  with the kitchen door standing open. i am not unfamiliar with this half-life. but there is more to it than that.  heathcliff’s sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë, so far as we know. her question,  which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil, came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen (“kichin” in emily’s spelling) where she  and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet. there is a fragment  of a poem she wrote in 1839 (about six years before wuthering heights) that says:  that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy: he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky.  who is the iron man? my mother’s voice cuts across me, from the next room where she is lying on the sofa.  is that you dear? yes ma. why don’t you turn on a light in there?  out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky. okay ma. what’s for supper?   liberty  liberty means different things to different people. i have never liked lying in bed in the morning. law did. my mother does.  but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it— moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake.  i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper. i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free.  out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost. the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky. frozen mud crunches underfoot. the sound  startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke, one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s  arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hips—i  turn and face into the wind and begin to run. goblins, devils and death stream behind me.  in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life. i had no home in goodness anymore.  to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible.  perhaps this is what people mean by original sin, i thought. but what love could be prior to it? what is prior?  what is love? my questions were not original. nor did i answer them.  mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul, not the complex mysteries of love and hate.  but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight. there were in all thirteen of them.  nude #2. woman caught in a cage of thorns. big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way  unable to stand upright. nude #3. woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead. she grips it in both hands  endeavouring to wrench it out. nude #4. woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch.  covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab. with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater  she works hard at dislodging the crab. it was about this time i began telling dr. haw  about the nudes. she said, when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them? why keep watching? why not  go away? i was amazed. go away where? i said. this still seems to me a good question.  but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk. i have reached the middle  where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water. it is frozen. a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes.  certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black. four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air. each trunk  where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures— thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face  catching grins through the bars. emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says  a messenger of hope, comes every night to me and offers, for short life, eternal liberty.  i wonder what kind of liberty this is. her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death.  they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor  in the north of england. they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life. “in so much of brontë’s work  the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama,” says one. another  refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world. i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question,  why keep watching? some people watch, that’s all i can say. there is nowhere else to go,  no ledge to climb up to. perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment, as with a very difficult sister.  “on that mind time and experience alone could work: to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable,” wrote charlotte of emily.  i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage. “my sister emily  was not a person of demonstrative character,” charlotte emphasizes, “nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings, even those nearest and dearest to her could,  with impunity, intrude unlicensed. . . .” recesses were many. one autumn day in 1845 charlotte “accidentally lighted on a ms. volume of verse in my sister emily’s handwriting.”  it was a small (4 x 6) notebook with a dark red cover marked 6d. and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand.  charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt “more than surprise” at its quality. “not at all like the poetry women generally write.”  further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel, not least for its foul language. she gently probes this recess  in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights. “a large class of readers, likewise, will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work  of words printed with all their letters, which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter only—a blank line filling the interval.”  well, there are different definitions of liberty. love is freedom, law was fond of saying. i took this to be more a wish than a thought  and changed the subject. but blank lines do not say nothing. as charlotte puts it,  “the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which,  however well meant, is weak and futile. i cannot tell what good it does—what feeling it spares— what horror it conceals.”  i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast. it is a two-way traffic,  the language of the unsaid. my favourite pages of the collected works of emily brontë are the notes at the back  recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emily’s verse, which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death. “prison for strongest[in emily’s hand] altered to lordly by charlotte.”   hero  i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not.  not. she puts her toast down on the side of her plate. you know you can pull the drapes in that room, she begins.   this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments, from what i call the rules of life series. my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night.  i open mine as wide as possible. i like to see everything, i say. what’s there to see?  moon. air. sunrise. all that light on your face in the morning. wakes you up. i like to wake up.  at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels. there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel,  the stubborn as your father channel and random channel. more toast? i interpose strongly, pushing back my chair.  those women! says my mother with an exasperated rasp. mother has chosen random channel. women?  complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper lying beside the grape jam.  the front page has a small feature about a rally for international women’s day— have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue?  nope. why, it’s a disgrace! those bathing suits— cut way up to here! (she points) no wonder!  you’re saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have high-cut legs? ma, are you serious?  well someone has to be responsible. why should women be responsible for male desire? my voice is high. oh i see you’re one of them.  one of whom? my voice is very high. mother vaults it. and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one? it looked so smart on you.  the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid. she will be eighty years old this summer.  her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around.  so ma, we’ll go—i pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate— visit dad today? she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility.  leave at eleven, home again by four? i continue. she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes. silence is assent in our code. i go into the next room to phone the taxi.  my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about 50 miles from here. he suffers from a kind of dementia  characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer. first, the presence in cerebral tissue  of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque, consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells. second, neurofibrillary snarlings  in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. there is no known cause or cure. mother visits him by taxi once a week  for the last five years. marriage is for better or for worse, she says, this is the worse.  so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town. the april light is clear as an alarm.  as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow. i wish i could carry this clarity with me  into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce. i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy. these are my two wishes.  it is hard to find the beginning of dementia. i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone.  it was a sunday night in winter. i heard his sentences filling up with fear. he would start a sentence—about weather, lose his way, start another. it made me furious to hear him floundering—  my tall proud father, former world war ii navigator! it made me merciless. i stood on the edge of the conversation,  watching him thrash about for cues, offering none, and it came to me like a slow avalanche  that he had no idea who he was talking to. much colder today i guess. . . . his voice pressed into the silence and broke off,  snow falling on it. there was a long pause while snow covered us both. well i won’t keep you,  he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land. i’ll say goodnight now, i won’t run up your bill. goodbye.  goodbye. goodbye. who are you? i said into the dial tone.  at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock (5—25—3)  to the west wing, for chronic care patients. each wing has a name. the chronic wing is our golden mile  although mother prefers to call it the last lap. father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles.  my father tilts least, i am proud of him. hi dad how y’doing? his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage  and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air. my mother lays her hand on his. hello love, she says. he jerks his hand away. we sit.  sunlight flocks through the room. mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him, grapes, arrowroot biscuits, humbugs.  he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us. he uses a language known only to himself, made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals.  once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash— you don’t say! or happy birthday to you!— but no real sentence  for more than three years now. i notice his front teeth are getting black. i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people.  he always took good care of his teeth. my mother looks up. she and i often think two halves of one thought. do you remember that gold-plated toothpick  you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london? she asks. yes i wonder what happened to it. must be in the bathroom somewhere.  she is giving him grapes one by one. they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers. he used to be a big man, over six feet tall and strong,  but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house— except the hands. the hands keep growing. each one now as big as a boot in van gogh,  they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap. but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high note—he waits,  staring into my face. that quizzical look. one eyebrow at an angle. i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home.  it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane. hands firmly behind backs, legs wide apart, chins forward.  dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch. they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942.  it is dawn. they are leaving dover for france. my father on the far left is the tallest airman,  with his collar up, one eyebrow at an angle. the shadowless light makes him look immortal,  for all the world like someone who will not weep again. he is still staring into my face. flaps down! i cry. his black grin flares once and goes out like a match.   hot  hot blue moonlight down the steep sky. i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark. fumbling  and slowly consciousness replaces the bars. dreamtails and angry liquids  swim back down to the middle of me. it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now. this is not uncommon after loss of love—  blue and black and red blasting the crater open. i am interested in anger. i clamber along to find the source.  my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed. she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires. each wire has a little black switch.  one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on. she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger.  then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house. the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit  and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws  under a load of time. i want to be beautiful again, she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily  as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound, comes— my pajamas are soaked.  anger travels through me, pushes aside everything else in my heart, pouring up the vents. every night i wake to this anger,  the soaked bed, the hot pain box slamming me each way i move. i want justice. slam.  i want an explanation. slam. i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever. slam. i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp. night springs  out the window and is gone over the moor. i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses.  emily brontë was good at cursing. falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse.  well, thou halt paid me back my love! but if there be a god above whose arm is strong, whose word is true, this hell shall wring thy spirit too!  the curses are elaborate:  there go, deceiver, go! my hand is streaming wet; my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessing—to forget! oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine, one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline!  but they do not bring her peace:  vain words, vain frenzied thoughts! no ear can hear me call— lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall. . . .  unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still— life bows to my control, but love i cannot kill!  her anger is a puzzle. it raises many questions in me, to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt  by someone who rarely left home “except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” (charlotte tells us) and who  had no more intercourse with haworth folk than “a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates.”  how did emily come to lose faith in humans? she admired their dialects, studied their genealogies, “but with them she rarely exchanged a word.”  her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor. what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith? among her biographers  is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her six-month stay in halifax, but there is no evidence at all for such an event  and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 years. banal sexism aside, i find myself tempted  to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily. but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation.  as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women. it is a chilly thought.  the heart is dead since infancy. unwept for let the body go.  suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin. the vocation of anger is not mine. i know my source.  it is stunning, it is a moment like no other, when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore. i switch off the lamp and lie on my back,  thinking about emily’s cold young soul. where does unbelief begin? when i was young  there were degrees of certainty. i could say, yes i know that i have two hands. then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear—  from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep. out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky.  our guests are darkly lodged, i whispered, gazing through the vault . . .   thou  the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness. and i prefer to put it off. it is morning.  astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east. i am walking into the light. one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god.  emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou. she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power.  thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind. thou and emily influence one another in the darkness, playing near and far at once.  she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one.” i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet, there is no question,  it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night, without the terrible sex price to pay. this is a childish idea, i know.  my education, i have to admit, has been gappy. the basic rules of male-female relations were imparted atmospherically in our family,  no direct speech allowed. i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car. father in front.  we were waiting in the driveway for mother, who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car  dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels. father glanced sideways at her. showing a good bit of leg today mother, he said  in a voice which i (age eleven) thought odd. i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say. her answer would clear this up.  but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it. later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs.  she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen. well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men,  she was saying. laugh. not ropes, thorns. i have arrived at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a low swampy place. the swamp water is frozen solid. bits of gold weed  have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages.  i’ll come when thou art saddest, laid alone in the darkened room; when the mad day’s mirth has vanished, and the smile of joy is banished,  i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling has entire, unbiased sway, and my influence o’er thee stealing grief deepening, joy congealing, shall bear thy soul away.  listen! ’tis just the hour, the awful time for thee: dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll, forerunners of a sterner power, heralds of me?  very hard to read, the messages that pass between thou and emily. in this poem she reverses their roles,  speaking not as the victim but to the victim. it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou, who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered.  it is a shock to realize that this low, slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale  for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour. she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power  but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass, which is her true creation.  those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn. it is who i am.  is it a vocation of anger? why construe silence as the real presence?  why stoop to kiss this doorstep? why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul?  emily was fond of psalm 130. “my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning, i say more than they that watch for the morning.”  i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter,  that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire: ”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns,“ says the psalmist.  but for myself i do not believe this, i am not quenched— with thou or without thou i find no shelter. i am my own nude.  and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny. i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now,  from love to anger to this cold marrow, from fire to shelter to fire. what is the opposite of believing in thou—  merely not believing in thou? no. that is too simple. that is to prepare a misunderstanding. i want to speak more clearly.  perhaps the nudes are the best way. nude #5. deck of cards. each card is made of flesh.  the living cards are days of a woman’s life. i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end. nude #6 i cannot remember.  nude #7. white room whose walls, having neither planes nor curves nor angles, are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane  like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon. it is a living surface, almost wet. lucency breathes in and out.  rainbows shudder across it. and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering, be very careful. be very careful.  nude #8. black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row. a woman stands on the disc  amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her. nude #9. transparent loam.  under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench. into the trench she is placing small white forms, i don’t know what they are. nude #10. green thorn of the world poking up  alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground. the thorn is exploding  its green blood above her in the air. everything it is it has, the voice says. nude #11. ledge in outer space.  space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions, shrieking past the woman who stands pinned  to nothing by its pressure. she peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot. nude #12. old pole in the wind.  cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines  some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole. i cannot see how they are attached—  notches? staples? nails? all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots,  then untie and float down. the wind is gone. it waits.  by this time, midway through winter, i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama. then it stopped.  days passed, months passed and i saw nothing. i continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning  with my nerves open to the air like something skinned. i saw nothing. outside the window spring storms came and went.  april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches. i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought,  how slow! as it glided soundlessly past, but still—nothing. no nudes. no thou.  a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle, hoping to trick myself into some interior vision,  but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing.  i stopped watching. i forgot about nudes. i lived my life,  which felt like a switched-off tv. something had gone through me and out and i could not own it. “no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind.  emily does not feel them,” wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister. emily had shaken free.  a soul can do that. whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings,  you and i will never know. but i can tell you what i saw. nude #13 arrived when i was not watching for it. it came at night.  very much like nude #1. and yet utterly different. i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air.  it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached, but as i came closer i saw it was a human body  trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones. and there was no pain. the wind  was cleansing the bones. they stood forth silver and necessary. it was not my body, not a woman’s body, it was the body of us all. it walked out of the light.

 god! how i hate you, you young cheerful men, whose pious poetry blossoms on your graves  as soon as you are in them, nurtured up by the salt of your corruption, and the tears of mothers, local vicars, college deans, and flanked by prefaces and photographs from all you minor poet friends—the fools— who paint their sentimental elegies where sure, no angel treads; and, living, share the dead’s brief immortality oh christ! to think that one could spread the ductile wax of his fluid youth to oxford’s glowing fires and take her seal so ill! hark how one chants— “oh happy to have lived these epic days”— “these epic days”! and he’d been to france, and seen the trenches, glimpsed the huddled dead in the periscope, hung in the rusting wire: chobed by their sickley fœtor, day and night blown down his throat: stumbled through ruined hearths, proved all that muddy brown monotony, where blood’s the only coloured thing. perhaps had seen a man killed, a sentry shot at night, hunched as he fell, his feet on the firing-step, his neck against the back slope of the trench, and the rest doubled up between, his head smashed like and egg-shell, and the warm grey brain spattered all bloody on the parados: had flashed a torch on his face, and known his friend, shot, breathing hardly, in ten minutes—gone! yet still god’s in his heaven, all is right in the best possible of worlds. the woe, even his scaled eyes must see, is partial, only a seeming woe, we cannot understand. god loves us, god looks down on this out strife and smiles in pity, blows a pipe at times and calls some warriors home. we do not die, god would not let us, he is too “intense,” too “passionate,” a whole day sorrows he because a grass-blade dies. how rare life is! on earth, the love and fellowship of men, men sternly banded: banded for what end? banded to maim and kill their fellow men— for even huns are men. in heaven above a genial umpire, a good judge of sport, won’t let us hurt each other! let’s rejoice god keeps us faithful, pens us still in fold. ah, what a faith is ours (almost, it seems, large as a mustard-seed)—we trust and trust, nothing can shake us! ah, how good god is to suffer us to be born just now, when youth that else would rust, can slake his blade in gore, where very god himself does seem to walk the bloody fields of flanders he so loves!

jehovah’s witnesses’ meeting. estela will leave the car parked between harrison street and alabama in san francisco. she’ll walk aimlessly in the warmth of the produce stores, into st. peter’s church, by the galería de la raza, china books, the bakery at la victoria. she’ll walk in the night with her eyes burning, seeing him laughing, the young man in his black box apartment, laughing, laughing, laughing like a little man.  the little man laughs. it’s an apartment of marriage and fists. the wife-beater laughs in his easy chair. next to his bed he sees the anxious note. he focuses on the signature with the e broken in three places.  he looks at the stained and unmade sheets, the dull curtains, the crushed cigarettes and the ashes. the black-and-white television announces a sale of living room furniture. with his can of beer he observes. smokes. thinks.  within a week or two they’ll take his cousin to san quentin prison, again. the last time he saw him he was a gardener at a

bloated, skin yellowed, hair long and greasy. weakness consumes him night after night. he can’t speak, tires easily. but he can hear. he hears the white heels of the doctors and nurses running to the rooms of the dying. he hears footsteps fluttering like doves over the floor or like the leaves of fever falling from the roof of hell.  it’s eleven o’clock at night. he hears the abandoned man in room 200 fall out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water. he hears the iv tubes bursting, the sweet plasma spinning between the walls, the bag slipping to the floor and splattering through the night’s open screens.  the man screams. vomits blood and ulcers. gets tangled up in sheets and transparent plastic veins. after half an hour doves fly in. the leaves fall. fast.  after a few days a black man enters room 199. an orderly. he cleans his body with a warm sponge. his hands run slowly down the yellowed back, the belly and fragile shoulders of randi. dark birds fly over a forgotten landscape. randi looks at his mother rubbing his chest with alcohol to quiet the cough before he sleeps. he turns his face. imagines his one-room house, a trailer his father made out of an old car. they’re on a little ranch at the outskirts of an unknown town. the mountains reflect the afternoon’s coppery heat. from afar you can see birds crossing above the saguaros and the sky.  the last time i saw randi was at san francisco city college. he had just turned in all his papers so he could drop out at midterm. he didn’t want to go on with it. it was a farce.  like when he was invited to read poetry near the galería de la raza in the mission district. he never showed up. took 18th instead of 24th street. some latinos beat him up. they noticed a homosexual air about him.  lies do not exist, only the

 in the harsh glare of an easily reprehensible life. the channel changer is lost in the crack of an infinite sofa. everything falls apart, everything breaks down, torn into a million fragments, jericho everyday.  i want to be the blameless victim in this canceled puppet show, the marionette every mother loves, the one souvenirs are modeled from.  (in that lifetime, elton john will write mushy ballads just for me. michael jackson will want to be my best friend. he’d take me to the neverland ranch, and by the llama feeding trough, he’d say something like, “you’re a great guy, don’t give up, stay positive!” and i’d say, “michael, you fucking idiot, i am positive!” and he’d say, “oh, you’re so funny! would you like to touch bubbles?” and i would.)  in the crux of my hollow innocent youth, i believed that my teddy bears had feelings. to cure me of this, my guardians made me give them to the church missionaries’ children. scrubbed-clean rosy-cheeked blonde kids who smelled of sweat and talc, who were in constant wide-blue-eyed bewilderment as to why they were profusely perspiring in the tropics, instead of living out some winter wonderland bobsey twins fantasy, who were oblivious to their parents’ desperate efforts to save the dusky masses, ignorant enough to believe in the secret lives of stuffed animals. i could not eat animal crackers because i did not want to hurt the poor things; but, braised the right way, i could eat any part of a pig, starting with the head, working on the soft flesh around the eyes, savoring its raspy tongue with a dipping sauce of ginger, chilies and lime.  oh blameless innocent victim. what measures a lifetime?  i used to have this theory about how much life a human body could hold. it all had to do with the number of heartbeats. each human is assigned a number determined by an unknown power cascading over the dark waters of the unformed earth.  for some, it was a magnificently high number, seen only in richie rich comics, and for others, it was frightfully low, like twenty-six. no bargaining, no coupons, no white flower day sale, no specials. once you hit your number, you croak. i imagined the angels in heaven and the demons in hell gathering to watch the counters turn, like how i enjoyed watching the speedometer line up to a row of similar numbers, and especially when the row of nines turned into the row of zeros.  oh blameless innocent victim. what measures eternity?  an eternal damnation. an everlasting love.  i could not imagine the night sky stretched out forever, so i decided that it came to an end at some point, by a velvet rope it ended and beyond that rope were row after row of cushioned seats, a majestic cosmic theater, playing every movie i can remember.  i want to be able to evoke those blameless and innocent days, to revel in their ignorance and goodness as if they have the power to protect and to heal, and to strengthen, and to bring me to safety long after all other resources were exhausted.  but i emerge anew in the wreckage, blinking in the sunlight,  the residue of salt water in my belly.  you know what they say, god never closes a door before making sure that the windows are barricaded and the fire escape is inaccessible.  i used to know how to stop the revolution of planets.  i used to know how to save the world.  now, i don’t know anything anymore.

 hard rock / was / “known not to take no shit from nobody,” and he had the scars to prove it: split purple lips, lumbed ears, welts above his yellow eyes, and one long scar that cut across his temple and plowed through a thick canopy of kinky hair.  the word / was / that hard rock wasn’t a mean nigger anymore, that the doctors had bored a hole in his head, cut out part of his brain, and shot electricity through the rest. when they brought hard rock back, handcuffed and chained, he was turned loose, like a freshly gelded stallion, to try his new status. and we all waited and watched, like a herd of sheep, to see if the word was true.  as we waited we wrapped ourselves in the cloak of his exploits: “man, the last time, it took eight screws to put him in the hole.” “yeah, remember when he smacked the captain with his dinner tray?” “he set the record for time in the hole—67 straight days!” “ol hard rock! man, that’s one crazy nigger.” and then the jewel of a myth that hard rock had once bit a screw on the thumb and poisoned him with syphilitic spit.  the testing came, to see if hard rock was really tame. a hillbilly called him a black son of a bitch and didn’t lose his teeth, a screw who knew hard rock from before shook him down and barked in his face. and hard rock did nothing. just grinned and looked silly, his eyes empty like knot holes in a fence.  and even after we discovered that it took hard rock exactly 3 minutes to tell you his first name, we told ourselves that he had just wised up, was being cool; but we could not fool ourselves for long, and we turned away, our eyes on the ground. crushed. he had been our destroyer, the doer of things we dreamed of doing but could not bring ourselves to do, the fears of years, like a biting whip, had cut deep bloody grooves across our backs.

 each morning, downward, maria stella maris church glows out the passenger-side window. further, the corner where the salvation army stood and hart crane spent the night. at a shore-edge bar, where they'd finally met up, they shared bottles, walked out toward being together, a hotel, and then got rolled. crane spent the night in the shelter. e., bruised, shipped out the next morning. the hungover poet took the train back toward altadena. from my car, not much has changed; i see young stevedores shrug off last night's drunk. past new dock street, a cigarette splits, balloons into orange under my wheels. hot ash. my unkindness is thrown over and over. door to door, a ride is for what i've squirreled away, not riches but a pile: the ways no thing mattered, how a kiss didn't count, how a friendship could be severed by a coyote walking between us or a dream. my windshield is a tracery. long ago, down gaffey, we raced in my hairdresser's sports car. she drove with her knees. her perfume, the want, filled the heated car. we drove once to her husband's parking lot, switched cars—he'd shipped out for days—and toured in his jeep. but in this home i've chosen, there's a church on every corner and mourners in between. boys pair up and nothing happens. girls hold hands. we get rolled. they ship out. liquor is drained. the train returns to altadena. mary, star of the sea, watches over the gem of a filthy port like the hawk, diamond-shaped ahead. she lets me pass five days a week. on my way uphill there are ovals of golden light, then no one home. shoeless child, chimes, and stevedore off work. burnt lawn. hellhole. haven. next stop, my house.

 (civil war photography by t. o’sullivan, 1866) raisin-black blood dries on their faces. thick wool clothes. lumps of bloated bodies lying on their backs.  mouths open. chins pointing to the sky. as though blown over backward. or turned.  fingers swollen. boots and rifles missing. coats and jackets pulled up exposing gray shirts, bloody underwear.  the sky drifts toward sap green. no fences. no stone walls.

 he sees through stone he has the secret eyes this old black one who under prison skies sits pressed by the sun against the western wall his pipe between purple gums  the years fall like overripe plums bursting red flesh on the dark earth  his time is not my time but i have known him in a time gone  he led me trembling cold into the dark forest taught me the secret rites to make it with a woman to be true to my brothers to make my spear drink the blood of my enemies  now black cats circle him flash white teeth snarl at the air mashing green grass beneath shining muscles ears peeling his words he smiles he knows the hunt    the enemy he has the secret eyes he sees through stone

 the chinaman said don’t take the hardware and gave me a steak i couldn’t cut (except the fat) and there was an ant circling the coffee cup; i left a dime tip and broke out a stick of cancer, and outside i gave an old bum who looked about the way i felt, i gave him a quarter, and then i went up to see the old man strong as steel girders, fit for bombers and blondes, up the green rotten steps that housed rats and past the secretaries showing leg and doing nothing and the old man sat there looking at me through two pairs of glasses and a vacation in paris, and he said, kid, i hear you been takin’ marylou out, and i said, just to dinner, boss, and he said, just to dinner, eh? you couldn’t hold that broad’s pants on with all the rivets on 5th street, and please remember you are a shipping clerk, i am the boss here and i pay these broads and i pay you. yes, sir, i said, and i felt he was going to skip it but he slid my last check across the desk and i took it and walked out past all the lovely legs, the skirts pulled up to the ass, marylou’s ass, ann’s ass, vicki’s ass, all of them, and i went down to the bar and george said whatya gonna do now, and i said go to russia or hollywood park, and i looked up in time to see marylou come in, the long thin nose, the delicate face, the lips, the legs, the breasts, the music, the talk the love the laughing and she said i quit when i found out and the bastard got down on his knees and cried and kissed the hem of my skirt and offered me money and i walked out and he blubbered like a baby. george, i said, another drink, and i put a quarter in the juke and the sun came out and i looked outside in time to see the old bum with my quarter and a little more luck that had turned into a happy wine-bottle, and a bird even flew by cheep cheep, right there on eastside downtown, no kidding, and the chinaman came in for a quickie claiming somebody had stolen a spoon and a coffee cup and i leaned over and bit marylou on the ear and the whole joint rocked with music and freedom and i decided that russia was too far away and hollywood park just close enough.

 soul and race are private dominions, memories and modal songs, a tenor blossoming, which would paint suffering a clear color but is not in this victorian house without oil in zero degree weather and a forty-mile-an-hour wind; it is all a well-knit family: a love supreme. oak leaves pile up on walkway and steps, catholic as apples in a special mist of clear white children who love my children. i play “alabama” on a warped record player skipping the scratches on your faces over the fibrous conical hairs of plastic under the wooden floors.  dreaming on a train from new york to philly, you hand out six notes which become an anthem to our memories of you: oak, birch, maple, apple, cocoa, rubber. for this reason martin is dead; for this reason malcolm is dead; for this reason coltrane is dead; in the eyes of my first son are the browns of these men and their music.

 i  the leaves of blue came drifting down. in the corner madeleine reierbacher was reading lorna doone. the bay’s water helped to implement the structuring of the garden hose. the envelope fell. was it pink or was it red? consult lorna doone. there, voyager, you will find your answer. the savant grapeade stands remember madeleine reierbacher. madeleine reierbacher says, “if you are happy, there is no one to keep you from being happy; don’t let them!” madeleine reierbacher went into the racing car. the racing car was orange and red. madeleine reierbacher drove to beale street. there maddy doffed her garments to get into some more comfortable clothes. jazz was already playing in beale street when madeleine reierbacher arrived there. madeleine reierbacher picked up the yellow horn and began to play. no one had ever heard anything comparable to the playing of madeleine reierbacher. what a jazz musician! the pianist missed his beats because he was so excited. the drummer stared out the window in ecstasy at the yellow wooden trees. the orchestra played “september in the rain,” “mugging,” and “i’m full of love.” madeleine reierbacher rolled up her sleeves; she picked up her horn; she played “blues in the rain.” it was the best jazz anyone had ever heard. it was mentioned in the newspapers. st. louis! madeleine reierbacher became a celebrity. she played with pesky summerton and muggsy pierce. madeleine cut numerous disks. her best waxings are “alpha beta and gamma” and “wing song.” one day madeleine was riding on a donkey when she came to a yellow light; the yellow light did not change. madeleine kept hoping it would change to green or red. she said, “as long as you have confidence, you need be afraid of nothing.” madeleine saw the red smokestacks, she looked at the thin trees, and she regarded the railroad tracks. the yellow light was unchanging. madeleine’s donkey dropped dead from his mortal load. madeleine reierbacher, when she fell to earth, picked up a blade of grass and began to play. “the blues!” cried the workmen of the vicinity, and they ran and came in great numbers to where madeleine reierbacher was. they saw her standing in that simple field beside the railroad track playing, and they saw that light changing to green and red, and they saw that donkey stand up and rise into the sky; and madeleine reierbacher was like a clot of blue in the midst of the blue of all that sky, and the young farmers screamed in excitement, and the workmen dropped their heavy boards and stones in their excitement, and they cried, “o madeleine reierbacher, play us the ‘lead flint blues’ once again!”  o railroad stations, pennants, evenings, and lumberyards! when will you ever bring us such a beautiful soloist again? an argent strain shows on the reddish face of the sun. madeleine reierbacher stands up and screams, “i am getting wet! you are all egotists!” her brain floats up into the lyric atmosphere of the sky. we must figure out a way to keep our best musicians with us. the finest we have always melt in the light blue sky! in the middle of a concert, sometimes, they disappear, like anvils. (the music comes down to us with sweet white hands on our shoulders.) we stare up in surprise; and we hear madeleine’s best-known tune once again, “if you ain’t afraid of life, life can’t be afraid for you.” madeleine! come back and sing to us!   2  dick looked up from his blackboard. had he really written a history of the jazz age? he stared at his television set; the technicolor jazz program was coming on. the program that day was devoted to pictures of madeleine reierbacher playing her saxophone in the golden age of jazz. dick looked at his blackboard. it was a mass of green and orange lines. here and there a red chalk line interlaced with the others. he stared attentively at the program.  it was a clear and blue white day. amos said, “the calibration is finished. now there need be no more jazz.”  in his mountain home old lucas dog laughed when he heard what amos had said. he smilingly picked up his yellow horn to play, but all that came out of it was steam.

 a night piece  (july, 1863) no sleep. the sultriness pervades the air and binds the brain—a dense oppression, such as tawny tigers feel in matted shades, vexing their blood and making apt for ravage. beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads vacant as libya. all is hushed near by. yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf of muffled sound, the atheist roar of riot. yonder, where parching sirius set in drought balefully glares red arson—there—and there. the town is taken by its rats—ship-rats and rats of the wharves. all civil charms and priestly spells which late held hearts in awe— fear-bound, subjected to a better sway than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve, and man rebounds whole aeons back in nature. hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead, and ponderous drag that shakes the wall. wise draco comes, deep in the midnight roll of black artillery; he comes, though late; in code corroborating calvin’s creed and cynic tyrannies of honest kings; he comes, nor parlies; and the town, redeemed, gives thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds the grimy slur on the republic’s faith implied, which holds that man is naturally good, and—more—is nature’s roman, never to be scourged.

 how the thickest of them erupt just above the ear, cresting in waves so stiff no wind can move them.   let us praise them in all of their varieties, some skinny as the bands of headphones, some rising from a part that extends halfway around the head, others four or five strings stretched so taut the scalp resembles a musical instrument.   let us praise the sprays that hold them, and the combs that coax such abundance to the front of the head in the mirror, the combers entirely forget the back.   and let us celebrate the combers, who address the old sorrow of time’s passing day after day, bringing out of the barrenness of mid-life this ridiculous and wonderful harvest, no wishful flag of hope, but, thick, or thin, the flag itself, unfurled for us all in subways, offices, and malls across america.

NEW POEM
 to robert hass and in memory of elliot gilbert slow dulcimer, gavotte and bow, in autumn, bashō and his friends go out to view the moon; in summer, gasoline rainbow in the gutter,  the secret courtesy that courses like ichor through the old form of the rude, full-scale joke, impossible to tell in writing. “bashō”  he named himself, “banana tree”: banana after the plant some grateful students gave him, maybe in appreciation of his guidance  threading a long night through the rules and channels of their collaborative linking-poem scored in their teacher’s heart: live, rigid, fluid  like passages etched in a microscopic circuit. elliot had in his memory so many jokes they seemed to breed like microbes in a culture  inside his brain, one so much making another it was impossible to tell them all: in the court-culture of jokes, a top banana.  imagine a court of one: the queen a young mother, unhappy, alone all day with her firstborn child and her new baby in a squalid apartment  of too few rooms, a different race from her neighbors. she tells the child she’s going to kill herself. she broods, she rages. hoping to distract her,  the child cuts capers, he sings, he does imitations of different people in the building, he jokes, he feels if he keeps her alive until the father  gets home from work, they’ll be okay till morning. it’s laughter versus the bedroom and the pills. what is he in his efforts but a courtier?  impossible to tell his whole delusion. in the first months when i had moved back east from california and had to leave a message  on bob’s machine, i used to make a habit of telling the tape a joke; and part-way through, i would pretend that i forgot the punchline,  or make believe that i was interrupted— as though he’d be so eager to hear the end he‘d have to call me back. the joke was elliot’s,  more often than not. the doctors made the blunder that killed him some time later that same year. one day when i got home i found a message  on my machine from bob. he had a story about two rabbis, one of them tall, one short, one day while walking along the street together  they see the corpse of a chinese man before them, and bob said, sorry, he forgot the rest. of course he thought that his joke was a dummy,  impossible to tell—a dead-end challenge. but here it is, as elliot told it to me: the dead man’s widow came to the rabbis weeping,  begging them, if they could, to resurrect him. shocked, the tall rabbi said absolutely not. but the short rabbi told her to bring the body  into the study house, and ordered the shutters closed so the room was night-dark. then he prayed over the body, chanting a secret blessing  out of kabala. “arise and breathe,” he shouted; but nothing happened. the body lay still. so then the little rabbi called for hundreds of candles  and danced around the body, chanting and praying in hebrew, then yiddish, then aramaic. he prayed in turkish and egyptian and old galician  for nearly three hours, leaping about the coffin in the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes seemed not to touch the floor. with one last prayer  sobbed in the spanish of before the inquisition he stopped, exhausted, and looked in the dead man’s face. panting, he raised both arms in a mystic gesture  and said, “arise and breathe!” and still the body lay as before. impossible to tell in words how elliot’s eyebrows flailed and snorted  like shaggy mammoths as—the chinese widow granting permission—the little rabbi sang the blessing for performing a circumcision  and removed the dead man’s foreskin, chanting blessings in finnish and swahili, and bathed the corpse from head to foot, and with a final prayer  in babylonian, gasping with exhaustion, he seized the dead man’s head and kissed the lips and dropped it again and leaping back commanded,  “arise and breathe!” the corpse lay still as ever. at this, as when bashō’s disciples wind along the curving spine that links the renga  across the different voices, each one adding a transformation according to the rules of stasis and repetition, all in order  and yet impossible to tell beforehand, elliot changes for the punchline: the wee rabbi, still panting, like a startled boxer,  looks at the dead one, then up at all those watching, a kind of mel brooks gesture: “hoo boy!” he says, “now that’s what i call really dead.” o mortal  powers and princes of earth, and you immortal lords of the underground and afterlife, jehovah, raa, bol-morah, hecate, pluto,  what has a brilliant, living soul to do with your harps and fires and boats, your bric-a-brac and troughs of smoking blood? provincial stinkers,  our languages don’t touch you, you’re like that mother whose small child entertained her to beg her life. possibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi,  the one who washed his hands of all those capers right at the outset. or maybe he became the author of these lines, a one-man renga  the one for whom it seems to be impossible to tell a story straight. it was a routine procedure. when it was finished the physicians  told sandra and the kids it had succeeded, but elliot wouldn’t wake up for maybe an hour, they should go eat. the two of them loved to bicker  in a way that on his side went back to yiddish, on sandra’s to some sicilian dialect. he used to scold her endlessly for smoking.  when she got back from dinner with their children the doctors had to tell them about the mistake. oh swirling petals, falling leaves! the movement  of linking renga coursing from moment to moment is meaning, bob says in his haiku book. oh swirling petals, all living things are contingent,  falling leaves, and transient, and they suffer. but the universal is the goal of jokes, especially certain ethnic jokes, which taper  down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures toward their preposterous ithaca. there’s one a journalist told me. he heard it while a hero  of the south african freedom movement was speaking to elderly jews. the speaker’s own right arm had been blown off by right-wing letter-bombers.  he told his listeners they had to cast their ballots for the anc—a group the old jews feared as “in with the arabs.” but they started weeping  as the old one-armed fighter told them their country needed them to vote for what was right, their vote could make a country their children could return to  from london and chicago. the moved old people applauded wildly, and the speaker’s friend whispered to the journalist, “it’s the belgian army  joke come to life.” i wish that i could tell it to elliot. in the belgian army, the feud between the flemings and walloons grew vicious,  so out of hand the army could barely function. finally one commander assembled his men in one great room, to deal with things directly.  they stood before him at attention. “all flemings,” he ordered, “to the left wall.” half the men clustered to the left. “now all walloons,” he ordered,  “move to the right.” an equal number crowded against the right wall. only one man remained at attention in the middle: “what are you, soldier?”  saluting, the man said, “sir, i am a belgian.” “why, that’s astonishing, corporal—what’s your name?” saluting again, “rabinowitz,” he answered:  a joke that seems at first to be a story about the jews. but as the renga describes religious meaning by moving in drifting petals  and brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer the changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl, so in the joke, just under the raucous music  of fleming, jew, walloon, a courtly allegiance moves to the dulcimer, gavotte and bow, over the banana tree the moon in autumn—  allegiance to a state impossible to tell.  
NEW POEM
 when i look at it, it’s simple, really. i hated life there. september, once filled with animal deaths and toughened hay. and the smells  of fall were boiled-down beets and potatoes or the farmhands’ breeches smeared with oil and diesel  as they rode into town, dusty and pissed. the radio station split time between metal and tejano, and the only action  happened on friday nights where the high school football team gave everyone a chance at forgiveness. the town left no room  for novelty or change. the sheriff knew everyone’s son and despite that, we’d cruise up and down the avenues, switching between  brake and gearshift. we’d fight and spit chew into big gulp cups and have our hearts broken nightly. in that town i learned  to fire a shotgun at nine and wring a chicken’s neck with one hand by twirling the bird and whipping it straight like a towel.  but i loved the place once. everything was blonde and cracked and the irrigation ditches stretched to the end of the earth. you could  ride on a bicycle and see clearly the outline of every leaf or catch on the streets each word of a neighbor’s argument.  nothing could happen there and if i willed it, the place would have me slipping over its rocks into the river with the sugar plant’s steam  or signing papers at a storefront army desk, buttoned up with medallions and a crew cut, eyeing the next recruits.  if i’ve learned anything, it’s that i could be anywhere, staring at a hunk of asphalt or listening to the clap of billiard balls  against each other in a bar and hear my name. indifference now? some. i shook loose, but that isn’t the whole story. the fact is  i’m still in love. and when i wake up, i watch my son yawn, and my mind turns his upswept hair into cornstalks  at the edge of a field. stillness is an acre, and his body idles, deep like heavy machinery. i want to take him back there,  to the small town of my youth and hold the book of wildflowers open for him, and look. i want him to know the colors of horses,  to run with a cattail in his hand and watch as its seeds fly weightless as though nothing mattered, as though  the little things we tell ourselves about our pasts stay there, rising slightly and just out of reach.  
NEW POEM
 we aged a hundred years and this descended in just one hour, as at a stroke. the summer had been brief and now was ended; the body of the ploughed plains lay in smoke.  the hushed road burst in colors then, a soaring lament rose, ringing silver like a bell. and so i covered up my face, imploring god to destroy me before battle fell.  and from my memory the shadows vanished of songs and passions—burdens i'd not need. the almighty bade it be—with all else banished— a book of portents terrible to read.

 who bequeathed to chicago a school of music. so in pieria, from the wedded bliss of time and memory, the muses came to be the means of rich oblivion, and rest from cares.  and when the thunderer took heaven, then the titans warred on him for pity of mankind. but the great law, which is the law of music, not of bread, set atlas for a pillar, manacled his brother to the rocks of the scythia, and under aetna fixed the furious typhon. so should thought rule, not force. and amphion, pursuing justice, entered thebes and slew his mother's spouse; but when he would make sure and fortify the city, then he took the lyre that hermes gave, and played, and watched the stones move and assemble, till a wall engirded thebes and kept the citadel beyond the reach of arrows and of fire. what other power but harmony can build a city, and what gift so magical as that by which a city lifts its walls? so men, in years to come, shall feel the power of this man moving through the high-ranged thought which plans for beauty, builds for larger life. the stones shall rise in towers to answer him.

 i  the sky here is american like the blue of your eyes; the folds of your eyelids the hindu kush mountain.  the rich vein of the hindu kush only a stony ridge cutting across the parched soil of afghanistan  on which the primal play of progress comes to pass.   ii  locked in, its people: nomadic, peasant or simply pleasant, green-eyed, blue-eyed, brown-eyed or simply wide-eyed.  its great teacher: noor mohammad taraki, the proud translator of great works into pashto, dari, turkic and uzbek. its cities: herat, kabul, kandahar.   iii  assuredly, the pilgrims descend the emerald-strewn panjsher valley. they have come to water and tend  a young tree. time is at hand, for the unhurried descent of the western offering,  whose yellow parachute will slow its fall. and this tree, which will grow underneath the cluster bomb, will hold up the pomegranate to the blue sky.   iv  the tick tock and whirr of metal and material in the hidden azure vault of the air  has so far unleashed the american ahistoricality upon the two tall bamiyan buddhas.  ordained stone must give way to bared rock face. grieve not. rejoice, for the spirit triumphs here.   v  when kabul was as beautiful as leningrad, when our hearts hadn't grown weary, when taraki could take a stroll down the streets of kabul with a confident smile, when he could still be afghanistan's maxim gorky, when our erstwhile bachelor could enjoy the company of dancing girls like a mogul emperor, when the way forward was the way forward.   vi  the uncertain exile is never to rome— no picture postcards of the coliseum to send home—  but to a mud hovel among other mud hovels by the edge of the city of islamabad.  for the uncertain exile has nothing to do with the divine or with any other kind of comedy,  but with what has remained or with what reminds: with the trace of terror that persists.   vii  in this part of the world the children know and have desires to be a martyr, to enter paradise, to leave this life.  of the twenty-nine different names for the garden, they know all twenty-nine by heart.  for this part of the world began with a garden and will end as an open ditch piled up with bodies.   viii  grant me antigone's strength to forbear for the sun has come unstuck from a blue sky gone black,  stolen for effect, and the veiled moon stands in, for the mourning women standing next to platters of rice,  signifying the historically sound end of forgetfulness, returning our agency to mourn  the collaborations of the merchant capitalist class with the unlistening, ahistorical god.   ix  if only gandhi's spinning wheel had spun a million yards of cloth  we would have covered all our war dead. and as for tents, we would have built  cities upon cities of tents to keep the rain out for all our refugees. and then and only then  would we have mourned our war dead, mourned our war dead.

 the large man in the budweiser tee with serpents twining on his arms has leukemia. it doesn’t seem right but they’ve told him he won’t die for years if he sticks with the treatment. he’s talking about his years in the foundry,  running a crane on an overhead track in the mill. eight hours a day moving ingots into rollers. sometimes without a break because of the bother of getting down. never had an accident. never hurt anyone. he had that much control.  his problem is that electricity arced through his body and accumulated. when he got down at the end of a shift he could squeeze a forty-watt light bulb between thumb and finger and make it flare. all the guys came around to see that.

 listen to the creepy proclamation,  blown through the lairs of the forest-nation  —vachel lindsay 1   who knows why my baby left me? who knows where she could have gone? is she hiding in the center of some little-known downtown? has she been seduced by villains? have they got her gagged and bound? vanished from the lost and found with no trace and no reminder . . . ? yeah, she’s lost, but i will find her down in the faraway suburbs.  2                        puerto rico   in guaynabo and tao baja the theorists and professors are playing rhetorical poker with their identity cards, they are shooting wads of wisdom to impress the senile deans; meanwhile, the good citizens are all working for the government, cheating on taxes and spouses down in the faraway suburbs.  3                        new york   the greyhound wheezes its way from new york up to poughkeepsie; i pass the time singing “gypsy” by fleetwood mac, a cappella; and the watercolor landscape falls apart on the gray planes; the diners and the dead-ends, the deserted factories, and the doors creak noisily down in the faraway suburbs.  4   the are prehistoric skeletons at the beach on staten island and the jellyfish are dancing slow, hydrochloric waltzes: there are doric-style chalets with south american servants where the little brothers play; sniffing underarms and solvents while the dog shows off its teeth down in the faraway suburbs.  5   here the end of the expressway gives way to medieval forests and correctional facilities and mcdonald’s without tourists; i’m overwhelmed by the view of the mansions on the plains, the housing projects, the flames creeping through the dead of winter as the landfill burns tonight down in the faraway suburbs.  6                        california   in the righteous neighborhoods, atherton, west palo alto, they’re paving over the asphalt with the gravel of privilege— all ones hears are the arpeggios of the pre-recorded pianos, and the trembling of the hands that are serving themselves gin and the shot glass shattering down in the faraway suburbs.  7   far from all the shantytowns, in millbrae and redwood city, one more neighborhood committee is creating civic centers and more monumental malls catering to healthy pleasures: peewee softball in the summers, window-shopping, cineplex, and those fruity tex-mex shakes down in the faraway suburbs.  8   a distant, majestic sun licks the cliffs and the embankments, i search for your embalmed eye on the coast of the pacific. marin county  in particular has its share of urban ghosts, like those midget saxophonists who long for their days of glory and are now telling their story down in the faraway suburbs.  9   i’ve searched for you in each corner of this innocuous continent— could it be you’re facing me? could it be that you’re my neighbor? that the downtown and the eye balm and the grime that coats your hands are all arcane holograms? that your epileptic smile died that antiseptic night down in the faraway suburbs.

 when you open the door, everything falls into place— the little ferry by the wharf, fir trees and thujas. an old woman, feeding ducks, seems as old as leni riefenstahl. at the base of the hill, chestnut trees, not yet in full bloom, are younger—but probably as old as her films. all is wet and bright. a hedgehog or god-knows-whose-soul is rummaging in last year's leaves. dead water and living water fill the plain. the twins celsius and fahrenheit are predicting spring weather—while a shadow obscures the past (just like the present). the first serene weeks scour the bridges in a peaceful corner of europe between wannsee and potsdam—where much has happened, but, probably, nothing more will. for days we have been watching a ragged crow—in the garden, sometimes on the roof. the ancients would have said her stubbornness augurs something. emerging from the wood's depths, she lights on one antenna crossbar then another, her surface bright as mercury in a thermometer's glass. but these are fever marks we are incapable of understanding. the beginning of agony? the past does not enlighten us—but still, it attempts to say something. perhaps the crow knows more about us and about history's dirt than we do ourselves. of what does she want to remind us? of the black photos, the black headphones of radio operators, black signatures under documents, of the unarmed with their frozen pupils—of the prisoner's boot or the trunk of the refugee? probably not. we will remember this anyway, though it won't make us any wiser. the bird signifies only stoicism and patience. if you ask for them, your request will be granted.

 i heard from people after the shootings. people i knew well or barely or not at all. largely the same message: how horrible it was, how little there was to say about how horrible it was. people wrote, called, mostly e-mailed because they know i teach at virginia tech, to say, there’s nothing to say. eventually i answered these messages: there’s nothing to say back except of course there’s nothing to say, thank you for your willingness to say it. because this was about nothing. a boy who felt that he was nothing, who erased and entered that erasure, and guns that are good for nothing, and talk of guns that is good for nothing, and spring that is good for flowers, and jesus for some, and scotch for others, and “and” for me in this poem, “and” that is good for sewing the minutes together, which otherwise go about going away, bereft of us and us of them. like a scarf left on a train and nothing like a scarf left on a train. as if the train, empty of everything but a scarf, still opens its doors at every stop, because this is what a train does, this is what a man does with his hand on a lever, because otherwise, why the lever, why the hand, and then it was over, and then it had just begun.

 the chain uncouples, and his jacket hangs on the peg over hers, and he's inside.  she stalls in the kitchen, putting the kettle on, buys herself a minute looking for two matching cups for the lime-flower tea, not really lime but linden, heart-shaped leaves and sticky flowers that smell of antifreeze. she talks a wall around her, twists the string tighter around the tea bag in her spoon. but every conversation has to break somewhere, and at the far end of the sofa he sits, warming his hands around the cup he hasn't tasted yet, and listens on with such an exasperating show of patience it's almost a relief to hear him ask it: if you're not using your body right now maybe you'd let me borrow it for a while?

 at the supper for street people the young man who goes about all muffled up from harm, with whatever he has found, newspaper pages carefully folded to make a weirdly festive hat or hood, down almost over his eyes. everything carefully arranged to make him other. the paper-covered razor blade in his mouth, or the bit of wood, like carrying a message.  a fantasy so clever, outwitting itself, that it became what it was he was, and so he was what it was. the long loose shirt too big for him, the pantaloons too big for him loose like the pantaloons of the circus clown, some kind of jacket too big, he got it somewhere. his burden slept dreaming everywhere upon him. as if his whole body and the clothes he wore dreamed of his condition and the dream came true.  his clothes slept on him as if they were his lover.

 yes, i've been in rome, at least two times, though on second thought it probably was three or maybe five. when was the last? that's easy, for i remember it exactly— at least what it was like when i first left. you mean a part of you remains in rome?  not really, for when i was first in rome i was truly there. that ended the second time, though i only realized it when i first left. so when you were in rome your last time was consumed by thoughts of leaving? not exactly. as time went on, i came around at last,  thinking: obsess about leaving and nothing lasts; i'll end up never having been in rome. yet back then did you know just what exactly it meant to be in rome during that time you thought about leaving, even if it was then you saw what you'd lose if you had left?  even at the time when i first left i'd no idea. but you're not saying the last you saw of rome was your third visit, for wasn't it earlier that you felt you'd never leave rome? no, all that happened there my second time, though to this day i feel about rome exactly  what i felt from the first. what that means exactly is hard to say, for perhaps i never left, since after all, my being there the first time didn't involve my leaving. tell me then, at last, was it once or twice? were you really in rome? why certainly—i'm sure, i know i was,  and on top of that you might even say i was there time and again, everything there exactly just the same, or like my last time in rome, me feeling as if i'd never really left. but tell me now precisely, was the last you saw of rome indeed that second time?  to be exact, it happened the very first time that i saw rome, darkness falling as i left causing me to see what simply couldn't last.

 in the frozen square, the student asks me if i will sell him the books from my backpack. he hides them under his winter coat. steam rises from the whole wheat rolls we break open at the breakfast table. we drink hot apple tea and pronounce the skyline “charming.” in a jail a man counts the visible bones, and recounts them in the blaze of morning. to turn a self to light proves painful — each piece must be dissected in turn; you pass through every feeling imaginable, so many you might make a dictionary — dread to disgust, delight to degradation. the prisoner remembers wanting only to read as if in a fever — running fingers over pyramids of words as if he might translate himself from this life to a more vivid existence in which he cuts open the pages with a knife in plain sight of everyone like a man eating meat and potatoes at the dinner table. not that world; this one where blue light and sharpened files, where identikit and stamps on passports, where the book in his back- pack is a crime, and i have sold him down the river for ideas i barely value — the volumes flung carelessly across my hotel room, while he picks mushrooms on the edge of dread, pallid ghosts of what won’t speak or be spoken. or where i remember what it is to be present in the world, and i turn away, unable to bear it — so much light and dread, so much in the darkness growing or simply how hard to ever remain in place.

 the startling pleasures all broke down, it was her first arthritic spring. inside her furs, her bones, secure, suddenly became a source of pain and froze on a saturday afternoon while she was listening to “la boheme.”  strength had been her weakness, and because it was, she got to like the exhilaration of catastrophes that prove our lives as stupid as we think, but pain, more stupid than stupidity, is an accident of animals in which, once caught, the distances are never again the same.  yet there was another jane in jane: she smelled the inside of a logarithm, and felt a gothic arch rise in her chest, her clavicle widening to bear the weight of the two smooth plumb lines of her breasts, the blueprints forming an enormous skirt around her body. arch and star and cross swung like little lights inside her head, a church and temple rising from the floor, nave and transept and an altar where, unbidden, she saw a kind of sacrifice; the knife was in her hand, the stick, the whip; she cried at her cruelty and cried to be outside of her defenses. and just then,  the windows buckled in, the paintings cracked, the furniture went walking by itself, all out of her control. and it was pain that let her know she was herself again: she wore a cloak of fire on her skin, and power, power floated up to her.

 on this day i complete my thirty-sixth year 'tis time this heart should be unmoved, since others it hath ceased to move: yet though i cannot be beloved, still let me love!  my days are in the yellow leaf; the flowers and fruits of love are gone; the worm—the canker, and the grief are mine alone!  the fire that on my bosom preys is lone as some volcanic isle; no torch is kindled at its blaze a funeral pile.  the hope, the fear, the jealous care, the exalted portion of the pain and power of love i cannot share, but wear the chain.  but 'tis not thus—and 'tis not here such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now, where glory decks the hero's bier, or binds his brow.  the sword, the banner, and the field, glory and greece around us see! the spartan borne upon his shield was not more free.  awake (not greece—she is awake!) awake, my spirit! think through whom thy life-blood tracks its parent lake and then strike home!  tread those reviving passions down unworthy manhood—unto thee indifferent should the smile or frown of beauty be.  if thou regret'st thy youth,why live? the land of honourable death is here:—up to the field, and give away thy breath!  seek out—less often sought than found— a soldier's grave, for thee the best; then look around, and choose thy ground, and take thy rest.

 from the dim hallway, walls swollen with summer damp.  concave threshold to the morning’s livid light.  when my father said gerrard street east, his voice.  the passing subway tremors upwards, into me, reverberates in  ligaments and membranes.  on canvas shoes through minor parks, a pinball in a rudderless machine.  my father, transiently animate. funny in the ebbing language,  bantering with shopkeepers.  a lifeguard pours bleach in the fractured blue wading pool, sloshes it out with her legs.  if  i could, i’d view a produce stand as he did, fill a paper bag with dillweed, bitter melon, ladyfingers.  miraculous reversal poster in the window of the portuguese  apothecary.  who lived where he never resembled somebody.  belled, metal restaurant elephant. they’re barely open. the woman fills and seals samosas in the uproar of a standing fan.  i have tea. father, dayflower, i keep arriving at this dead end where the menu says exotic, stamped with sickle chilis.  the fan blades clatter frantically in their cage. a ghetto blaster spools ghazals.  her husband, over the counter, shouts:the pavements here are very bad. you must take your walks on the pitch, in circles. this is what all of us do.

 just tell me who the hell am i? what powers did i, do i hold? what right have i to say “my” or “mine” or “me” — all honey- glazed, all bullet-proofed and worshipful of any gangster “i”?  the key to the dollar store hangs on my belt. yes, “my” again. and what of roof, of bread, of loving laughter? what’s in? my vinyl favorite booker little, vintage, soothes me. he jars our ears with trumpet joy and stuff freed folks stash in cabinets.  never one to make too much of why we love and what, i love my powers. i might put you in my will.

 to these i turn, in these i trust— brother lead and sister steel. to his blind power i make appeal, i guard her beauty clean from rust.  he spins and burns and loves the air, and splits a skull to win my praise; but up the nobly marching days she glitters naked, cold and fair.  sweet sister, grant your soldier this: that in good fury he may feel the body where he sets his heel quail from your downward darting kiss.

 from over the wall i could hear the laughter of women in a foreign tongue, in the sun-rinsed air of the city. they sat (so i thought) perfumed in their hats and their silks,  in chairs on the grass amid flowers glowing and swaying. one spoke and the others rang like bells, oh so witty, like bells till the sound filled up the garden and lifted  like bubbles spilling over the bricks that enclosed them, their happiness holding them, even if just for the moment. although i did not understand a word they were saying,  their sound surrounded me, fell on my shoulders and hair, and burst on my cheeks like kisses, and continued to fall, holding me there where i stood on the sidewalk listening.  as i could not move, i had to hear them grow silent, and adjust myself to the clouds and the cooling air. the mumble of thunder rumbled out of the wall and the smacking of drops as the rain fell everywhere.

 go, soul, the body’s guest, upon a thankless errand; fear not to touch the best; the truth shall be thy warrant. go, since i needs must die, and give the world the lie.  say to the court, it glows and shines like rotten wood; say to the church, it shows what’s good, and doth no good. if church and court reply, then give them both the lie.  tell potentates, they live acting by others’ action; not loved unless they give, not strong but by a faction. if potentates reply, give potentates the lie.  tell men of high condition, that manage the estate, their purpose is ambition, their practice only hate. and if they once reply, then give them all the lie.  tell them that brave it most, they beg for more by spending, who, in their greatest cost, seek nothing but commending. and if they make reply, then give them all the lie.  tell zeal it wants devotion; tell love it is but lust; tell time it is but motion; tell flesh it is but dust. and wish them not reply, for thou must give the lie.  tell age it daily wasteth; tell honor how it alters; tell beauty how she blasteth; tell favor how it falters. and as they shall reply, give every one the lie.  tell wit how much it wrangles in tickle points of niceness; tell wisdom she entangles herself in overwiseness. and when they do reply, straight give them both the lie.  tell physic of her boldness; tell skill it is pretension; tell charity of coldness; tell law it is contention. and as they do reply, so give them still the lie.  tell fortune of her blindness; tell nature of decay; tell friendship of unkindness; tell justice of delay. and if they will reply, then give them all the lie.  tell arts they have no soundness, but vary by esteeming; tell schools they want profoundness, and stand too much on seeming. if arts and schools reply, give arts and schools the lie.  tell faith it’s fled the city; tell how the country erreth; tell manhood shakes off pity; tell virtue least preferreth. and if they do reply, spare not to give the lie.  so when thou hast, as i commanded thee, done blabbing— although to give the lie deserves no less than stabbing— stab at thee he that will, no stab the soul can kill.

 it doesn’t bother me to have lint in the bottoms of pant pockets; it gives the hands something to do, especially since i no longer hold shovel, hod, or hammer in the daylight hours of labor and haven’t, in fact, done so in twenty-five years. a long time to be picking lint from pockets. perhaps even long enough to have gathered sacks full of lint that could have been put to good use, maybe spun into yarn to knit a sweater for my wife’s christmas present, or strong thread whirled and woven into a tweedy jacket. imagine entering my classroom in a jacket made from lint. who would believe it? yet there are stranger things— the son of a bricklayer with hands so smooth they’re only fit for picking lint.

NEW POEM
 a satire upon the true-blue protestant poet t.s. all human things are subject to decay, and, when fate summons, monarchs must obey: this flecknoe found, who, like augustus, young was call'd to empire, and had govern'd long: in prose and verse, was own'd, without dispute through all the realms of non-sense, absolute. this aged prince now flourishing in peace, and blest with issue of a large increase, worn out with business, did at length debate to settle the succession of the state: and pond'ring which of all his sons was fit to reign, and wage immortal war with wit; cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that he should only rule, who most resembles me: shadwell alone my perfect image bears, mature in dullness from his tender years. shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he who stands confirm'd in full stupidity. the rest to some faint meaning make pretence, but shadwell never deviates into sense. some beams of wit on other souls may fall, strike through and make a lucid interval; but shadwell's genuine night admits no ray, his rising fogs prevail upon the day: besides his goodly fabric fills the eye, and seems design'd for thoughtless majesty: thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain, and, spread in solemn state, supinely reign. heywood and shirley were but types of thee, thou last great prophet of tautology: even i, a dunce of more renown than they, was sent before but to prepare thy way; and coarsely clad in norwich drugget came to teach the nations in thy greater name. my warbling lute, the lute i whilom strung when to king john of portugal i sung, was but the prelude to that glorious day, when thou on silver thames did'st cut thy way, with well tim'd oars before the royal barge, swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge; and big with hymn, commander of an host, the like was ne'er in epsom blankets toss'd. methinks i see the new arion sail, the lute still trembling underneath thy nail. at thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shore the treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar: echoes from pissing-alley, shadwell call, and shadwell they resound from aston hall. about thy boat the little fishes throng, as at the morning toast, that floats along. sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band thou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand. st. andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time, not ev'n the feet of thy own psyche's rhyme: though they in number as in sense excel; so just, so like tautology they fell, that, pale with envy, singleton forswore the lute and sword which he in triumph bore and vow'd he ne'er would act villerius more. here stopt the good old sire; and wept for joy in silent raptures of the hopeful boy. all arguments, but most his plays, persuade, that for anointed dullness he was made.  close to the walls which fair augusta bind, (the fair augusta much to fears inclin'd) an ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight, there stood of yore, and barbican it hight: a watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains, of all the pile an empty name remains. from its old ruins brothel-houses rise, scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys. where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep, and, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep. near these a nursery erects its head, where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred; where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry, where infant punks their tender voices try, and little maximins the gods defy. great fletcher never treads in buskins here, nor greater jonson dares in socks appear; but gentle simkin just reception finds amidst this monument of vanish'd minds: pure clinches, the suburbian muse affords; and panton waging harmless war with words. here flecknoe, as a place to fame well known, ambitiously design'd his shadwell's throne. for ancient decker prophesi'd long since, that in this pile should reign a mighty prince, born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense: to whom true dullness should some psyches owe, but worlds of misers from his pen should flow; humorists and hypocrites it should produce, whole raymond families, and tribes of bruce.  now empress fame had publisht the renown, of shadwell's coronation through the town. rous'd by report of fame, the nations meet, from near bun-hill, and distant watling-street. no persian carpets spread th'imperial way, but scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay: from dusty shops neglected authors come, martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum. much heywood, shirley, ogleby there lay, but loads of shadwell almost chok'd the way. bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd, and herringman was captain of the guard. the hoary prince in majesty appear'd, high on a throne of his own labours rear'd. at his right hand our young ascanius sat rome's other hope, and pillar of the state. his brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace, and lambent dullness play'd around his face. as hannibal did to the altars come, sworn by his sire a mortal foe to rome; so shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain, that he till death true dullness would maintain; and in his father's right, and realm's defence, ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense. the king himself the sacred unction made, as king by office, and as priest by trade: in his sinister hand, instead of ball, he plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale; love's kingdom to his right he did convey, at once his sceptre and his rule of sway; whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young, and from whose loins recorded psyche sprung, his temples last with poppies were o'er spread, that nodding seem'd to consecrate his head: just at that point of time, if fame not lie, on his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly. so romulus, 'tis sung, by tiber's brook, presage of sway from twice six vultures took. th'admiring throng loud acclamations make, and omens of his future empire take. the sire then shook the honours of his head, and from his brows damps of oblivion shed full on the filial dullness: long he stood, repelling from his breast the raging god; at length burst out in this prophetic mood:  heavens bless my son, from ireland let him reign to far barbadoes on the western main; of his dominion may no end be known, and greater than his father's be his throne. beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen; he paus'd, and all the people cry'd amen. then thus, continu'd he, my son advance still in new impudence, new ignorance. success let other teach, learn thou from me pangs without birth, and fruitless industry. let virtuosos in five years be writ; yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit. let gentle george in triumph tread the stage, make dorimant betray, and loveit rage; let cully, cockwood, fopling, charm the pit, and in their folly show the writer's wit. yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence, and justify their author's want of sense. let 'em be all by thy own model made of dullness, and desire no foreign aid: that they to future ages may be known, not copies drawn, but issue of thy own. nay let thy men of wit too be the same, all full of thee, and differing but in name; but let no alien sedley interpose to lard with wit thy hungry epsom prose. and when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull, trust nature, do not labour to be dull; but write thy best, and top; and in each line, sir formal's oratory will be thine. sir formal, though unsought, attends thy quill, and does thy northern dedications fill. nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame, by arrogating jonson's hostile name. let father flecknoe fire thy mind with praise, and uncle ogleby thy envy raise. thou art my blood, where jonson has no part; what share have we in nature or in art? where did his wit on learning fix a brand, and rail at arts he did not understand? where made he love in prince nicander's vein, or swept the dust in psyche's humble strain? where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse, promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce? when did his muse from fletcher scenes purloin, as thou whole eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine? but so transfus'd as oil on waters flow, his always floats above, thine sinks below. this is thy province, this thy wondrous way, new humours to invent for each new play: this is that boasted bias of thy mind, by which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd, which makes thy writings lean on one side still, and in all changes that way bends thy will. nor let thy mountain belly make pretence of likeness; thine's a tympany of sense. a tun of man in thy large bulk is writ, but sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit. like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep, thy tragic muse gives smiles, thy comic sleep. with whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write, thy inoffensive satires never bite. in thy felonious heart, though venom lies, it does but touch thy irish pen, and dies. thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame in keen iambics, but mild anagram: leave writing plays, and choose for thy command some peaceful province in acrostic land. there thou may'st wings display and altars raise, and torture one poor word ten thousand ways. or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit, set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute. he said, but his last words were scarcely heard, for bruce and longvil had a trap prepar'd, and down they sent the yet declaiming bard. sinking he left his drugget robe behind, born upwards by a subterranean wind. the mantle fell to the young prophet's part, with double portion of his father's art.

 1  in which i try to decipher the story it tells, this syntax of monuments flanking the old courthouse: here, a rough outline like the torso of a woman great with child— a steatite boulder from which the indians girdled the core to make of it a bowl, and left in the stone a wound; here,  the bronze figure of thomas jefferson, quill in hand, inscribing a language of freedom, a creation story— his hand poised at the word happiness. there is not yet an ending, no period—the single mark, intended or misprinted, that changes the meaning of everything.  here too, for the confederacy, an obelisk, oblivious in its name—a word that also meant the symbol to denote, in ancient manuscripts, the spurious,corrupt,or doubtful; at its base, forged in concrete, a narrative of valor,virtue,states' rights.  here, it is only the history of a word, obelisk, that points us toward what's not there; all of it palimpsest, each mute object repeating a single refrain:  remember this.

 four-fifty. the palings of trinity church burying ground, a few inches above the earth, are sunk in green light. the low stones like pale books knocked sideways. the bus so close to the curb that brush-drops of ebony paint stand out wetly, the sunlight seethes with vibrations, the sidewalks on whitehall shudder with subterranean tremors. overhead, faint flickers  crackle down the window-paths: limpid telegraphy of the late afternoon july thunderstorm unfurling over manhattan. its set and luminous velocity, long stalks of stormlight, and then the first drops strike their light civic stripes on the pavement. between the palings, oat-panicles sift a few bright grains to the stonecourse. above it, at shoulder height a side door is flung open, fire-exits; streaming from lobbies  come girls and women, white girls in shadowy-striped rayon skirts, plastic ear-hoops, black girls in gauzy-toned nylons, ripples of cornrows and plaits, one girl with shocked-back ash hair, lightened eyebrows; one face from easter island, mauve and granitic; thigh on thigh, waist by waist; the elbow’s curlicue and the fingers’; elbow-work, heel-work, are suddenly absorbed in the corduroyed black rubber stairs of the bus. humid sighs, settlings, each face tilts up to the windows’ shadowless yards of mercuric green plate glass. an interspace then, like the slowing of some rural water-mill, a creaking and dipping pause of black-splintered paddles, the irregularly dappled off-lighting—bottle-green—the lucid slim sluice falling back in a stream from the plank edge. it won’t take us altogether, we say, the mill-race—it won’t churn us up altogether. we’ll keep a glib stretch of leisure water, like our self’s self—to reflect the sky. but we won’t (says the bus rider now to herself). nothing’s left over, really, from labor. they’ve taken it all for the mill-race.  in close-ups now, you can see it in every face, despite the roped rain light pouring down the bus-windows— it’s the strain of gravity itself, of life hours cut off and offered to the voice that says “give me this day your life, that is labor, and i’ll give you back one day, then another. for mine are the terms.” it’s gravity, spilling in capillaries, cheek-tissue trembling, despite the make-up, the monograms, the mass-market designer scarves,  the army of signs disowning the workplace and longing for night ... but even as the rain slackens, labor lengthens itself along broadway. the night signs come on, that wit has set up to draw money: o’donnell’s, beirut cafe, yonah’s knish

 see, it’s a kind of crime scene, as if the mind were a dime novel, a scrim of need and semen, all cinder and siren, a dim prison where the miser dines on rinds of desire, and the sinner, sincere as denim, repeats eden’s demise — that luckless toss of dice. yet here at the rim of this demesne a mitigating mise-en-scène: a close-up of her mother stirring rice, a glass of sparkling cider, a mince pie spliced in — not to rescind or mend: what mind denies mercies mine in the end.

 his last composed poem, "over my head," closes with the evening tide coming in as the light fails over brighton beach.  in the years of the great plague, he lived with his mother and brother and wrote the elegies that remain unpublished,  under the eaves in an unfinished room above his mother's late-night television vigil. he wrote to a ghostly laugh-track  in the night. though he cut out and saved lurid, five-color magazine pictures of the south pacific, the aegean; though  he hoped for a winter crossing by steamer until his final weakness set in, underneath he was a city boy  whose poems drifted like a dinghy in small inlets—gravesend, rockaway— out too far for safety, in sight of land.

 in 1965 my parents broke two laws of mississippi; they went to ohio to marry, returned to mississippi.  they crossed the river into cincinnati, a city whose name begins with a sound like sin, the sound of wrong—mis in mississippi.  a year later they moved to canada, followed a route the same as slaves, the train slicing the white glaze of winter, leaving mississippi.  faulkner’s joe christmas was born in winter, like jesus, given his name for the day he was left at the orphanage, his race unknown in mississippi.  my father was reading war and peace when he gave me my name. i was born near easter, 1966, in mississippi.  when i turned 33 my father said,it’s your jesus year—you’re the same age he was when he died. it was spring, the hills green in mississippi.  i know more than joe christmas did. natasha is a russian name— though i’m not; it means christmas child, even in mississippi.

 today the moon sees fit to come between a parched earth and sun, hurrying the premature darkness. a rooster in the yard cuts off its crowing, fooled into momentary sleep. and soon the perseid showers, broken bits of the ancient universe, will pass through the skin of our atmosphere. time and space are alive over our city.  final eclipse of the sun, last of this millennium, our city’s brightness broken off. we have known other dark hours: here, coffin that slowly passes, i give you my sprig of lilac— lincoln’s death, winding procession toward sleep. we have known slave coffles and holding pens in yards not half a mile from our capitol, wooden palings sunk in earth  to guarantee none would escape. in this freest city. oh if earth could talk. earth does talk in the neatly framed yards where death thinks to lay us down to rest. asleep, the marker stones. but not the voices, jagged bits of memory, shards of poems. sterling brown. our human possessions and all they've left us. this whole city  sings their songs. say their names. in this city they are our monuments: frederick douglass, our rayford logan, alain locke, franklin frazier, georgia douglas johnson, paul laurence dunbar, may miller: not sleep but garlands left to us. montague cobb, william hastie. yards of names. and here, the place where we unearth  an immigrant father of seven. he leans down—no earthly reason for his choice—to pick up his nearest child. a yard-long rack of brooms behind him, a bin of apples. not the sleep of cold, but autumn in washington. 1913 or a bit later. he stands awkwardly on 4 1/2 street, s. w. our street photographer, who’s just come by with his city  chatter, ducks beneath a dark cloth. monuments of the city behind him, he leans over his black box camera in time to capture that moment when the child will play her bit part, pushing away from her father like a boat from shore. in the sleep of winter, years later, she will become my mother. what yardstick by which to measure importance? to measure earthly  agency? each of us has monuments in the bone case of memory. earth- bound, i take my sac of marble and carry it down lonely city streets where our generals on horseback and a tall bearded man keep watch over all their citizens.  
NEW POEM
 finding myself in a mesmeric orientation, before me appeared benjamin franklin, who magnetized his french paramours at dinner parties as an amusing diversion from his most serious studies of electricity and the ethereal fire. i like thinking about how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp and clap for the blue spark between them. i believe in an honest and forthright manner, a democracy of plain speech, so i have to find a way to explain i don’t care to have sex anymore. once i was a high school teacher and there was a boy who everyday came in late, who only came to school at all to sell drugs out of his backpack, upon which he laid his head like a pillow and closed his eyes while i pointed at a chart diagramming the anatomy of a sparrow. the vice principal was watching and taking notes as i taught this class, so i slid the bag from under his cheek, as if not to wake him, wrapped his fingers around a pen. i was trying to be a gentle mother and also trying to show i was in control of an unstable situation. the boy, also trying to be in control of himself, walked so slow to my desk and we stood to watch him push everything—binders, piles of ungraded papers, a beaker of red pens to the floor. he was so calm.how do you like it when i touch your things. i do not like it. i live in a house with many blue mason jars, each containing a feather collection or starfish collection or vertebrae collection, and also there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton. each window is pressed by the design of a sweet-gum branch, all the little orange and red stars of its leaves, you can’t see the perfect geometry this close, just haphazard parabolas, but beneath the foundation the roots mirror the branching. i have a chart of this to pull down. the view is flat and so quiet on the inside. have i been forthright yet? what i want to know is what happens if i decide to never have sex again? or more precisely, can i decide to not have sex again and still be kind? and be a joy to others? i should mention i am a wife. i should mention i was told my sole purpose is to be joy to others. the sidewalks outside are very full of people and when i look at them i feel hopeless. benjamin franklin was so jolly with his kite and his key and his scandalous electricity. he was so in love with women and drink and democracy. before i was this way, i was not a house, i was just a jar and what i wanted was to be broken. a cool trick you can do that i once showed a class is crank a wheel covered in felt against another felt wheel. static bristles and sparks and makes your hair stand on end . but hook it to a leyden jar and the electricity fills up in there, invisible as air. becomes a glass battery, until you too much the thing, then wow! broken glass everywhere. i remember wanting that. do i have to always want that? my house is blue and quiet. i can hardly hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles: “a house full, a hole full, but you cannot gather a bowl full.” the air of everywhere is wet with electric fluid, you can’t even tell, but pop, whiz, everywhere. “in this field,” ben says, “the soul has room enough to expand, to display all of her extravagances.” the sweet gum has 10,000 sticky, spiky seed balls. they start green but grow black and fall for want of a barren season. they look like sea urchins. i call them tree urchins and think it’s a funny joke. i don’t tell it to anyone, as i am tired of being told what is not. such a secret, i know, is an extravagance, and i like best how it’s an extravagance so small you must keep it in a jar with others of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all.

 a peacock on an olive branch looks beyond the grove to the road, beyond the road to the sea, blank-lit, where a sailboat anchors to a cove. as it is morning, below deck a man is pouring water into a cup, listening to the radio-talk of the ships: barges dead in the calms awaiting port call, pleasure boats whose lights hours ago went out, fishermen setting their nets for mullet, as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines, whisper smoke into wood ovens, sweep the terraces clear of night, putting the music out with morning light, and for the breath of an hour it is possible to consider the waters of this sea wine-dark, to remember that there was no word for blue among the ancients, but there was the whirring sound before the oars of the great triremes sang out of the seam of world, through pine-sieved winds silvered by salt flats until they were light enough to pass for breath from the heavens, troubled enough to fell ships and darken thought — then as now the clouds pass, roosters sleep in their huts, the sea flattens under glass air, but there is nothing to hold us there: not the quiet of marble nor the luff of sail, fields of thyme, a vineyard at harvest, and the sea filled with the bones of those in flight from wars east and south, our wars, their remains scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves, belongings now a flotsam washed to the rocks. stand here and look into the distant haze, there where the holy mountain with its thousand monks wraps itself in shawls of rain, then look to the west, where the rubber boats tipped into the tough waves. rest your eyes there, remembering the words of anacreon, himself a refugee of war, who appears in the writings of herodotus: i love and do not love, i am mad and i am not mad. like you he thought himself not better, nor worse than anyone else.  
NEW POEM
 the style a form of concealment the way style is. his manners seemed a parody, almost, of manners, a movie star of bygone days;  strangely elaborate, highly stylized manners, complicit with his fame and with your praise; looking toward you and then away from you,  star-like, movie-star-like, a dance routine, the walk almost a glide, or elegant shuffle, always on the verge of veering away,  circling away and over to the other side of the frozen skating arena that he was on; a dancer’s courtesy, the courtesy,  i mean, of the dancer to the audience, flirtatious and familiar, only for you, and entirely impersonal and withheld.  all of the above, though, maybe, misses the point, because it seems to say he knew about what he was doing or what the style was for,  and nothing let one be sure that this was so; a look on his face of amusement, as if he knew a secret that he shared with you and yet  kept to himself, as if it only showed the cryptogram but wouldn’t provide the key to read it with. but could he read the code?  one night, late at night, as we were driving home from having had dinner out, in boston, we saw him figure skating through charles street circle,  right through and among the circling lights of cars as if with champion skill on thin ice whirling oblivious to the astonished blaring horns,  as a dancer or skater seems, while dancing to the music that we hear, oblivious to the music that we hear and listening to  some other music heard from somewhere else. so peter moved like a dancer or skater through and among the dangerous outraged cars as if  untouchable and untouched and moving to the sounds of something else from somewhere else— the music maybe of his madness was it?  it was as if he skated in solitude and glided whirling on a lonely tarn far out away from everything there is.

 on the tip of a hill, the silhouette is of something not of this world, the body silent in the birth of another shadow, swelling still  among stars &amp; veins. the sun dropping below the mountains left hardly any light, except what glimmers on the membrane &amp; slips  into the high grass. alone, i pulled over to the side of 81 where semis’ blowing horns descend  beyond the sloped field. pieces of barbed wire snapped from the line. i stepped through the fence, its blood-colored rust rubbed into my hands.  for a moment, it is something that stays with me, like a memory that does not give up easily. i try wiping my hands onto my jeans, but nothing.  it is anything it wants to be—calf, half-life, angel—its fur a glaze of cricket sounds &amp; cool air, a thing of stars burnt into hooves, a haze,  &amp; i stood there, not knowing whether it would be right to touch the one not breathing, its nose drying in the grass next to my hands, grit  in the creases &amp; burning now with the dust of splinters. like flies, my fingers hover over the dead face.

 the year i was born the atomic bomb went off. here i'd just begun, and someone found the switch to turn off the world.  in the furnace-light, in the central solar fire of that heat lamp, the future got very finite, and it was possible to imagine time-travelers  failing to arrive, because there was no future. inside the great dark clock in the hall, heavy brass cylinders descended.  tick-tock, the chimes changed their tune one phrase at a time. the bomb became a film star, its glamorous globe of smoke  searing the faces of men in beach chairs. someone threw up every day at school. no time to worry about collective death,  when life itself was permeated by ordeals. and so we grew up, beneath an umbrella of acceptance. in bio we learned there were particles  cruising through us like whales through archipelagoes, and in civics that if hitler had gotten the bomb he'd have used it on the inferior races,  and all this time love was etching its scars on our skins like maps. the heavens remained pure, except for little white slits  on the perfect blue skin that planes cut in the icy upper air, like needles sewing. from one, a tiny seed might fall  that would make a sun on earth. and so the century passed, with me still in it, books waiting on the shelves to become cinders,  what we felt locked up inside, waiting to be read, down the long corridor of time. i was born the year the bomb exploded. twice  whole cities were charred like cities in the bible, but we didn't look back. we went on thinking we could go on, our shapes the same,  darkened now against a background lit by fire. forgive me for doubting you're there, citizens, on your holodecks with earth wallpaper—  a shadow-toned ancestor with poorly pressed pants, protected like a child from knowing the future.

(these follicles don’t surf; don’t swim)  but here in virginia, there’s little comfort. the blush current from underwater springs makes me tense.  white people form groups to paddle on boards across the hudson, taking on trends from hawai’i. they tap into the yesterdays of algonquian tongues. wappinger. mohican.  a sporty new aged (like gouda) convenience. a luxury to admire when long beach is too far and rockaway too dirty.  black folk don’t swim. we splash and cool off. we a ways forward from a splenda hint of senegalese manliness diving from a ferry, miles off shore from gor é e. that water got too much memory. we much prefer chlorine. that salt and fresh water our hypertension.  and that ocean is curiously scary. and this lake is charmed and churning with tales from the deep.  profound is this river of b-rated torture. deep are shadow people speculated through my rave tangerine goggles.  on lake champlain at night, the chilly air felt like a presence. swamp monsters (this ain’t a swamp). tubular amphibians (they’d be in rivers). aquatic reptilians. ancestors distraught and vengeful (like jason).  but this is smaller and gnawing like chiggers; something from my weed days could live. down. here.  my arms fight the green clearness. so mud olive i cannot see the bottom. beneath me is crisp. a fallen branch is mistaken for an eel.

 to cure myself of wanting cuban songs, i wrote a cuban song about the need for people to suppress their fantasies, especially unhealthy ones. the song began by making reference to the sea, because the sea is like a need so great and deep it never can be swallowed. then the song explores some common myths about the cuban people and their folklore: the story of a little carib boy mistakenly abandoned to the sea; the legend of a bird who wanted song so desperately he gave up flight; a queen whose strength was greater than a rival king’s. the song goes on about morality, and then there is a line about the sea, how deep it is, how many creatures need its nourishment, how beautiful it is to need. the song is ending now, because i cannot bear to hear it any longer. i call this song of needful love my voice.

 even if you love the racket of ascension, you must know how the power leaves you. and at this pitch who has time for meditation? the sea walled in by buildings. i do miss the quiet, don't you? when i said, "fuck the deer antlered and hithered in fur," it was because i had seen the faces of presidents balled into a fist. if i were in charge, i would know how to fix the world: free health care or free physicals, at least, and an abiding love for the abstract. when i said, "all of history is saved for us," it was because i scorned the emancipated sky. does the anthem choke you up? when i asked god if anyone born to slaves would die a slave, he said: "sure as a rock descending a hillside." that's why i'm not a christian.

 her hair back from the wide round face flows, almost a girl’s, so thick, caught back in combs, racing and curling through them with blackest vigor, although it is pure white. cracked face, dusk-colored: not red but with a deep red struggling under the coming night. the eyes shift quickly, the subway train jerks and rattles, green vinyl, light flickering, silver poles. eyes driven from ancient calm, which may fear but is never frantic and says nothing, such as looks out from the old indian portraits—calm is the one thing missing from the beauty of her face in the black window. those unresting eyes there talk plainly: there’s no money at home, men young and old go wrong, life almost at its end is still day by day harried and perplexed.

 a man hauling coal in the street is stilled forever. inside a temple, instead of light  a slow shutter lets the darkness in. i see a rat turn a corner running from a man with a chair trying to smash it,  see people sleeping at midnight in a wuhan street on bamboo beds, a dead pig floating, bloated, on water.  i see a photograph of a son smiling who two years ago fell off a cliff and his photograph is in each room of the apartment.  i meet a woman who had smallpox as a child, was abandoned by her mother but who lived, now has two daughters, a son, a son-in-law;  they live in three rooms and watch a color television. i see a man in blue work clothes whose father was a peasant  who joined the communist party early but by the time of the cultural revolution had risen in rank and become a target of the red guards.  i see a woman who tried to kill herself with an acupuncture needle but instead hit a vital point and cured her chronic asthma.  a chinese poet argues that the fundamental difference between east and west is that in the east an individual does not believe himself  in control of his fate but yields to it. as a negative reverses light and dark  these words are prose accounts of personal tragedy becoming metaphor, an emulsion of silver salts sensitive to light,  laughter in the underground bomb shelter converted into a movie theater, lovers in the summer palace park.

 1  one night in april or may, his daughter saw someone's hand make the curtain which was drawn tightly across her window bulge and ran to the adjoining room in her night clothes where he and his son were sitting. he ran around the house one way and his son ran the other way and they found a negro under a workbench within six or eight feet of the window holding a piece of plank before his face— begging them not to shoot.  2  the negro was dead when the doctors examined him. they found upon his belly bruises: he died, the doctor said, of peritonitis.  the jailer testified that the negro had been brought to the jail charged with burglary; but no warrant for his arrest was produced and the jailer did not know—or tell— who brought him. the negro said that a crowd of men had taken him from a store to the woods and whipped him with "a buggy trace."  he was not treated by a doctor, the jailer, or anybody: just put into the jail and left there to die. the doctor who saw him first—on a monday— did nothing for him and said that he would not die of a his beating; but he did die of it on wednesday.

 the truth is, i’ve never cared for the national anthem. if you think about it, it’s not a good song. too high for most of us with “the rockets red glare” and then there are the bombs. (always, always, there is war and bombs.) once, i sang it at homecoming and threw even the tenacious high school band off key. but the song didn’t mean anything, just a call to the field, something to get through before the pummeling of youth. and what of the stanzas we never sing, the third that mentions “no refuge could save the hireling and the slave”? perhaps, the truth is, every song of this country has an unsung third stanza, something brutal snaking underneath us as we blindly sing the high notes with a beer sloshing in the stands hoping our team wins. don’t get me wrong, i do like the flag, how it undulates in the wind like water, elemental, and best when it’s humbled, brought to its knees, clung to by someone who has lost everything, when it’s not a weapon, when it flickers, when it folds up so perfectly you can keep it until it’s needed, until you can love it again, until the song in your mouth feels like sustenance, a song where the notes are sung by even the ageless woods, the short-grass plains, the red river gorge, the fistful of land left unpoisoned, that song that’s our birthright, that’s sung in silence when it’s too hard to go on, that sounds like someone’s rough fingers weaving into another’s, that sounds like a match being lit in an endless cave, the song that says my bones are your bones, and your bones are my bones, and isn’t that enough?

 roadlight licks the night ahead, licks the white line on night’s new hide, licks the undulating blacktop flat, sticks its end- less forking tongue out onward, flicks itself at culvert, tree, passing truck, a sign insisting heartbeats equal conscious life (it may be) of someone’s (maybe my) forever unborn child. i let the knife of wind inside and sing a whiter shade of pale, no earthly reason why, and think of what won’t be and who, and whether it be speed, wind, song, or my mind’s roar that drowns for once time’s slangy whine, here comes hope to climb clear of before; stillborn hope with desperate, moro-reflex, undead grip climbs right back up my neck, raising each pointless, residual nape hair in ancestral salute to an absence, to the air that won’t question itself, won’t ever check the moral rearview. i accelerate gamely, wondering what makes me want to leave each person, place and thing i learn to love. what shoves me off again, racing insanely, as if to the place that will always save a place for me, a room that will contain the kind of people who’d embrace the things i’m still afraid i’m still afraid to face.  
NEW POEM
 when i brood on germany in the night no hope for sleep. i know i'll lie awake with my eyes wide open while tears scald my cheeks.  the years are a blur of past and future: a good twelve of them have passed since i last laid eyes on my mother—which may be why i'm in such a frenzy to see her.  and i am desperate with desire. i am under the old mutter's spell. she circles my mind like a ring of fire. i hope to god she is alive and well.  she loves me to pieces, the old woman, and when in her letters her script breaks down, i know she's shaken to her depths, i know when the mother in her's shocked by her role.  my mother never leaves my mental space free of time past, the twelve long years, twelve! —that vanished without a trace since our last satisfying hug and kiss.  don't worry about germany: it's the picture of health. it will outlast us. all and all. i'll know its borders again by the flare of its barbarous oaks and lime-trees' salute.  i wouldn't waste a moment thinking on germany were it not for my mother...; fatherland-is-forever; but the old woman, being mortal, may soon grow...cold.  since i left the country death has taken many i loved. and now the unbreathing impinge too much upon my sympathy. numbering the dead does me in.  and yet i feel compelled to count and each body added to the tally has a say in how my mourning grows: hordes of corpses crush my chest. what—relief—when they...give way.  praise the lord. and the lighter light of france that through this window breaks as my wife, well- tempered, radiant as dawn, dispels my german burden with her lovely smile.  after heinrich heine  
NEW POEM
 this year, till late in april, the snow fell thick and light: thy truce-flag, friendly nature, in clinging drifts of white, hung over field and city: now everywhere is seen, in place of that white quietness, a sudden glow of green.  the verdure climbs the common, beneath the leafless trees, to where the glorious stars and stripes are floating on the breeze. there, suddenly as spring awoke from winter’s snow-draped gloom, the passion-flower of seventy-six is bursting into bloom.  dear is the time of roses, when earth to joy is wed, and garden-plot and meadow wear one generous flush of red; but now in dearer beauty, to her ancient colors true, blooms the old town of boston in red and white and blue.  along the whole awakening north are those bright emblems spread; a summer noon of patriotism is burning overhead: no party badges flaunting now, no word of clique or clan; but “up for god and union!” is the shout of every man.  oh, peace is dear to northern hearts; our hard-earned homes more dear; but freedom is beyond the price of any earthly cheer; and freedom’s flag is sacred; he who would work it harm, let him, although a brother, beware our strong right arm!  a brother! ah, the sorrow, the anguish of that word! the fratricidal strife begun, when will its end be heard? not this the boon that patriot hearts have prayed and waited for;— we loved them, and we longed for peace: but they would have it war.  yes; war! on this memorial day, the day of lexington, a lightning-thrill along the wires from heart to heart has run. brave men we gazed on yesterday, to-day for us have bled: again is massachusetts blood the first for freedom shed.  to war,—and with our brethren, then,—if only this can be! life hangs as nothing in the scale against dear liberty! though hearts be torn asunder, for freedom we will fight: our blood may seal the victory, but god will shield the right!  
NEW POEM
 we had to imagine you even then, ramon, your star lost, a glimpse to die for, all the kids galloping to westside park where your gang was supposed to meet in open warfare those bitter skinny boys from toonerville, well-armed, lupe said. and when we got there, nothing, no armies, no chucos with long tails and zip guns, just the grass with its stunned look, as though it never really wanted all that light. city grass doesn't want much of anything, it's not out there trembling with desire, minds its own business, leeching slowly upward from busted pipe. and now nobody knows what you really wanted, ramon, when the needle spun true north, or why that final rush of light, flat stare of lawn as you staggered by, seared your own throat shut. tonight, i'm getting to the smallest place i know, dusk coming on slow, the moon half full of shade, so still it almost doesn't want to move, whispers a phrase to particles of blue. same moon you knew with its white mind watching, same moon you walked beneath and were gone.  
NEW POEM
 there  is a  sorceress in our night.  a  sky  that  only  moves  memory to make place  for  the  mangoes of last month.  there is an old man who says,libéremoi.  and  means,  take  everything   but  my  blackness.  only  in the dark do doves  find   reason.  only  in  the  dark  do  doves  have  reason to believe that vengeance  is  light  hanging  on  fallen  tree.  after each  fall, we  ask, where is the   island,   the  sugarcane  that  disappeared  in  our hunger,  the  water that emptied  our  thirst,  the  song   that  robbed  our  nightmare?   they  mock  us. they  tell  us to  whisper in their ears.  they will obey.  but  curses  beat  the air wild.  the air is faint.  and they tell us,stop plotting fire. you are in the wrongland even if the roosters recognize you. they hated our black. what they didn't understand is that it illuminates their world.  
NEW POEM
 a king did not die, a president was not acquitted, a balloon did not fly around the world in twenty days, at 84 with white hair, joe dimaggio was not mourned. and air strikes launched street to street in order to bring peace, or a doctor convicted of doctoring death? no, and no, nothing happened, except flowers purple the year before bloomed white, but no viruses named after women spread across the globe, and the word “columbine” did not enter the consciousness of a nation. what about the bomb that made a mistake, or the famous son of a famous president mistaking the ocean for the sky? that year, the weather was unpredictable, that happened, and if anything else did, like shots fired at people praying, no one heard them, and if people prayed for war to become holy, those prayers went unanswered. in turkey, the ground split open and the 17,000 who would die, let’s say, miraculously, they did not, not in 1999, the year two lifelong enemies shook hands and said there will be peace, but their palms never touched, why lie about that? let’s say the child from cuba arrived not an orphan but with his mother, who loved and did not sink into the sea. let’s not talk about rampages, disasters, conflicts or coupes that never ruined a perfectly good year during which the sun shined on the moon, the earth, and six billion who, for once, got everything right and not a single thing wrong.  
NEW POEM
 another year!—another deadly blow! another mighty empire overthrown! and we are left, or shall be left, alone; the last that dare to struggle with the foe. 'tis well! from this day forward we shall know that in ourselves our safety must be sought; that by our own right hands it must be wrought; that we must stand unpropped, or be laid low. o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer! we shall exult, if they who rule the land be men who hold its many blessings dear, wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band, who are to judge of danger which they fear, and honour which they do not understand.

 o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done, the ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won, the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting, while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; but o heart! heart! heart! o the bleeding drops of red, where on the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead.  o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells; rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills, for you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding, for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; here captain! dear father! this arm beneath your head! it is some dream that on the deck, you’ve fallen cold and dead.  my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, the ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; exult o shores, and ring o bells! but i with mournful tread, walk the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead.

 what if the ability to capture emblems in the wild won’t validate us?  what if displaying our embarrassing flaws won’t save us —  say being dead but kittenish?  •  i can’t show you anything new, not even  an empty room behind a velvet rope.  least of all that!  there’s a lexus spinning in a parking lot  because a mountain road is “so cliché.”  it’s throwing up dust, then more, but you know the car’s  still in there somewhere,  still voguing

NEW POEM
 four white heifers with sprawling hooves trundle the waggon. its ill-roped crates heavy with fruit sway. the chisel point of the goad, blue and white, glitters ahead, a flame to follow lance-high in a man’s hand who does not shave. his linen trousers like him want washing. you can see his baked skin through his shirt. he has no shoes and his hat has a hole in it. ‘hu ! vaca ! hu ! vaca !’ he says staccato without raising his voice; ‘adios caballero’ legato but in the same tone. camelmen high on muzzled mounts boots rattling against the panels of an empty packsaddle do not answer strangers. each with his train of seven or eight tied head to tail they pass silent but for the heavy bells and plip of slobber dripping from muzzle to dust; save that on sand their soles squeak slightly. milkmaids, friendly girls between fourteen and twenty or younger, bolt upright on small trotting donkeys that bray (they arch their tails a few inches from the root, stretch neck and jaw forward to make the windpipe a trumpet) chatter. jolted cans clatter. the girls’ smiles repeat the black silk curve of the wimple under the chin. their hats are absurd doll’s hats or flat-crowned to take a load. all have fine eyes. you can guess their balanced nakedness under the cotton gown and thin shift. they sing and laugh. they say ‘adios!’ shyly but look back more than once, knowing our thoughts and sharing our desires and lack of faith in desire.  
NEW POEM
 we have memorized america, how it was born and who we have been and where. in ceremonies and silence we say the words, telling the stories, singing the old songs. we like the places they take us. mostly we do. the great and all the anonymous dead are there. we know the sound of all the sounds we brought. the rich taste of it is on our tongues. but where are we going to be, and why, and who? the disenfranchised dead want to know. we mean to be the people we meant to be, to keep on going where we meant to go.  but how do we fashion the future? who can say how except in the minds of those who will call it now? the children. the children. and how does our garden grow? with waving hands—oh, rarely in a row— and flowering faces. and brambles, that we can no longer allow.  who were many people coming together cannot become one people falling apart. who dreamed for every child an even chance cannot let luck alone turn doorknobs or not. whose law was never so much of the hand as the head cannot let chaos make its way to the heart. who have seen learning struggle from teacher to child cannot let ignorance spread itself like rot. we know what we have done and what we have said, and how we have grown, degree by slow degree, believing ourselves toward all we have tried to become— just and compassionate, equal, able, and free.  all this in the hands of children, eyes already set on a land we never can visit—it isn’t there yet— but looking through their eyes, we can see what our long gift to them may come to be. if we can truly remember, they will not forget.  
NEW POEM
 oh fairest of the rural maids! thy birth was in the forest shades; green boughs, and glimpses of the sky, were all that met thine infant eye.  thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child, were even in the sylvan wild; and all the beauty of the place is in thy heart and on thy face.  the twilight of the trees and rocks is in the light shade of thy locks; thy step is as the wind, that weaves its playful way among the leaves.  thine eyes are springs, in whose serene and silent waters heaven is seen; their lashes are the herbs that look on their young figures in the brook.  the forest depths, by foot unpressed, are not more sinless than thy breast; the holy peace, that fills the air of those calm solitudes, is there.

 for a place i hate, i invoke you often. stockholm’s: i am eight years old and the telephone poles are down, the power plant at the edge of town spitting electricity. before the pickup trucks, the strip malls, dirt beaten by cherokee feet.osiyo, tsilugi. rope swung from mule to tent to man, tornadoes came, the wind rearranged the face of the land like a chessboard. this was before the gold rush, the greed of engines, before white men pressing against brown women, nailing crosses by the river, before the slow songs of cotton plantations, the hymns toward god, the murdered dangling like earrings. under a redwood, two men signed away the land and in history class i don’t understand why a boy whispers sand monkey. the mexican girls let me sit with them as long as i braid their hair, my fingers dipping into that wet black silk. i try to imitate them at home —mírame, mama— but my mother yells at me, says they didn’t come here so i could speak some beggar language. heaven is a long weekend. heaven is a tornado  siren canceling school. heaven is pressed in a pleather booth at the olive garden, sipping pepsi between my gapped teeth, listening to my father mispronounce his meal.  
NEW POEM
 blow back the breath of the bird, scatter the song through the air, there was music you never heard, and cannot hear anywhere.  it was not the sob of the vain in the old, old dark so sweet, (i shall never hear it again,) nor the coming of fairy feet.  it was music and music alone, not a sigh from a lover’s mouth; now it comes in a phantom moan from the dead and buried south.  it was savage and fierce and glad, it played with the heart at will; oh, what a wizard touch it had— oh, if i could hear it still!  were they slaves? they were not then; the music had made them free. they were happy women and men— what more do we care to be?  there is blood and blackness and dust, there are terrible things to see, there are stories of swords that rust, between that music and me.  dark ghosts with your ghostly tunes come back till i laugh through tears; dance under the sunken moons, dance over the grassy years!  hush, hush—i know it, i say; your armies were bright and brave, but the music they took away was worth—whatever they gave.

 'twas mercy brought me from my pagan land, taught my benighted soul to understand that there's a god, that there's a saviour too: once i redemption neither sought nor knew. some view our sable race with scornful eye, "their colour is a diabolic die." remember,christians,negros, black as cain, may be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

 after lockdown, tier by tier undresses to sleep: each skull nestles in its mattress-hollow. wall facing wall inside of wall shrinks to a keyhole: a fly creeps through and starts to buzz, reeling through bars down steel corridors. a dreamer’s eye follows the fly, and wherever the fly lands, the eye touches down with an airier midas touch that turns all to glass: the eye wakes to bentham’s panopticon, glazed cage of an inspection house where only the warden sees all.  —i am asleep and not asleep, i stare up into faces swarming:  cellblocks of memory focus face by face, mine flitting in and out of theirs: in prison issue they come, footsteps mingling over mine in a child’s game of chase from yard to cell, only we’re all grown men, meatier, less and more malign than a boy’s imagining himself grown...  —i was asleep and not asleep, faces came and went.  frank the joker, the west virginia biker, who composed “a rhyme to fit the crime”: “there was a young fellow named frank who gave his girlfriend a spank; she fell in a heap in front of frank’s jeep and old frank ran her down for a prank.”  or the white-haired lifer, densley oracular: “sometimes, after lockdown, your thoughts just don’t have the energy to climb the wall.”  the giggler who bolted his brother in a barn and burned it down, eyes challenging, sly: “they killed this guy and see, i think this is funny, hilarious in fact, but you, you won’t think so—they cut off his dick and shoved it in his mouth.”  or the child molester who said about flowers at funerals: “they’re there, aren’t they, to hide the stink off the corpse?”  or pat, armed robber who held aloof: rolled shirtsleeves, forearms carved from basalt, smoke rings lazily effusing: “the johns here, they got no doors: you ever try to take a shit while someone’s watching? it took six months to get used to that— but here, man, the bars feed on time, they nibble it to nothing.”  —i wanted to sleep and couldn’t sleep, i stared up into faces swarming.  three o’clock dark dissolves the walls, faces start to drift, their atoms mix with concrete’s atomic swirl, bodies get stuck floating halfway through, heartbeats booming as through a stethoscope:  like michaelangelo’s slaves, if a fly landed on their noses, they couldn’t lift a hand to brush it off.  dark velleities buzz in this hive of steel where power handshakes flower in forests of interlocking fingers:  in red prison uniform, a man on death row, convicted 1984, exonerated and pardoned october 2000 (new york times, dec. 10): “you could hear the humming of the chair every time they cut it on, like an air-conditioner cutting on. my daddy came to see me, he said, ‘what's that?’ i said, ‘the chair.’ the way they put it, they got to test the chair.”  —i was asleep and couldn’t wake up.  inside my skull, glass keeps shattering: dream-beings unsubscribed to the will, with insect bodies and human heads, dash against walls, mammal softness of cheeks and lips join with stingers pulsing...my eyes awake and not awake, where is the chamber as in the horror movie return of the fly that, circuitry and test-tubes sparking, would unscramble these divided natures?  (they called me “teach” as in “hey, teach, how do you spell...” when i confessed i’d been in jail, they looked disappointed in me: their side of the wall was theirs, not mine.)  —i tried to turn over, to look away, but couldn’t wake up, couldn’t not wake.  chemicals drip into a man’s veins, one each for heart, lungs, brain. strapped to a table, he stares impassive, eyes flickering shut, body a meat wall, iv tubes almost empty...  —i was asleep and not asleep, i couldn’t move to wake.  i hear shrill wings—that fly inspecting bread crumbs under dining hall tables while the warden blares descartes over the intercom: “if a man’s head were lopped off his mouth would keep on moving, faultlessly justifying his crimes.”  but that fly, that speck against steel, its wings steered in ways that seem crazy to eyes awake, not awake, not seeing, all-seeing, the head unmoving moving to turn away...oh seely fly i can’t not see, can’t move to brush away from my unsleeping eyes, you veer in spirals unflattened into pathos of careening chaos, your eccentric flight path darts through bars, oh alas, hairy vibrant fly!

 1.  after the sweet promise, the summer’s mild retreat from mother’s cancer, the winter months of her death, i come to this white office, its sterile sheet, its hard tablet, its stirrups, to hold my breath while i, who must, allow the glove its oily rape, to hear the almost mighty doctor over me equate my ills with hers and decide to operate.  it grew in her as simply as a child would grow, as simply as she housed me once, fat and female. always my most gentle house before that embryo of evil spread in her shelter and she grew frail. frail, we say, remembering fear, that face we wear in the room of the special smells of dying, fear where the snoring mouth gapes and is not dear.  there was snow everywhere. each day i grueled through its sloppy peak, its blue-struck days, my boots slapping into the hospital halls, past the retinue of nurses at the desk, to murmur in cahoots with hers outside her door, to enter with the outside air stuck on my skin, to enter smelling her pride, her upkeep, and to lie as all who love have lied.  no reason to be afraid, my almost mighty doctor reasons. i nod, thinking that woman’s dying must come in seasons, thinking that living is worth buying. i walk out, scuffing a raw leaf, kicking the clumps of dead straw that were this summer’s lawn. automatically i get in my car, knowing the historic thief is loose in my house and must be set upon.   2.  clean of the body’s hair, i lie smooth from breast to leg. all that was special, all that was rare is common here. fact: death too is in the egg. fact: the body is dumb, the body is meat. and tomorrow the o.r. only the summer was sweet.  the rooms down the hall are calling all night long, while the night outside sucks at the trees. i hear limbs falling and see yellow eyes flick in the rain. wide eyed and still whole i turn in my bin like a shorn lamb. a nurse’s flashlight blinds me to see who i am.  the walls color in a wash of daylight until the room takes its objects into itself again. i smoke furtively and squash the butt and hide it with my watch and other effects. the halls bustle with legs. i smile at the nurse who smiles for the morning shift. day is worse.  scheduled late, i cannot drink or eat, except for yellow pills and a jigger of water. i wait and think until she brings two mysterious needles: the skills she knows she knows, promising, soon you’ll be out. but nothing is sure. no one. i wait in doubt.  i wait like a kennel of dogs jumping against their fence. at ten she returns, laughs and catalogues my resistance to drugs. on the stretcher, citizen and boss of my own body still, i glide down the halls and rise in the iron cage toward science and pitfalls.  the great green people stand over me; i roll on the table under a terrible sun, following their command to curl, head touching knee if i am able. next, i am hung up like a saddle and they begin. pale as an angel i float out over my own skin.  i soar in hostile air over the pure women in labor, over the crowning heads of babies being born. i plunge down the backstair calling mother at the dying door, to rush back to my own skin, tied where it was torn. its nerves pull like wires snapping from the leg to the rib. strangers, their faces rolling lilke hoops, require my arm. i am lifted into my aluminum crib.   3.  skull flat, here in my harness, thick with shock, i call mother to help myself, call toe to frog, that woolly bat, that tongue of dog; call god help and all the rest. the soul that swam the furious water sinks now in flies and the brain flops like a docked fish and the eyes are flat boat decks riding out the pain.  my nurses, those starchy ghosts, hover over me for my lame hours and my lame days. the mechanics of the body pump for their tricks. i rest on their needles, am dosed and snoring amid the orange flowers and the eyes of visitors. i wear, like some senile woman, a scarlet candy package ribbon in my hair.  four days from home i lurk on my mechanical parapet with two pillows at my elbows, as soft as praying cushions. my knees work with the bed that runs on power. i grumble to forget the lie i ought to hear, but don't. god knows i thought i’d die—but here i am, recalling mother, the sound of her good morning, the odor of orange and jam.  all’s well, they say. they say i’m better. i lounge in frills or, picturesque, i wear bunny pink slippers in the hall. i read a new book and shuffle past the desk to mail the author my first fan letter. time now to pack this humpty-dumpty back the frightened way she came and run along, anne, and run along now, my stomach laced like a football for the game.

 i wept in a stable. i found money in the dirt. i reenacted a car accident in the tack room. i asked a horse van driver to let me off where the bridle path stopped. i looked at the jockey for what he was dreaming. i told him he was wrong about making things happen. he couldn’t make things happen. i couldn’t make things happen anymore. there is exactly not enough money in the world. magical thinking got me where i am today. animals are warriors of time. i stopped keeping things hidden. that wasn’t a horse we saw in the winner’s circle. i can’t stop horses as much as you can’t stop horses.

 the bergman image of a game of chess with death, though not in a dreamscape black-and-white as melancholy films clanking with symbols, but in a garden in provence with goldfish in the fountain and enormous palms whose topmost fronds cut into the eternal blue of sky above the roman ruins and the dusty streets where any door may lead to life’s most perfect meal: that is what i think of when i remember i have aids. but when i think of how aids kills my friends, especially the ones whose paths through life have least prepared them to resist the monster, i think of an insatiable and prowling beast with razor teeth and a persistent stink that sticks to every living branch of flower its rank fur brushes as it stalks its prey. i think of that disgusting animal eating my beautiful friends, innocent as baby deer. dwight: so delicate and vain, his spindly arms and legs pinned down with needles, pain of tubes and needles, his narrow chest inflated by machine, his mind lost in the seven-minute gap between the respirator’s failure and the time the nurses noticed something wrong. i wrapped my limbs around that fragile body for the first time seven years ago, in a cheap hotel by the piers, where every bit of his extravagant wardrobe—snakeskin boots, skin-tight pedal pushers in a leopard print, aviator’s scarves, and an electric- green capacious leather jacket— lay wrapped in a corner of his room in a yellow parachute. it's hard enough to find a parachute in new york city, i remember thinking, but finding one the right shade of canary is the accomplishment of the sort of citizen with whom i wish to populate my life. dwight the dancer, dwight the fashion illustrator and the fashion plate, dwight the child, the borderline transvestite, dwight the frightened, infuriating me because an anti-azt diatribe by some eccentric in a rag convinced him not to take the pills with which he might still be alive, dwight on the runway, dwight on the phone suggesting we could still have sex if we wore “raincoats,” dwight screwing a girl from massapequa in the ladies’ room at danceteria (he wore more makeup and had better jewelry than she did), dwight planning the trip to london or berlin where he would be discovered and his life transformed. dwight erased, evicted from his own young body. dwight dead. at bellevue, i wrapped my arms around his second skin of gauze and scars and tubing, brushed my hand against his plats, and said goodbye. i hope i’m not the one who loosed the devouring animal that massacred you, gentle boy. you didn’t have a clue to how you might stave off the beast. i feel so confident most days that i can stay alive, survive and thrive with aids. but when i see dwight smile and hear his fey delighted voice inside my head, i know aids is no chess game but a hunt, and there is no way of escaping the bloody horror of the kill, no way to bail out, no bright parachute beside my bed.

 sweet marie-anne, she thought being french, intellectual and brunette  entitled her, in any parisian cafe to prompt service—and she was  probably right, (as the policeman later confirmed)—always provided  the situation was normal, and she herself did not let the race down.  so that afternoon, she said to me: “sit by me,mon cheri, and order  a drink!”—well! the waiter came as was his duty, only to stand aghast  at the unspeakable scandal of a full-blooded french woman kissing  this merde of a black man openly and full on the lips!—purebred son of  the galls, his first impulse was to smash his tray at the black head  and shriek out for help to the army of riot police permanently stationed on the streets  of the latin quarter . . . —but he was a non-violent man, and besides,  he had the customer’s tip to think of. so he turned to me, swallowing hard, and  with controlled french politeness, he said: “m’sieur, please sit opposite the lady—  “yes, with the sacre table between you, face to face—or mon cul, dammit, i shall not serve you!”—and i was still wiping off her lipstick, wondering what to do, when my lady  spoke, her face red with indignation: “but you’re mistaken! this one’s not like the rest,  “can’t you see! he’s a bon sauvage, and has written such brilliant essays in impreccable french  “on the phallus of—pardon, the merits of negritude! show him my dear!” she turned to me, “show how well  “you quote molière, corneille, and—” but the waiter was already smiling and bowing: i had passed my test.

 angels are unthinkable in hot weather  except in some tropical locales, where from time to time, the women catch one in their nets,  hang it dry, and fashion it into a lantern that will burn forever on its own inexhaustible oils.  but here—shins smocked with heat rash, the supersaturated air. we no longer believe  in energies pure enough not to carry heat, nor in connections—the thought of someone  somewhere warming the air we breathe that one degree more . . . .  in a packed pub during the world cup final, a bony redhead woman gripped my arm  too hard.i could see how a bloke might fancy you. like a child’s perfect outline in fast-melting snow,  her wet handprint on my skin, disappearing. the crowd boiling over, a steam jet:brrra-zil!  and paris—a heroin addict who put her hypodermic  to my throat:je suis malade. j’ai besoin de medicaments.  grabbing her wrist, i saw her forearm’s tight net sleeve of drying blood.  i don’t like to be touched. i stand in this mammoth parking lot,  car doors open, letting the air conditioner run for a while before getting in.  the heat presses down equally everywhere. it wants to focus itself,  to vaporize something instantaneously, efficiently—that shopping cart, maybe,  or that half-crushed brown-glass bottle— but can’t quite. asphalt softens in the sun.  nothing’s detachable. the silvery zigzag line  stitching the tarmac to the sky around the edges is no breeze, just a trick of heat.  my splayed-out compact car half-sunk in the tar pit of its own shadow—  strong-shouldered, straining to lift its vestigial wings.

 we wondered what our walk should mean, taking that un-march quietly; the sun stared at our signs— “thou shalt not kill.”  men by a tavern said, “those foreigners . . .” to a woman with a fur, who turned away— like an elevator going down, their look at us.  along a curb, their signs lined across, a picket line stopped and stared the whole width of the street, at ours: “unfair.”  above our heads the sound truck blared— by the park, under the autumn trees— it said that love could fill the atmosphere:  occur, slow the other fallout, unseen, on islands everywhere—fallout, falling unheard. we held our poster up to shade our eyes.  at the end we just walked away; no one was there to tell us where to leave the signs.

 "in spite of everything i shall rise again: i will take up my pencil, which i have forsaken in my great discouragement, and i will go on with my drawing."— vincent van gogh a missile is shaped like a pencil— its long, slender body and pointed end creates history.  a girl walking down the street a few steps ahead of her sister and friend, two medics who were trying to help injured people, the parked ambulance— all were annihilated by the same weapon.  above, drones—silent, unmanned planes. a metal, predatory bird that shoots a missile with precision, identifying the colors of a shirt, the features on a face—the shape of a nose, the color and length of a mustache.  in a room far away, in another country, a man sits at a desk and looks at a screen; he strokes his thick, dark mustache as he carefully contemplates, then pushes a button.  there is a charred hole in the ground where the girl once stood.  there are pencils that write and erase, write and erase, so that there is nothing to be read on the page. the page blank as the desert sky, blank as the smooth shell of a drone.  there is a family drinking mint tea in a living room. the man holds a cup to his lips, the glass touches his mustache. a silent bird hovers above. in a split second, everyone is dead, the house is in rubbles—arms, legs, splattered organs among broken concrete.  soon, there will be no trace.

 hate the people of this village and would nail our hats to our heads for refusing in their presence to remove them or staple our hands to our foreheads for refusing to salute them if we did not hurt them first: mail them packages of rats, mix their flour at night with broken glass. we do this, they do that. they peel the larynx from one of our brothers’ throats. we devein one of their sisters. the quicksand pits they built were good. our amputation teams were better. we trained some birds to steal their wheat. they sent to us exploding ambassadors of peace. they do this, we do that. we canceled our sheep imports. they no longer bought our blankets. we mocked their greatest poet and when that had no effect we parodied the way they dance which did cause pain, so they, in turn, said our god was leprous, hairless. we do this, they do that. ten thousand (10,000) years, ten thousand (10,000) brutal, beautiful years.

 wolf moon  no moon in sight, so i howled at the exit sign instead. red runes, electric. telling an old story of escape, of wind, a wide cold. a distant car alarm. otherwise: the dark, and our bodies, two strange women trying to touch each other. breathing strange. moving toward or away from each other as the red ghost in the sky opened, called us gone, showed us the door to another world. otherwise, the dark, and our mouths, tearing at what bones we could find. grinning and hungry for something — something we couldn’t, with all our words, name.  snow moon  the magic where the streetlights turn the snow pink lasts only for the first night, the same way, maybe, a blanket loses track of its scent when it’s been touched by too many hands, or the way a body grays when too many feet have dragged their cigarettes and complaints through it. but for that one first night, everything cold- flecked and whispering was ours, the pink light ours, sent from some other world so we could, for a night, feel untouched. so we could feel like sugar—crumbling, and perfect for it.  worm moon  like any girl, i pulled myself into shreds to test the rumor that something with blood like mine could be halved and still whole. and what did i learn? i buried myself all over the garden, but the pieces only sprouted into new riddles: squid leg, spaghetti squash, a jerking thumb. their names still sounded like mine; everyone in the same dress, chewing dirt to avoid each others’ eyes. i lay down next to the one beneath the porch, hiding among the oyster shells.don’t cry, i said, but she cried anyway. her tears fell straight into my eyes. what a lesson—to watch them float back and forth between us until we knew each one’s shape. until we knew, finally, what to do with them.  pink moon  outside, the colors leapt from the trees. here, inside, some new word was blooming in my underwear—darker than i’d expected. i’d expected something pink; a slow, sweet trickle. not this wet tar, treacle, dark, like the blood had been stretching inside me for years, slow-building into a sticky chord, the first falling away. soil’s been watered; come play. first stuck, first gum, first hum of pollen, calling in the bees and readying to wilt.  flower moon  spring is the season of crying and seeing nothing. of choking up on someone else’s trash. barbed tennis balls that lodge wherever air’s supposed to go, nasal cavity homewreckers. all spring my lenses wrenched themselves from my eyes, jumped ship, spore-lined and furious. everything melted and ran down my face. all the trees wanted my number. sent fuzzy messengers to murmur in my ears:i get so afraid sometimes all i want all i want is. all spring i brushed confessions out of my hair. tore the little letters apart and locked myself in the refrigerator, until the world promised to stop birthing such soft things.  strawberry moon  the house was filled with the smell of it, the last misshapen, sweet-heavy berries of the season losing their shapes on the stove. the house was filled with the smell of fruit unbecoming, fruit pulled to its knees at fire’s feet. all summer long, the bushes had whispered take me, shown us all the places we could kiss if we wanted. and so, as the light died, we put our mouths on the least lovable, the too-full, the easy-bruised, we shouted,i choose you, and you, and you, and you, and canned that hunger, and spooned it into our mouths on the coldest days.  buck moon  some of the cloven-hoofed things are good at leaping from one rock shelf to another without shattering. good, in other words, at falling. i never trusted that ankles were any match for my body’s insistence on becoming earth again. so when i found myself on the cliff face, i knew it was dive or dust. a boy called to me from the bottom of the gorge, called me all the names he knew, and i stood frozen, wearing a crown of bones. the gravel laughed as it fled from my feet. i shouted down to the boy,don’t try to milk me unless you’re fond of being kicked — buck and bray and jawbone. he responded,no, totally, sounds tough, how are you feeling?  sturgeon moon  i hid in his rivers and estuaries. i ate his wet earth’s crops. i grew plump for him. grew egg-lined, thirty tiny hearts in my belly, fruit thumping with seeds. he pulled me from the mud. laid me out in the sun. opened me down the center. scraped every dead daughter from my silly maw. i learned better next time. next time, i grew three extra rows of seeds. hid them in my mouth. sharpened them to teeth.  harvest moon  last winter, when we finally kissed under fluorescent lights, that was the seed we pressed between the ground’s lips. then i laughed when the sky collapsed into pathetic rivers. then i drank the dirt through my hooves, and liked it. then i ate all the sun i could find. though the weeds claw, sugar-starved, at my thighs. though the sky casts over, cataract, callous, and the earth fumes as iron claws uproot the children’s children we keep warm in our bellies. still, when the moon and the horses are fat on the horizon, still you’ll find me, arms heavy with eggplant, chard, tomatoes bruised blue, blushing kohlrabi till the kohlrabi’s gone. will you pluck me before the dust does, root and all, radicchio tendon? i promise, i’ll feed no upright animal. only the bees and the bees, beans sitting on the squash’s face. will you turn your palms to the sky? will you turn your palms to the prayer hunger makes? will you feed and feed, and lick the bowl clean when we’re both full?  hunter’s moon  i picked up my own scent somewhere on the forest’s edge. spoiling flour, holy basil, sweat. my oldest smell is the smell that still clings to pajama sleeves late into saturday afternoon. toothpaste, mixed with the musk of rest. i pressed my snout to the ground and breathed deep, watched the tendrils of my slug trail bloom blue, bioluminescent. i followed the maze, pushbrooming forest floor with face, followed the promise of a rapid heart. don’t ask who’s the bloodhound, who’s the hare, when there’s a chase to be made: the clarity of a cardinal direction clicking into place. and: the quickening—the tendons that appear, sudden, when the distant, rabid howl of hunters rolls across the tree line, and you lift your head in greeting.  beaver moon  we made our home in the place where the water slowed. yes. we flooded the plains until the landscape bloomed with wet. we stopped the tub. we drew a bath and called the river to its new, quieter life. ring-builders. kingdom carved. at the end of the line, we made our own place. sure, from above, it looks like a snaking tail, headed by a circle. from here, in the mud, it doesn’t look like that at all. it looks like a world. like a cleared space. like everything that’s left when the trees soften and come, at last, crashing.  cold moon  back below the ice. back to swim. seastar. creeping brine. we salt, sink. we pull down the cold. we pull the moon to our floor.      hello.      waterstone. brinicle. cold-blooded and still flesh.    still    horned    fingers groping the kelp bed. still salt. pull. everything the ice touches. is ours. is quiet now. we sink slow. we pray still. for moon. we answer it now. ourselves.

 groundbreaking ceremony, city of south miami, sunset drive improvements and so it began: the earth torn, split open by a dirt road cutting through palmettos and wild tamarind trees defending the land against the sun. beside the road, a shack leaning into the wind, on the wooden porch, crates of avocados and limes, white chickens pecking at the floor boards, and a man under the shadow of his straw hat, staring into the camera in 1914. he doesn't know within a lifetime the unclaimed land behind him will be cleared of scrub and sawgrass, the soil will be turned, made to give back what the farmers wish, their lonely houses will stand acres apart from one another, jailed behind the boughs of their orchards. he'll never buy sugar at the general store, mail love letters at the post office, or take a train at the depot of the town that will rise out of hundred-million years of coral rock on promises of paradise. he'll never ride a model-t puttering down the dirt road that will be paved over, stretch farther and farther west into the horizon, reaching for the setting sun after which it will be named. he can't even begin to imagine the shadows of buildings rising taller than the palm trees, the street lights glowing like counterfeit stars dotting the sky above the road, the thousands who will take the road everyday, who'll also call this place home less than a hundred years after the photograph of him hanging today in city hall as testament. he'll never meet me, the engineer hired to transform the road again, bring back tree shadows and birdsongs, build another promise of another paradise meant to last another forever. he'll never see me, the poet standing before him, trying to read his mind across time, wondering if he was thinking what i'm today, both of us looking down the road that will stretch on for years after i too disappear into a photo.

 hamelin town's in brunswick, by famous hanover city; the river weser, deep and wide, washes its wall on the southern side; a pleasanter spot you never spied; but, when begins my ditty, almost five hundred years ago, to see the townsfolk suffer so from vermin, was a pity.  rats! they fought the dogs, and killed the cats, and bit the babies in the cradles, and eat the cheeses out of the vats, and licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles, split open the kegs of salted sprats, made nests inside men's sunday hats, and even spoiled the women's chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats.  at last the people in a body to the town hall came flocking: 'tis clear, cried they, our mayor's a noddy; and as for our corporation — shocking to think we buy gowns lined with ermine for dolts that can't or won't determine what's like to rid us of our vermin! rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking to find the remedy we're lacking, or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing! at this the mayor and corporation quaked with a mighty consternation.  an hour they sate in council, at length the mayor broke silence: for a guilder i'd my ermine gown sell; i wish i were a mile hence! it's easy to bid one rack one's brain — i'm sure my poor head aches again i've scratched it so, and all in vain. oh for a trap, a trap, a trap! just as he said this, what should hap at the chamber door but a gentle tap? bless us, cried the mayor, what's that? (with the corporation as he sate, looking little though wondrous fat); only a scraping of shoes on the mat? anything like the sound of a rat makes my heart go pit-a-pat!  come in! — the mayor cried, looking bigger: and in did come the strangest figure! his queer long coat from heel to head was half of yellow and half of red; and he himself was tall and thin, with sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, and light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, no tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, but lips where smiles went out and in — there was no guessing his kith and kin! and nobody could enough admire the tall man and his quaint attire: quoth one: it's as my great-grandsire, starting up at the trump of doom's tone, had walked this way from his painted tombstone!  he advanced to the council-table: and, please your honours, said he, i'm able, by means of a secret charm, to draw all creatures living beneath the sun, that creep, or swim, or fly, or run, after me so as you never saw! and i chiefly use my charm on creatures that do people harm, the mole, and toad, and newt, and viper; and people call me the pied piper. (and here they noticed round his neck a scarf of red and yellow stripe, to match with his coat of the self-same cheque; and at the scarf's end hung a pipe; and his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying as if impatient to be playing upon this pipe, as low it dangled over his vesture so old-fangled.) yet, said he, poor piper as i am, in tartary i freed the cham, last june, from his huge swarms of gnats; i eased in asia the nizam of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats: and, as for what your brain bewilders, if i can rid your town of rats will you give me a thousand guilders? one? fifty thousand! — was the exclamation of the astonished mayor and corporation.  into the street the piper stept, smiling first a little smile, as if he knew what magic slept in his quiet pipe the while; then, like a musical adept, to blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, and green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled, like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled; and ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, you heard as if an army muttered; and the muttering grew to a grumbling; and the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; and out of the houses the rats came tumbling. great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats, grave old plodders, gay young friskers, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, cocking tails and pricking whiskers, families by tens and dozens, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives — followed the piper for their lives. from street to street he piped advancing, and step for step they followed dancing, until they came to the river weser wherein all plunged and perished — save one who, stout as julius caesar, swam across and lived to carry (as he the manuscript he cherished) to rat-land home his commentary, which was, at the first shrill notes of the pipe, i heard a sound as of scraping tripe, and putting apples, wondrous ripe, into a cider-press's gripe: and a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, and a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, and a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, and a breaking the hoops of butter-casks; and it seemed as if a voice (sweeter than by harp or by psaltery is breathed) called out, oh rats, rejoice! the world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 'so munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon, 'breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon! and just as one bulky sugar-puncheon, ready staved, like a great sun shone glorious scarce an inch before me, just as methought it said, come, bore me! — i found the weser rolling o'er me.  you should have heard the hamelin people ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple; go, cried the mayor, and get long poles! poke out the nests and block up the holes! consult with carpenters and builders, and leave in our town not even a trace of the rats! — when suddenly up the face of the piper perked in the market-place, with a, first, if you please, my thousand guilders!  a thousand guilders! the mayor looked blue; so did the corporation too. for council dinners made rare havock with claret, moselle, vin-de-grave, hock; and half the money would replenish their cellar's biggest butt with rhenish. to pay this sum to a wandering fellow with a gipsy coat of red and yellow! beside, quoth the mayor with a knowing wink, our business was done at the river's brink; we saw with our eyes the vermin sink, and what's dead can't come to life, i think. so, friend, we're not the folks to shrink from the duty of giving you something for drink, and a matter of money to put in your poke; but, as for the guilders, what we spoke of them, as you very well know, was in joke. beside, our losses have made us thrifty; a thousand guilders! come, take fifty!  the piper's face fell, and he cried, no trifling! i can't wait, beside! i've promised to visit by dinner time bagdat, and accept the prime of the head cook's pottage, all he's rich in, for having left, in the caliph's kitchen, of a nest of scorpions no survivor — with him i proved no bargain-driver, with you, don't think i'll bate a stiver! and folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion.  how? cried the mayor, d'ye think i'll brook being worse treated than a cook? insulted by a lazy ribald with idle pipe and vesture piebald? you threaten us, fellow? do your worst, blow your pipe there till you burst!  once more he stept into the street; and to his lips again laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; and ere he blew three notes (such sweet soft notes as yet musician's cunning never gave th'enraptured air) there was a rustling, that seem'd like a bustling of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, and, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering, out came the children running. all the little boys and girls, with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, tripping and skipping, ran merrily after the wonderful music with shouting and laughter.  the mayor was dumb, and the council stood as if they were changed into blocks of wood, unable to move a step, or cry to the children merrily skipping by — could only follow with the eye that joyous crowd at the piper's back. but how the mayor was on the rack, and the wretched council's bosoms beat, as the piper turned from the high street to where the weser rolled its waters right in the way of their sons and daughters! however he turned from south to west, and to coppelburg hill his steps addressed, and after him the children pressed; great was the joy in every breast. he never can cross that mighty top! he's forced to let the piping drop, and we shall see our children stop! when, lo, as they reached the mountain's side, a wondrous portal opened wide, as if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; and the piper advanced and the children follow'd, and when all were in to the very last, the door in the mountain side shut fast. did i say, all? no! one was lame, and could not dance the whole of the way; and in after years, if you would blame his sadness, he was used to say, — it's dull in our town since my playmates left! i can't forget that i'm bereft of all the pleasant sights they see, which the piper also promised me; for he led us, he said, to a joyous land, joining the town and just at hand, where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, and flowers put forth a fairer hue, and every thing was strange and new; the sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, and their dogs outran our fallow deer, and honey-bees had lost their stings, and horses were born with eagles' wings: and just as i felt assured my lame foot would be speedily cured, the music stopped and i stood still, and found myself outside the hill, left alone against my will, to go now limping as before, and never hear of that country more!  alas, alas for hamelin! there came into many a burgher's pate a text which says, that heaven's gate opes to the rich at as easy a rate as the needle's eye takes a camel in! the mayor sent east, west, north, and south, to offer the piper, by word of mouth, wherever it was men's lot to find him, silver and gold to his heart's content, if he'd only return the way he went, and bring the children behind him. but when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour, and piper and dancers were gone for ever, they made a decree that lawyers never should think their records dated duly if, after the day of the month and year, these words did not as well appear, "and so long after what happened here "on the twenty-second of july, "thirteen hundred and seventy-six:" and the better in memory to fix the place of the children's last retreat, they called it, the pied piper's street — where any one playing on pipe or tabor was sure for the future to lose his labour. nor suffered they hostelry or tavern to shock with mirth a street so solemn; but opposite the place of the cavern they wrote the story on a column, and on the great church window painted the same, to make the world acquainted how their children were stolen away; and there it stands to this very day. and i must not omit to say that in transylvania there's a tribe of alien people who ascribe the outlandish ways and dress on which their neighbours lay such stress to their fathers and mothers having risen out of some subterraneous prison into which they were trepanned long time ago in a mighty band out of hamelin town in brunswick land, but how or why, they don't understand.  so, willy, let you and me be wipers of scores out with all men — especially pipers: and, whether they pipe us from rats or from mice, if we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise.  
NEW POEM
 when i sleep i see a child  hidden between the legs of a scarred man,   their sunburnt backs breathe cold air, the child faces me   and the pier’s roof swallows the moon cut by the clouds behind them.   sometimes, they’re on the same roof wearing handkerchiefs   and uniformed men surround them. i mistake bullet casings   for cormorant beaks diving till water churns the color of sunsets,   stained barnacles line the pier and i can’t see who’s facedown   on boats lulled by crimson ripples. once, i heard the man —   alive and still on the roof — say today for you, tomorrow for me.   there’s a village where men train cormorants to fish: rope-end tied to sterns,   another to necks, so their beaks won’t swallow the fish they catch.   my father is one of those birds. he’s the scarred man.

 so he said: you ain’t got no talent if you didn’t have a face you wouldn’t be nobody  and she said: god created heaven and earth and all that’s black within them  so he said: you ain’t really no hot shit they tell me plenty sisters take care better business than you  and she said: on the third day he made chitterlings and all good things to eat and said: “that’s good”  so he said: if the white folks hadn’t been under yo skirt and been giving you the big play you’d a had to come on uptown like everybody else  and she replied: then he took a big black greasy rib from adam and said we will call this woeman and her name will be sapphire and she will divide into four parts that simone may sing a song  and he said: you pretty full of yourself ain’t chu  so she replied: show me someone not full of herself and i’ll show you a hungry person

 the cruel majority emerges!  hail to the cruel majority!  they will punish the poor for being poor. they will punish the dead for having died.  nothing can make the dark turn into light for the cruel majority. nothing can make them feel hunger or terror.  if the cruel majority would only cup their ears the sea would wash over them. the sea would help them forget their wayward children. it would weave a lullaby for young &amp; old.  (see the cruel majority with hands cupped to their ears, one foot is in the water, one foot is on the clouds.)  one man of them is large enough to hold a cloud between his thumb &amp; middle finger, to squeeze a drop of sweat from it before he sleeps.  he is a little god but not a poet. (see how his body heaves.)  the cruel majority love crowds &amp; picnics. the cruel majority fill up their parks with little flags. the cruel majority celebrate their birthday.  hail to the cruel majority again!  the cruel majority weep for their unborn children, they weep for the children that they will never bear. the cruel majority are overwhelmed by sorrow.  (then why are the cruel majority always laughing? is it because night has covered up the city's walls? because the poor lie hidden in the darkness? the maimed no longer come to show their wounds?)  today the cruel majority vote to enlarge the darkness.  they vote for shadows to take the place of ponds whatever they vote for they can bring to pass. the mountains skip like lambs for the cruel majority.  hail to the cruel majority! hail! hail! to the cruel majority!  the mountains skip like lambs, the hills like rams. the cruel majority tear up the earth for the cruel majority. then the cruel majority line up to be buried.  those who love death will love the cruel majority.  those who know themselves will know the fear the cruel majority feel when they look in the mirror.  the cruel majority order the poor to stay poor. they order the sun to shine only on weekdays.  the god of the cruel majority is hanging from a tree. their god's voice is the tree screaming as it bends. the tree's voice is as quick as lightning as it streaks across the sky.  (if the cruel majority go to sleep inside their shadows, they will wake to find their beds filled up with glass.)  hail to the god of the cruel majority! hail to the eyes in the head of their screaming god!  hail to his face in the mirror!  hail to their faces as they float around him!  hail to their blood &amp; to his!  hail to the blood of the poor they need to feed them! hail to their world &amp; their god!  hail &amp; farewell! hail &amp; farewell! hail &amp; farewell!

 the tea-kettle bubbled, the tea things were set, the candles were lighted, the ladies were met; the how d’ye’s were over, and entering bustle, the company seated, and silks ceased to rustle: the great mrs. consequence opened her fan, and thus the discourse in an instant began (all affected reserve and formality scorning): “i suppose you all saw in the paper this morning a volume of poems advertised—’tis said they’re produced by the pen of a poor servant-maid.” “a servant write verses!” says madam du bloom: “pray what is the subject—a mop, or a broom?” “he, he, he,” says miss flounce: “i suppose we shall see an ode on a dishclout—what else can it be?” says miss coquettilla, “why, ladies, so tart? perhaps tom the footman has fired her heart; and she’ll tell us how charming he looks in new clothes, and how nimble his hand moves in brushing the shoes; or how, the last time that he went to may fair, he bought her some sweethearts of gingerbread ware.” “for my part i think,” says old lady marr-joy, “a servant might find herself other employ: was she mine i’d employ her as long as ’twas light, and send her to bed without candle at night.” “why so?” says miss rhymer, displeased: “i protest ’tis pity a genius should be so depressed!” “what ideas can such low-bred creatures conceive?” says mrs. noworthy, and laughed in her sleeve. says old miss prudella, “if servants can tell how to write to their mothers, to say they are well, and read of a sunday the duty of man, which is more i believe than one half of them can; i think ’tis much properer they should rest there, than be reaching at things so much out of their sphere.” says old mrs. candour, “i’ve now got a maid that’s the plague of my life—a young gossiping jade; there’s no end of the people that after her come, and whenever i’m out, she is never at home; i’d rather ten times she would sit down and write, than gossip all over the town every night.” “some whimsical trollop most like,” says miss prim, “has been scribbling of nonsense, just out of a whim, and, conscious it neither is witty nor pretty, conceals her true name, and ascribes it to betty.” “i once had a servant myself,” says miss pines, “that wrote on a wedding some very good lines.” says mrs. domestic, “and when they were done, i can’t see for my part what use they were on; had she wrote a receipt, to’ve instructed you how to warm a cold breast of veal, like a ragout, or to make cowslip wine, that would pass for champagne, it might have been useful, again and again.” on the sofa was old lady pedigree placed; she owned that for poetry she had no taste, that the study of heraldry was more in fashion, and boasted she knew all the crests in the nation. says mrs. routella, “tom, take out the urn, and stir up the fire, you see it don’t burn.” the tea-things removed, and the tea-table gone, the card-tables brought, and the cards laid thereon, the ladies, ambitious for each other’s crown, like courtiers contending for honours, sat down.  
NEW POEM
 you've heard me, scornful, harsh, and discontented,  mocking and loathing war: you've asked me why  of my old, silly sweetness i've repented—  my ecstasies changed to an ugly cry.   you are aware that once i sought the grail,  riding in armour bright, serene and strong;  and it was told that through my infant wail  there rose immortal semblances of song.   but now i've said good-bye to galahad,  and am no more the knight of dreams and show:  for lust and senseless hatred make me glad,  and my killed friends are with me where i go.  wound for red wound i burn to smite their wrongs;  and there is absolution in my songs.  
NEW POEM
 the jolt that comes to bones inside a tumbled streetcar  is what the painter considers as she strokes her- self into story. there is less to the jolt that  comes as he shuts his eyes before the monitor, save  what he imagines—a lightning bolt, a god tapping the shoulder. he imagines the sky swelling  with ceiling fans or the guano of extinct birds,  a jolt riding from his shoulder blades to his eyelids, dropping with roller  coaster clacks to his fingers. here, he dreams of frida  kahlo. here, he says,let me spread my flesh out like a table linen, let my bones be silver that touches,  making, again, that clack. my skull will be a glass,  set properly, i have class enough.  
NEW POEM
 name one revolution whose inception was unlike a fist. factions disparate, then tucked together—coiled like a fist.  foreign policies are symbol languages—idiomatic, cryptic. in america, nothing says "we desire peace" like a fist.  the heart is a one-man rave in the body's industrial district. blooddrunk and insomniac, it pumps toward sleep like a fist.  mammogram magic revealed my lover's dense breasts. behind each nipple i kissed, a soft knot threatened her like a fist.  our universe's yet shattered mysteries fear the astrophysicist. "damn his galaxies-thick glasses, his mind, relentless, like a fist."  "like a glove"—the young groom exalts his wife's love, its fit. sounds romantic. (he means sex—her love's grip like a fist.)  "an unfocused punch, kyle, risks a broken hand or wrist." so laden the psyches of men. father, must i also think like a fist?

 the  pioneers and the indians disagree about a lot of things for example, the pioneer says that when you meet a bear in the woods you should yell at him and if that doesn't work, you should fell him the indians say that you should whisper to him softly and call him by loving nicknames no one's bothered to ask the bear what he thinks  
NEW POEM
 in phnom penh’s museum, the skulls are stacked in aquarium tanks: grim toys for hooks to ply free from the rubble. here, each one gets a tag, a mount, a photograph to suggest a life, perhaps a name, might be envisioned. yet i’m more moved by what’s anonymous, past; imagine fields of faces sunken with decay, eyes jellied in their sockets, heel meats bruised, bloated in the rain— perhaps the skulls prefer a lack of names as, scrubbed of self and skin, they’re trauma’s best witnesses: fused by time and pain to one crisis, never to be separated. lost as men, they become event. in this, they achieve a terrible transcendence.  
NEW POEM
 the pleasure of contrast: not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater, holding his breath, but composing himself  for the camera, in his only suit. you have to understand photography— unforgiving mirror, unlike oils that soften  the hard edges of a man’s face if you want them to, or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape.  the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter. that’s not at all how it’s done— the camera’s lens blanketed by cloth  to keep it in the dark; any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow. his eyes already turn inward to that place we’re going.  she thinks about escape too: at the horse butcher, in line like the others, or arguing over the price of bread  at the market of innocents. adam’s rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer’s fist,  but she, at least, is smiling when he says, we have such a small family, meaning your body  won’t open to me—it’s shackled inside its cage: love and rage, whose bars are meant to be broken.

 there are two kinds of people, soldiers and women, as virginia woolf said. both for decoration only.  now that is too kind. it’s technical: virgins and wolves. we have choices now. two little girls walk into a bar,  one orders a shirley temple. shirley temple’s pimp comes over and says you won’t be sorry. she’s a fine  piece of work but she don’t come cheap. myself, i’m in less fear of predators than of walking around  in my mother’s body. that’s sneaky, that’s more than naked. let’s even it up: you go on fuming in your  gray room. i am voracious alone. blank and loose, metallic lingerie. and rare black-tipped cigarettes  in a handmade basket case. which of us weaves the world together with a quicker blur of armed  seduction: your war-on-thugs, my body stockings. ascetic or carnivore. men will crack your glaze  even if you leave them before morning. pigs ride the sirens in packs. ah, flesh, technoflesh,  there are two kinds of people. hot with mixed light, drunk on insult. you and me.  
NEW POEM
 when the trees were guilty, hugged up to history &amp; locked in a cross-brace with whitman's louisiana live oak, you went into that mossy weather.  did you witness the shotguns at angola riding on horseback through the tall sway of sugarcane, the glint of blue steel in the bloodred strawberry fields?  silence was backed up in the cypress, but you could hear the birds of woe singing praise where the almost broken- through sorrow rose from the deep woods  &amp; walked out into moonshine as the brave ones. you went among those who had half a voice, whose ancestors mastered quicksand by disappearing. maybe our paths crossed  ghosts hogtied in the wounded night, but it is only now i say this: galway, thanks for going down into our fierce hush at the crossroads to look fear in the eye.  
NEW POEM
 it was a vertical time. it was the expression, a spirit giving way onto an electric barren. we circled and were encircled and had no cause. it was a time of the self come on in a field of apparatuses. it was vignetted by sleep, and the sleep was in its center breached. cold moving through the smell of gas. the big-leafed enclosure. it was a time that clattered at the horizons, whose recounting was already foreclosed, as in a numeral smudged in powder, as in a thin water making of the atmosphere a disc. it was a time of guzzling. a time amid what has been kept, a time of calendered trust, repeated appeal, erasures of flight. we begin with a weedy stem drawn against the winter sky. dear hierophant, our decision initialed. the muffled sound of the closet and the machine.  
NEW POEM
 aloft between heaven and them,  i babble the landscape—what staunch, vicious trees, what cluttered roads, slow cars. this is my  country as it was gifted me—victimless, vast. the soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears continually loops ditties of eagles and oil. i can’t choose. every moment i’m awake, aroused instrumentals channel theme songs, speaking what i cannot.  i don’t ever have to come down. i can stay hooked to heaven, dictating this blandness. my flyboys memorize flip and soar. they’ll never swoop real enough to resurrect that other country,  won’t ever get close enough to give name to tonight’s dreams darkening the water.  i understand that somewhere it has rained.  
NEW POEM
 blackness is a title, is a preoccupation, is a commitment blacks are to comprehend— and in which you are to perceive your glory.  the conscious shout of all that is white is “it’s great to be white.” the conscious shout of the slack in black is "it's great to be white." thus all that is white has white strength and yours.  the word black has geographic power, pulls everybody in: blacks here— blacks there— blacks wherever they may be. and remember, you blacks, what they told you— remember your education: “one drop—one drop maketh a brand new black.” oh mighty drop. ______and because they have given us kindly so many more of our people  blackness stretches over the land. blackness— the black of it, the rust-red of it, the milk and cream of it, the tan and yellow-tan of it, the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it, the “olive” and ochre of it— blackness marches on.  the huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride is to comprehend, to salute and to love the fact that we are black, which is our “ultimate reality,” which is the lone ground from which our meaningful metamorphosis, from which our prosperous staccato, group or individual, can rise.  self-shriveled blacks. begin with gaunt and marvelous concession: you are our costume and our fundamental bone.  all of you— you colored ones, you negro ones, those of you who proudly cry “i’m half indian”— those of you who proudly screech “i’ve got the blood of george washington in my veins” all of you— you proper blacks, you half-blacks, you wish-i-weren’t blacks, niggeroes and niggerenes.   you.

 cuk son is a story. tucson is a linguistic alternative. the story is in the many languages still heard in this place of black mountains. they are in the echo of lost, forgotten languages heard here even before the people arrived.  the true story of this place recalls people walking deserts all their lives and continuing today, if only in their dreams. the true story is ringing in their footsteps in a place so quiet, they can hear their blood moving through their veins. their stories give shape to the mountains encircling this place. wa:k is the story of water memories of this desert.  citizens gravitate to sabino canyon. the humming, buzzing, clicking of water life, the miracle of desert streams on smooth boulders. rocks, sediment older than life itself serve as reminders. it should be unnecessary for sticky notes to remind us what a desert place is. a place dependent on rains of summer, light dusting of snow, the rarity of dry beds as rebel rivers. it is real desert people who lift their faces upward with the first signs of moisture. they know how to inhale properly. recognizing the aroma of creosote in the distance. relieved the cycle is beginning again. these people are to be commended.  it is others who lament the heat of a june day, simultaneously finding pride on surviving the heat—a dry heat. these individuals should simply be tolerated.  opposed to those who move from one air-conditioned environment to another, never acknowledging the heat of summer. being grateful for november, when temperatures drop below eighty, complaining of the lack of seasons in the desert, heading for mountains to see colors— these people—well, what can we say. we must feel for the dogs of tucson. who bark as if they belong to somebody and who, before the rain, wish they were a color other than black.

 i get there early and i find a chair. i squeeze my plastic cup of wine. i nod. i maladroitly eat a pretzel rod and second an opinion i don’t share. i think: whatever else i am, i’m there. afterwards, i escape across the quad into fresh air, alone again, thank god. nobody cares. they’re quite right not to care.  i can’t go home. even my family is thoroughly contemptuous of me. i look bad. i’m exactly how i look. these days i never read, but no one does, and, anyhow, i proved how smart i was. everything i know is from a book.

 i strolled up old bonanza, where i staked in ninety-eight, a-purpose to revisit the old claim. i kept thinking mighty sadly of the funny ways of fate, and the lads who once were with me in the game. poor boys, they’re down-and-outers, and there’s scarcely one to-day can show a dozen colors in his poke; and me, i’m still prospecting, old and battered, gaunt and gray, and i’m looking for a grub-stake, and i’m broke.  i strolled up old bonanza. the same old moon looked down; the same old landmarks seemed to yearn to me; but the cabins all were silent, and the flat, once like a town, was mighty still and lonesome-like to see. there were piles and piles of tailings where we toiled with pick and pan, and turning round a bend i heard a roar, and there a giant gold-ship of the very newest plan was tearing chunks of pay-dirt from the shore.  it wallowed in its water-bed; it burrowed, heaved and swung; it gnawed its way ahead with grunts and sighs; its bill of fare was rock and sand; the tailings were its dung; it glared around with fierce electric eyes. full fifty buckets crammed its maw; it bellowed out for more; it looked like some great monster in the gloom. with two to feed its sateless greed, it worked for seven score, and i sighed: “ah, old-time miner, here’s your doom!”  the idle windlass turns to rust; the sagging sluice-box falls; the holes you digged are water to the brim; your little sod-roofed cabins with the snugly moss-chinked walls are deathly now and mouldering and dim. the battle-field is silent where of old you fought it out; the claims you fiercely won are lost and sold. but there’s a little army that they’ll never put to rout — the men who simply live to seek the gold.  the men who can’t remember when they learned to swing a pack, or in what lawless land the quest began; the solitary seeker with his grub-stake on his back, the restless buccaneer of pick and pan. on the mesas of the southland, on the tundras of the north, you will find us, changed in face but still the same; and it isn’t need, it isn’t greed that sends us faring forth — it’s the fever, it’s the glory of the game.  for once you’ve panned the speckled sand and seen the bonny dust, its peerless brightness blinds you like a spell; it’s little else you care about; you go because you must, and you feel that you could follow it to hell. you’d follow it in hunger, and you’d follow it in cold; you’d follow it in solitude and pain; and when you’re stiff and battened down let someone whisper “gold,” you’re lief to rise and follow it again.  yet look you, if i find the stuff it’s just like so much dirt; i fling it to the four winds like a child. it’s wine and painted women and the things that do me hurt, till i crawl back, beggared, broken, to the wild. till i crawl back, sapped and sodden, to my grub-stake and my tent — there’s a city, there’s an army (hear them shout). there’s the gold in millions, millions, but i haven’t got a cent; and oh, it’s me, it’s me that found it out.  it was my dream that made it good, my dream that made me go to lands of dread and death disprized of man; but oh, i’ve known a glory that their hearts will never know, when i picked the first big nugget from my pan. it’s still my dream, my dauntless dream, that drives me forth once more to seek and starve and suffer in the vast; that heaps my heart with eager hope, that glimmers on before — my dream that will uplift me to the last.  perhaps i am stark crazy, but there’s none of you too sane; it’s just a little matter of degree. my hobby is to hunt out gold; it’s fortressed in my brain; it’s life and love and wife and home to me. and i’ll strike it, yes, i’ll strike it; i’ve a hunch i cannot fail; i’ve a vision, i’ve a prompting, i’ve a call; i hear the hoarse stampeding of an army on my trail, to the last, the greatest gold camp of them all.  beyond the shark-tooth ranges sawing savage at the sky there’s a lowering land no white man ever struck; there’s gold, there’s gold in millions, and i’ll find it if i die. and i’m going there once more to try my luck. maybe i’ll fail — what matter? it’s a mandate, it’s a vow; and when in lands of dreariness and dread you seek the last lone frontier, far beyond your frontiers now, you will find the old prospector, silent, dead.  you will find a tattered tent-pole with a ragged robe below it; you will find a rusted gold-pan on the sod; you will find the claim i’m seeking, with my bones as stakes to show it; but i’ve sought the last recorder, and he’s — god.  
NEW POEM
 the irritations of comfort— i visit as they rebuild the house from within: whitening, straightening, bracing the chimney-breast edges and forcing warmth, dryness and windows with views into the cottage below canal-level.  for yes, there’s a canal, bringing cold reflections almost to the door, and beyond it the main line to manchester, its grid of gantries pale against the upland and the sky; there’s a towpath pub, where the red- haired old landlady brings up the beer from the cellar slowly in a jug: there’s a chapel next door to the cottage, set up with a false front and a real boiler-house, and— rest, my mind—nearby there’s a small haulage contractor’s yard.  everything’s turned up here, except a certain complete cast-iron housefront, preserved and pinned to a blank wall in ottawa.  this comfort beckons. it won’t do. it beckons. driving steadily through rain in a watertight car with the wipers going. it won’t do. it beckons.

 the porter in the pullman car was charming, as they sometimes are. he scanned my baggage tags: “are you the man who wrote of lady lou?” when i said “yes” he made a fuss — oh, he was most assiduous; and i was pleased to think that he enjoyed my brand of poetry.  he was forever at my call, so when we got to montreal and he had brushed me off, i said: “i’m glad my poems you have read, i feel quite flattered, i confess, and if you give me your address i’ll send you (autographed, of course) one of my little books of verse.”  he smiled — his teeth were white as milk; he spoke — his voice was soft as silk. i recognized, despite his skin, the perfect gentleman within. then courteously he made reply: “i thank you kindly, sir, but i with many other cherished tome have all your books of verse at home.  “when i was quite a little boy i used to savour them with joy; and now my daughter, aged three, can tell the tale of sam mcgee; while tom, my son, that’s only two, has heard the yarn of dan mcgrew .... don’t think your stuff i’m not applaudin’ — my taste is eliot and auden.”  so as we gravely bade adieu i felt quite snubbed — and so would you. and yet i shook him by the hand, impressed that he could understand the works of those two tops i mention, so far beyond my comprehension — a humble bard of boys and barmen, disdained, alas! by pullman carmen.  
NEW POEM
 seeing my friend’s son in his broad-brimmed hat and suspenders, i think of the quakers who lectured us on nonviolent social action every week when i was a child. in the classrooms we listened to those who would not take up arms, who objected, who had accepted alternative service in distant work camps and showed slides of hospitals they helped to build. on wednesdays, in meeting for worship, when someone rose to speak, all the energy in the room flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell what she had seen on her brief encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable, a riddle, a kindness. the fall that we were seventeen, we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path from the meetinghouse, while maple and elm leaves sailed around our shoulders like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside. despite the war in vietnam, i felt safer than i ever would again. perhaps those aged, protective trees had cast a spell on us, or maybe the nonviolent quaker god had set up a kingdom right there— suburban philadelphia. looking back, i see how good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic room for latin, descended to the gym for sports, where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds of righteous behavior. we prepared to leave for college, armed with the language of the american friends and the memories of thanksgiving dinners we’d cooked for the unfortunates: borrowing our parents’ cars to drive downtown to the drop-off point, racing back to play our last field hockey match. grim center forwards shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs’ knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.  
NEW POEM
 i’m having trouble understanding the wife. the wife seems like she is only there as a foil to your actions. i want to know how the wife feels when you drag her and your son down into the basement to start a new religion. the religion has something to do with cowering before a force greater than yourself and then being buried alive. i want to know how the wife behaves in small, enclosed spaces: if she is trying to comfort your son by telling him daddy likes to play funny games, or if she is already visualizing herself walking into a women’s shelter, your son on her back and maybe, because this is a fantasy, she carries a burning torch, like an angry villager, or a goddess. does the wife merit any revenge after you weed whack the coffee table? does she agree with you that the coffee table is yours to destroy because you built it? what has she built in the house that is hers to destroy? what kind of childhood has the wife endured that allows her to understand you? in her past life or lives, was the wife ever a shepherdess? does she see you as a sort of pan, goatish, and pricked by ticks, but also very well-endowed? when the wife transforms into a tree can she still think or is she just a green haze inside, an idea of growing? i would like to see the wife peel off that bark, leaving only enough for modesty’s sake, although as this is your poem, we can take a bit more off. i want to see her uproot herself, pick up the house and shake it. how many people fall out? the wife has something about her the germans would call unheimlich. i sometimes catch a glimpse of the wife out of the corner of my eye but then i look away. i cannot look directly at the wife. the wife is a conflagration of everything dear. i wonder sometimes if she is faking; there is a certain note she holds too long so the orgasm is more operatic, less genuine. when she cries,oh my god, really, she should stutter. let’s say the wife wakes up in the morning. you have already made breakfast. does your kindness feel oppressive? does she want to take your weed whacker through the house? has she ever, in a fit of anger, destroyed your pornography? when you found a picture of the wife online with a foreign handprint smacked red on her ass, how quickly did your shock turn to arousal? are you aware the wife is breaking down in public places, and sometimes cannot move for thirty minutes? sometimes her arm goes entirely numb from the shoulder down. i think the wife might need some fine-tuning, some elbow grease, some wrenching apart, and then reassembling.

 this sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the mongolian camel. “fancy-schmancy,” my father would have said, whose snazziest sweater was still a declassé synthetic from the sweatshops of taiwan. my friend deloris, however, who really owns such clothes, would say “exquisite” or “sublime”—her opened closet’s row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more than her wardrobe’s tasteful accessories. “. . . woven from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then hand-sewn in our undersea domes.” “untouched by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . .”  ______________   rarefied—to helthi hart, the diet guru, it’s a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. and for the emperor excessia, it’s a mad dessert of swans’ tongues —there were, what? ten thousand?—dipped in a slip of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers like a field of fresh shoots they could graze. some roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe. they might even allow the household slaves to slide leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate into their shoulders all down the mountainside.  ______________  afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter. but an image of my father’s worn-thin bargain city “all-weather” jacket is still whole in its polyester glory. this is what happened: the alley dog (he later called the thing a “cur”) had cornered livia, and she screamed once, with a seven-year-old’s unselfconscious terror. and then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm, and a rock. when it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog quiet and, after comforting livia, they both kneeled down to comfort the dog. he was like that. and the jacket that served as weapon and restraint?—was like him, every day of his life. it did what was needed.  ______________   i misread “migraine.” which of the two would we call the most rarefied? “margarine”? or maybe comparison isn’t the point. a ghost is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander death; that doesn’t make, for most of us, extinction an ideal. it was hard to think of frank and deloris divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy with the rest of the hoi polloi. they seemed unearthly in close to a literal way, like radio waves. and yet divorce they did. they found something real they could unjoin, hertz from hertz until there just was air.  ______________  a dream: we own the softest of the soft mongolian camel underhair sweaters. one day (we think we’re doing the “right thing”) we release it into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister desert sweaters, out where it “belongs.” you know, however, what happens by now: it’s unfit to fend for itself amid that hardened herd. they beat it. it’s hungry. it crawls back into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside, wraps it in flannel. that’s how he was. he’d give you the cheap shirt off his back.

 black reapers with the sound of steel on stones are sharpening scythes. i see them place the hones in their hip-pockets as a thing that’s done, and start their silent swinging, one by one. black horses drive a mower through the weeds, and there, a field rat, startled, squealing bleeds. his belly close to ground. i see the blade, blood-stained, continue cutting weeds and shade.

 that is why i am here not among the ibises. why the permanent city parasol covers even me.  it was the rains in the occult season. it was the snows on the lower slopes. it was water and cold in my mouth.  a lack of shoes on what appeared to be cobbles which were still antique  well wild wild whatever in wild more silent blue  the vase grips the stems petals fall    the chrysanthemum darkens  sometimes this mustard feeling clutches me also. my sleep is reckoned in straws  yet i wake up and am followed into the street.

 all the sioux were defeated. our clan got poor, but a few got richer. they fought two wars. i did not take part. no one remembers your vision or even your real name. now the children go to town and like loud music. i married a christian.  crazy horse, it is not fair to hide a new vision from you. in our schools we are learning to take aim when we talk, and we have found out our enemies. they shift when words do; they even change and hide in every person. a teacher here says hurt or scorned people are places where real enemies hide. he says we should not hurt or scorn anyone, but help them. and i will tell you in a brave way, the way crazy horse talked: that teacher is right.  i will tell you a strange thing: at the rodeo, close to the grandstand, i saw a farm lady scared by a blown piece of paper; and at that place horses and policemen were no longer frightening, but suffering faces were, and the hunched-over backs of the old.  crazy horse, tell me if i am right: these are the things we thought we were doing something about.  in your life you saw many strange things, and i will tell you another: now i salute the white man’s flag. but when i salute i hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat and remember all of us and how we depend on a steady pulse together. there are those who salute because they fear other flags or mean to use ours to chase them: i must not allow my part of saluting to mean this. all of our promises, our generous sayings to each other, our honorable intentions—those i affirm when i salute. at these times it is like shutting my eyes and joining a religious colony at prayer in the gray dawn in the deep aisles of a church.  now i have told you about new times. yes, i know others will report different things. they have been caught by weak ways. i tell you straight the way it is now, and it is our way, the way we were trying to find.  the chokecherries along our valley still bear a bright fruit. there is good pottery clay north of here. i remember our old places. when i pass the musselshell i run my hand along those old grooves in the rock.  
NEW POEM
 we, the research assistants and teaching assistants of the university of california, wish to register our protest against the new loyalty oath for the following reasons.  1) the testing of a university faculty by oath is a stupid and insulting procedure. if this oath is to have the effect of eliminating communists from the faculty, we might as logically eliminate murderers from the faculty by forcing every faculty member to sign an oath saying that he has never committed murder.  2) that such an oath is more dangerous to the liberties of the community than any number of active communists should be obvious to any student of history. liberty and democracy are more often overthrown by fear than by stealth. only countries such as russia or spain have institutions so weak and unhealthy that they must be protected by terror.  3) oaths and other forms of blackmail are destructive to the free working of man's intellect. since the early middle ages universities have zealously guarded their intellectual freedom and have made use of its power to help create the world we know today. the oath that galileo was forced by the inquisition to swear is but a distant cousin to the oath we are asked to swear today, but both represent the struggle of the blind and powerful against the minds of free men.  we, who will inherit the branches of learning that one thousand years of free universities have helped to generate, are not communists and dislike the oath for the same reason we dislike communism. both breed stupidity and indignity; both threaten our personal and intellectual freedom.

 this earth the king said looking at the ground; this england. but we drive a sunday paradise of parkway, trees flow into trees and the grass like water by the very asphalt crown and summit of things in the flow of traffic the family cars, in the dim sound of the living the noise of increase to which we owe what we possess. we cannot reconcile ourselves. no one is reconciled, tho we spring from the ground together—  and we saw the seed, the minuscule sequoia seed in the museum by the tremendous slab of the tree. and imagined the seed in soil and the growth quickened so that we saw the seed reach out, forcing earth thru itself into bark, wood, the green needles of a redwood until the tree stood in the room without soil— how much of the earth's crust has lived the seed’s violence! the shock is metaphysical.  for the wood weathers. drift wood and the foot print in the forest grow older. this is not our time, not what we mean, it is a time passing, the curl at the cutwater, the enormous prow outside in the weather. in that breeze, the sense of that passage, is desertion, betrayal, that we are not innocent of loneliness as pierrot, pierrette chattering unaware tho we imagine nothing beyond the streets of the living— a sap in the limbs. mary, mary, we turn to the children as they will turn to the children wanting so much to have created happiness as if a stem to the leaves—  —we had camped in scrub, a scrub of the past, the fringes of towns neither towns nor forest, nothing ours. and linda five, maybe six when the mare grazing in the meadow came to her. ‘horse,’ she said, whispering by the roadside with the cars passing. little girl welcomed, learning welcome. the rest is—  whatever—whatever—remote mechanics, endurance, the piers of the city in the sea. here are whole buildings razed, whole blocks of a city gone among old streets and the old boroughs, ourselves among these streets where petra beat a washpan out her window gathering a crowd like a rescue. relief, as they said it, the relief. petra decisive suddenly among her children in those crumbling bedrooms, petra, petra—. and how imagine it? or imagine coughlin in the streets, pelley and the silver shirts? the medieval sense seems innocent, the very ceremony of innocence that was drowned. it was not. but how imagine it of streets boarded and vacant where no time will hatch now chairs and walls, floors, roofs, the joists and beams, the woodwork, window sills in sun in a great weight of brick.

 platanal, 1974, by myrna báez considering myrna báez’s painting platanal, e. carmen ramos explains, “when puerto rico was a spanish colony, artists like francisco oller depicted the plantain as both a key accoutrement to the jibaro (rural peasant) and a metaphor for the island’s independent cultural identity.”    plantain trees gather at the edge of the orchard, clamor for light  in the foreground. they seem to grow as one, as if they’d fill the field  and the mountains behind them, leaves large and frayed. we stood  there, once, or someplace like it, so here we are again, it seems,  years later, branches leaning over the road, you in your long skirt,  looking out as if to recall something you meant to do.my country, i hear  you say still. but if that’s dusk in the hills, you know what’s  coming to the field. you’ll stand among them till there’s nothing left  to see. i’ll wait beside you, though i don’t know what we’re waiting for.

 johannes brahms and clara schumann the modern biographers worry “how far it went,” their tender friendship. they wonder just what it means when he writes he thinks of her constantly, his guardian angel, beloved friend. the modern biographers ask the rude, irrelevant question of our age, as if the event of two bodies meshing together establishes the degree of love, forgetting how softly eros walked in the nineteenth-century, how a hand held overlong or a gaze anchored in someone’s eyes could unseat a heart, and nuances of address not known in our egalitarian language could make the redolent air tremble and shimmer with the heat of possibility. each time i hear the intermezzi, sad and lavish in their tenderness, i imagine the two of them sitting in a garden among late-blooming roses and dark cascades of leaves, letting the landscape speak for them, leaving us nothing to overhear.

 this is for the pullman porters who organized when people said they couldn’t. and carried the pittsburgh courier and the chicagodefender to the black americans in the south so they would know they were not alone. this is for the pullman porters who helped thurgood marshall go south and come back north to fight the fight that resulted in brown v. board of education because even though kansas is west and even though topeka is the birth- place of gwendolyn brooks, who wrote the powerful “the chicago defender sends a man to little rock,” it was the pullman porters who whispered to the traveling men both the blues men and the “race” men so that they both would know what was going on. this is for the pullman porters who smiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled when some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 1954 when the supreme court announced its 9—0 decision that “sepa- rate is inherently unequal.” this is for the pullman porters who smiled and welcomed a fourteen-year-old boy onto their train in 1955. they noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a doo-wop walk; they noticed his stutter and probably understood why his mother wanted him out of chicago during the summer when school was out. fourteen-year-old black boys with limps and stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways when mothers aren’t around to look after them. so this is for the pullman porters who looked over that fourteen-year-old while the train rolled the reverse of the blues highway from chicago to st. louis to memphis to mississippi. this is for the men who kept him safe; and if emmett till had been able to stay on a train all summer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch, certainly lost his hair, probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand- children on his knee telling them about his summer riding the rails. but he had to get off the train. and ended up in money, mississippi. and was horribly, brutally, inexcusably, and unac- ceptably murdered. this is for the pullman porters who, when the sheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried, got emmett’s body on the northbound train, got his body home to chicago, where his mother said: i want the world to see what they did to my boy. and this is for all the mothers who cried. and this is for all the people who said never again. and this is about rosa parks whose feet were not so tired, it had been, after all, an ordi- nary day, until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make history. this is about mrs. rosa parks from tuskegee, alabama, who was also the field secretary of the naacp. this is about the moment rosa parks shouldered her cross, put her worldly goods aside, was willing to sacrifice her life, so that that young man in money, mississippi, who had been so well protected by the pullman porters, would not have died in vain. when mrs. parks said “no” a passionate movement was begun. no longer would there be a reliance on the law; there was a higher law. when mrs. parks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system, the sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and the light of truth. others would follow mrs. parks. four young men in greensboro, north carolina, would also say no. great voices would be raised singing the praises of god and exhorting us “to forgive those who trespass against us.” but it was the pullman porters who safely got emmett to his granduncle and it was mrs. rosa parks who could not stand that death. and in not being able to stand it. she sat back down.

 there is no escaping the storm of roses crisscrossed on the split-cracked wall of a dead fountain arch. there is no escaping their uterine balls, expanding as a reminder of the children i never had. if you listen carefully you can hear the vibrations, the heart drone of their petal jaw-harps. and there’s no going back, no indiscovery of mars or these red planets brooding before me, light predators, sun-hatched and bloodening like the fists of women who have gone to war.

 who has the moral high ground?  fifteen blocks from the whitehouse on small corners in northwest, d.c. boys disguised as me rip each other’s hearts out with weapons made in china. they fight for territory.  across the planet in a land where civilization was born the boys of d.c. know nothing about their distant relatives in rwanda. they have never heard of the hutu or tutsi people. their eyes draw blanks at the mention of kigali, byumba or butare. all they know are the streets of d.c., and do not cry at funerals anymore. numbers and frequency have a way of making murder commonplace and not news unless it spreads outside of our house, block, territory.  modern massacres are intraethnic. bosnia, sri lanka, burundi, nagorno-karabakh, iraq, laos, angola, liberia, and rwanda are small foreign names on a map made in europe. when bodies by the tens of thousands float down a river turning the water the color of blood, as a quarter of a million people flee barefoot into tanzania and zaire, somehow we notice. we do not smile, we have no more tears. we hold our thoughts. in deeply muted silence looking south and thinking that today nelson mandela seems much larger than he is.

 for tony i could not disengage my world from the rest of humanity. wind chill factor 11° below. all night wind thrashes barechested trees like a west texas tent evangelist hissing them on his knees, lisping sinnn . . . sinn . . . sinn . . . all night wind preaches.  old tool shed behind my house fist-cuffs itself to nail-loose tin, horse pasture gates clank their crimes, while neighing black stallions of rain stampede on the patio fleeing gunshots of thunder . . . .  miles south of here, nightscopes pick up human heat that green fuzz helicopter dash panels. a mother whispers, “sssshhhh mejito, nomás poco más allá. nomás poco más allá.” dunes of playing-dead people jack rabbit under strobe lights and cutting whack/blades, “ssshhh mejito. sssshhhh.” child whimpers and staggers in blinding dust and gnashing wind.  those not caught, scratch sand up to sleep against underbellies of roots and stones.  eventually juanito comes to my door, sick from eating stucco chips— his meals scratched off walls of temporary shelters, and enrique, who guzzled water at industrial pipes pouring green foam out at the el paso/juarez border, and maria steaming with fever, face dark meteorite, whispers, “where i come from, señor baca, a woman’s womb is a rock, and children born from me, drop like stones, to become dust under death squad’s boots.”  and juanito, “they came at midnight and took my brothers. i have never seen them since. each judge’s tongue is a bleeding stub of death, and each lawyer’s finger a soft coffin nail.”  and enrique, “you can trust no one. each crying person’s eye is a damp cellar where thieves and murderers sleep.”  they have found refuge here at black mesa.  the sun passes between our lives, as between two trees, one gray, one green, but side by side.

 look straight, and don’t tremble, wreckage of my hanged race: a sarabande dancer, japanese muslin tight on her live-wire hips arrives with the moonlight, fast as the tam-tam drums. she’ll take you to the grand esplanade where the gallows tell your story, tell of your dim bronze halos licked away by a pale man’s greed.  leave your gallows tears behind, the long-drawn vowels of the lost names of flowers, the long-drawn cries of your burden of grain, the long-drawn cries of your burden of seed-pods, and the long-drawn cries of the seed-pods cut and hung. shipwreck of my race, twisted in the wind-rush, fall from your broken gallows, wrack, wreck, and driftwood, my bloodied race. my bloodied race fearful, scab-dried, sterile, paralyzed, the low-caste wallflowers trembling at a ball for mice— no. leave your gallows, there, those: the gallows of time-gone-by. lift your chestnut-dark and heavy limbs, up from out the shipwreck’s carnage, and up through those long blue-green rolling waves. sing the wind’s songs, and collect what’s needed, drop by shivering drop, in this, your lenten fasting, in this, your sorcerer’s midnight, under this, the whip. leave the gallows, the sap of its cut-wood spits on your skin. you’d hang there, yourself in effigy? no. live sap runs in the driftwood branch. you’ll play, gentle, a light wind in the shimmering green of a dancer’s beaded muslin skirt, and your broken music will move in the foolish grass that still believes in death— leave your gallows-bones there, in the fool’s green shroud . . . scratch with the rusted nail of melody, because you live, wreckage of my race, the sky will not forget you, nor the graveyard’s earth, fertile and walled. your blood still dances, a wreckage of joy, joy soured, obstinate joy, wild and unbroken, shipwreck of my race, sarabande.

 bury your heart in some deep green hollow or hide it up in a kind old tree; better still, give it the swallow when she goes over the sea.  in saturday’s market there’s eggs a ’plenty and dead-alive ducks with their legs tied down, grey old gaffers and boys of twenty— girls and the women of the town— pitchers and sugar-sticks, ribbons and laces, poises and whips and dicky-birds’ seed, silver pieces and smiling faces, in saturday market they’ve all they need.  what were you showing in saturday market that set it grinning from end to end girls and gaffers and boys of twenty—? cover it close with your shawl, my friend— hasten you home with the laugh behind you, over the down—, out of sight, fasten your door, though no one will find you, no one will look on a market night.  see, you, the shawl is wet, take out from under the red dead thing—. in the white of the moon on the flags does it stir again? well, and no wonder! best make an end of it; bury it soon. if there is blood on the hearth who’ll know it? or blood on the stairs, when a murder is over and done why show it? in saturday market nobody cares.  then lie you straight on your bed for a short, short weeping and still, for a long, long rest, there’s never a one in the town so sure of sleeping as you, in the house on the down with a hole in your breast.  think no more of the swallow, forget, you, the sea, never again remember the deep green hollow or the top of the kind old tree!

 everyone comes here from a long way off (is a line from a poem i read last night).   *     *     *  driving up 80 in the haze, they talked and talked. (smoke in the air shimmering from wildfires.) his story was sad and hers was roiled, troubled.  *     *     *  alternatively:  a man and a woman, old friends, are in a theater watching a movie in which a man and a woman, old friends, are driving through summer on a mountain road. the woman is describing the end of her marriage and sobbing, shaking her head and laughing and sobbing. the man is watching the road, listening, his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance, and because, in the restaurant before the film the woman had been describing the end of her marriage and cried, they are not sure whether they are in the theater or on the mountain road, and when the timber truck comes suddenly around the bend, they both flinch.  *     *     *  he found that it was no good trying to tell what happened that day. everything he said seemed fictional the moment that he said it, the rain, the scent of her hair, what she said as she was leaving, and why it was important for him to explain that the car had been parked under eucalyptus on a hillside, and how velvety and blurred the trees looked through the windshield; not, he said, that making fictions might not be the best way of getting at it, but that nothing he said had the brute, abject, unassimilated quality of a wounding experience: the ego in any telling was already seeing itself as a character, and a character, he said, was exactly what he was not at that moment, even as he kept wanting to explain to someone, to whomever would listen, that she had closed the door so quietly and so firmly that the beads of rain on the side window didn’t even quiver.  *     *     *  names for involuntary movements of the body— squirm, wince, flinch, and shudder— sound like a law firm in dickens: “mr. flinch took off his black gloves as if he were skinning his hands.” “quiver dipped the nib of his pen into the throat of the inkwell.”  *     *     *  the receptionist at the hospital morgue told him to call the city medical examiner’s office, but you only got a recorded voice on weekends.  *     *     *  setup without the punchline:  three greenhorns are being measured for suits by a very large tailor on hester street.  *     *     *  once there were two sisters called knock me and sock me; their best friend was a bear named always arguing. what kind of animals were the sisters? one child asked. maybe they could be raccoons, said the other. or pandas, said the first. they could be pandas.  *     *     *  “why?” he asked. “because she was lonely, and angry,” said the friend who knew her better, “and she’d run out of stories. or come to the one story.”  *     *     *  it is good to sit down to birthday cake with children, who think it is the entire point of life and who, therefore, respect each detail of the ceremony. there ought to be a rule, he thought, for who gets to lick the knife that cuts the cake and the rule should have its pattern somewhere in the winter stars. which do you add to the tea first, he’d asked, the sugar or the milk? and the child had said, instantly: “the milk.” (laws as cool and angular as words:angular,sidereal.)  *     *     *  stories about the distribution of wealth: once upon a time there was an old man and an old women who were very, very poor.  *     *     *  how eldie got her name  the neighborhood had been so dangerous, she said, there was one summer when the mailmen refused to deliver the mail. her mother never appeared and her grandmother, who had bought a handgun for protection and had also taught her how to use it, would walk her to the post office for the sweet, singsong, half-rhymed letters that smelled, or that she imagined smelled, of florida. she had, when she was ten, shot at an intruder climbing in the window. the roar, she said, was tremendous and she doesn’t know to this day whether she hit the man or not. (a big-boned young woman, skin the color of the inside of some light-colored hazelnut confection, auburn eyes, some plucked string of melancholy radiating from her whole body when she spoke.) did her mama come back? they had asked. she never came back. the mail started up again but the letters stopped. turned out she was good in school, and that was what saved her. she loved the labor of schoolwork. loved finishing a project and contemplating the neatness of her script. her grandmother shook her head, sometimes, amused and proud, and called her “little diligence.”  *     *     *  punchline without the setup: and the three nuns from immaculate conception nodded and smiled as they passed, because they thought he was addressing them in latin.  *     *     *  he had known, as long as he’d known anything, that he had a father somewhere. when he was twelve, his mother told him why he had no shadow.  *     *     *  because she, not her sister, answered the door, she was the first to hear the news.  *     *     *  a ballad:  he loved to watch that woman sew. she let her hair grow long for show. riddle’s a needle (a refrain might go) and plainly said is thread.  *     *     *  she looked beautiful, and looked her age, too. she’d had a go at putting herself together; she had always had the confidence that, with a face like hers, a few touches to represent the idea of a put-together look would do, like some set designer’s genius minimalism. it had a slightly harridan effect and he remembered that it wasn’t what was headlong or slapdash about her, but the way they gestured, like a quotation, at an understanding of elegance it would have been boring to spell out, that had at first dazzled him about her. he felt himself stirring at this recognition, and at a certain memory that attended it, and then laughed at the thought that he had actually stimulated himself with an analysis of her style, and she said, as if she were remembering the way he could make her insecure, “what? what are you smiling about?” and he said, “nothing.” and she said, “oh, yes. right. i remember nothing.”  *     *     *  two jokes walk into a bar.  a cage went in search of a bird.  a boy walks out in the morning with a gun.  three rabbis walk into a penguin.  *     *     *  in the other world the girls were named eleanor and filina, and one night it was very warm and they could not sleep for the heat and the stillness, and they went outside, beyond the wall of their parents’ garden and into a meadow. it was a dark night, moonless, and the stars were so thick they seemed to shudder, and the sisters stood a long time in the sweet smell of the cooling grasses, looking at the sky and listening in the silence. after a while they heard a stirring and saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching them from the woods’ edge. “maybe it’s their friend, the bear,” one of the children said. “i don’t like this story,” said the other.

 how long it must have been, the girl’s hair, cascading down her shoulders almost to her waist, light brown and heavy as brocade: the story i’m  remembering of n’s, remembering as my own hair’s washed and cut, the salt-and-pepper cuneiform to frill my barber’s smock.  arts and science is expanding. the wall to the empty shop next door pulled down and a dozen workmen slink improbably  on scaffolds butting the dusty ceiling, cacophony and plastic tarps, the whirr of drills that mingles with the dryers’  jittery hums, the scissors’ flash, veronicas of clicks, the coloring, the curling, the antique cash register,  melodious with its chime. and best, the liquid gurgle of hands massaging scalps the row of sinks, twelve hands and six  wet scalps in a line. i’m next, and leaning back (let me wash it in this big tin basin, battered and shiny like the moon)

 the sale began—young girls were there, defenseless in their wretchedness, whose stifled sobs of deep despair revealed their anguish and distress.  and mothers stood, with streaming eyes, and saw their dearest children sold; unheeded rose their bitter cries, while tyrants bartered them for gold.  and woman, with her love and truth— for these in sable forms may dwell— gazed on the husband of her youth, with anguish none may paint or tell.  and men, whose sole crime was their hue, the impress of their maker’s hand, and frail and shrinking children too, were gathered in that mournful band.  ye who have laid your loved to rest, and wept above their lifeless clay, know not the anguish of that breast, whose loved are rudely torn away.  ye may not know how desolate are bosoms rudely forced to part, and how a dull and heavy weight will press the life-drops from the heart.

 between what should and what should not be everything is liable to explode. many times i was told who has no land has no sea. my father learned to fly in a dream. this is the story of a sycamore tree he used to climb when he was young to watch the rain.  sometimes it rained so hard it hurt. like being beaten with sticks. then the mud would run red.  my brother believed bad dreams could kill a man in his sleep, he insisted we wake my father from his muffled screams on the night of the day he took us to see his village. no longer his village he found his tree amputated. between one falling and the next  there’s a weightless state. there was a woman who loved me. asked me how to say tree in arabic. i didn’t tell her. she was sad. i didn’t understand. when she left. i saw a man in my sleep three times. a man i knew could turn anyone into one-half reptile. i was immune. i thought i was. i was terrified of being  the only one left. when we woke my father he was running away from soldiers. now he doesn’t remember that night. he laughs about another sleep, he raised his arms to strike a king and tried not to stop. he flew but mother woke him and held him for an hour,  or half an hour, or as long as it takes a migration inward. maybe if i had just said it. shejerah, she would’ve remembered me longer. maybe i don’t know much about dreams but my mother taught me the law of omen. the dead know about the dying and sometimes catch them in sleep like the sycamore tree my father used to climb  when he was young to watch the rain stream, and he would gently swing.

 head to limp head, the sunk-eyed wounded scanned yesterday's mail; the casualties (typed small) and (large) vast booty from our latest haul. also, they read of cheap homes, not yet planned; “for,” said the paper, “when this war is done the men's first instinct will be making homes. meanwhile their foremost need is aerodromes, it being certain war has just begun. peace would do wrong to our undying dead,— the sons we offered might regret they died if we got nothing lasting in their stead. we must be solidly indemnified. though all be worthy victory which all bought. we rulers sitting in this ancient spot would wrong our very selves if we forgot the greatest glory will be theirs who fought, who kept this nation in integrity.” nation?—the half-limbed readers did not chafe but smiled at one another curiously like secret men who know their secret safe. (this is the thing they know and never speak, that england one by one had fled to france not many elsewhere now save under france). pictures of these broad smiles appear each week, and people in whose voice real feeling rings say: how they smile! they're happy now, poor things.

 over there, trees are sheltering a hunchedback hut... a slum, no more... roof askew, walls and wainscoting falling away... moss hides the door.  only one shutter, hanging... but seeping over the windowsill, like frosted breath, proof that this hut, this slum, is living, breathing still.  corkscrew of smoke... a wisp of blue escapes the hovel, whose soul it is... rises to god himself, and who receives the news and makes it his.

 he’s brought me to hear his band. he sits in a corner mouthing his clarinet. a hellish racket begins. outside, through flashes of lightning, wind gusts and rain whips, knocking the lights out every five minutes. in the dark, their faces give it their all, contorted, as they play a dance tune from memory. full of energy, my poor friend anchors them all from behind. his clarinet writhes, breaks through the din, passes beyond it, releasing like a lone soul, into a dry, rough silence.  the poor pieces of brass have been dented too often: the hands working the stops also work in the fields, and the obstinate brows stay fixed on the ground. miserable worn-out blood, weakened by too many labors—you can hear it groan in their notes, as my friend struggles to lead them, his own hands hardened from swinging a hammer, from pushing a plane, from scraping a living.  he’s lost all his old comrades, and he’s only thirty. part of the postwar group that grew up on hunger. they all came to turin, to look for a life, and discovered injustice. he learned, without smiling, how to work in a factory. he learned how to measure the hunger of others with his own fatigue— injustice was everywhere. he tried to find peace by walking, at night, down streets without ends, half-asleep, but found only thousands of streetlamps blazing down on iniquity: hoarse women and drunks, staggering puppets, far from their homes, he came, one winter, to turin—factory lights, smoke and ash— and he learned what work is. he accepted that work was part of a man’s hard fate; if all men did that, there just might be some justice in this world. and he found new comrades. he suffered their long words, he listened and waited for them to be over. he made them his comrades. families of them in each house, the city surrounded by them, the face of the world covered with them. and each of them felt desperate enough to conquer the world.  they sound harsh tonight, despite all the time he spent coaching each player. he ignores the loud rain and the flickering lights. his face is severe, fixed on some grief, almost biting the mouthpiece. i’ve seen this expression before, one evening, just us and his brother, who’s ten years sadder than him. we were up late in the dim light, the brother studying a lathe he had built that didn’t work right, and my poor friend cursing the fate that kept him there, bound to his hammer and plane, feeding a pair of old people he never asked for. that’s when he yelled that it wasn’t fate that made the world suffer or made the daylight spark blasphemous outbursts: man is the guilty one.if we only could just leave, and be hungry and free, and say no to a life that uses our love and our piety, our families, our patches of dirt, to shackle our hands.

 talking, we begin to find the way into our hearts, we who knew no words, words being a rare commodity in those countries we left behind.  both refugees and similarly deprived, we marvel at the many things there are to say: so many variations and colors of the same thought, so  many different lengths in the words that line up together on our tongues. no scarcity, no rationing, no waiting in line in order to buy  the same answer we heard each time we asked, that one word, owned by the state, manufactured by the state, serving all purposes equally alike: no, no, no, and sometimes never.

 for my wife after the storm, after the rain stopped pounding, we stood in the doorway watching horses walk off lazily across the pasture’s hill. we stared through the black screen, our vision altered by the distance so i thought i saw a mist kicked up around their hooves when they faded like cut-out horses away from us. the grass was never more blue in that light, more scarlet; beyond the pasture trees scraped their voices into the wind, branches crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire but you said they were only branches.  okay. the storm stopped pounding. i am trying to say this straight: for once i was sane enough to pause and breathe outside my wild plans and after the hard rain i turned my back on the old curses. i believed they swung finally away from me ...  but still the branches are wire and thunder is the pounding mortar, still i close my eyes and see the girl running from her village, napalm stuck to her dress like jelly, her hands reaching for the no one who waits in waves of heat before her.  so i can keep on living, so i can stay here beside you, i try to imagine she runs down the road and wings beat inside her until she rises above the stinking jungle and her pain eases, and your pain, and mine.  but the lie swings back again. the lie works only as long as it takes to speak and the girl runs only as far as the napalm allows until her burning tendons and crackling muscles draw her up into that final position  burning bodies so perfectly assume. nothing can change that; she is burned behind my eyes and not your good love and not the rain-swept air and not the jungle green pasture unfolding before us can deny it.

 no wise man ever wished to be younger. — swift 1  down the long library each marble bust shines unregarded through a shower of dust where a grim ghost paces for exercise in wet weather: nausea, gout, ‘some days i hardly think it worth my time to rise’. not even the love of friends can quite appease the vertigo, sore ears and inner voices; deep-draughted rain clouds, a rock lost in space, yahoos triumphant in the marketplace, the isle is full of intolerable noises.   2  go with the flow; no, going against the grain he sits in his rocking chair with a migraine, a light in the church all day till evensong, the sort of day in which a man might hang. no riding out to bubbling stream and weir, to the moist meadow and white belvedere; on tattling club and coffee house a pox, a confederacy of dunces and mohocks — scholars and saints be d-mn’d, slaves to a hard reign and our own miniature self-regard.   3  we emerge from hibernation to ghetto-blasters much better than our old sony transistors, consensual media, permanent celebration, share options, electronic animation, wave motion of site-specific daffodils, closed-circuit video in the new hotels; for niamh and oisín have come to earth once more with blinding breastplate and tempestuous hair, new festive orthodoxy and ironic icon, their faces lit up like the book of kells.   4  defrosting the goose-skin on bridget’s daughters spring sunlight sparkles among parking meters, wizards on stilts, witches on circus bikes, jokers and jugglers, twitching plastic snakes, pop music of what happens, throbbing skies, star wars, designer genes, sword sorceries. we’ve no nostalgia for the patristic croziers, fridges and tumble-dryers of former years, rain-spattered cameras in o’connell st., the sound mikes buffeted by wind and sleet —   5  but this is your birthday and i want to recall a first-floor balcony under a shower of hail where our own rowdy crowd stood to review post-christian gays cavorting up fifth avenue, wise-cracking dialogue as quick and dry as that in the big sleep or the long goodbye; for we too had our season in tír na nóg, a sacred heart girl and a protestant rogue, chill sunshine warming us to the very bone, our whole existence one erogenous zone.   6  i could resign these structures and devices, these fancy flourishes and funny voices to a post-literate, audio-visual realm of uncial fluorescence, song and film, as curious symptoms of a weird transition before we opted to be slaves of fashion — for now, whatever the ancestral dream, we give ourselves to a vast corporate scheme where our true wit is devalued once again, our solitude known only to the rain.   7  the one reality is the perpetual flow, chaos of complex systems. each generation does what it must; middle age and misanthropy, like famine and religion, make poor copy, and even the present vanishes like snow off a rope, frost off a ditch, ice in the sun — so back to the desktop and the drawing board, prismatic natural light, slow-moving cloud, the waves far-thundering in a life of their own, a young woman hitching a lift on a country road.

 every town with black catholics has a st. peter claver’s. my first was nursery school. miss maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots. no mother questioned; no child sassed. in blue pleated skirts, pants, and white shirts, we stood in line to use the open toilets and conserved light by walking in darkness. unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents’ places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait. they said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty whiteness; i learned to swallow and distrust my senses.  on holy cards st. peter’s face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky; i thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and dark. now i read he was “a spanish jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the african negroes and the abolition of the slave trade.” i was tricked again, robbed of my patron, and left with a debt to another white man.

 through alpine meadows soft-suffused with rain, where thick the crocus blows, past the dark forges long disused, the mule-track from saint laurent goes. the bridge is cross'd, and slow we ride, through forest, up the mountain-side.  the autumnal evening darkens round, the wind is up, and drives the rain; while, hark! far down, with strangled sound doth the dead guier's stream complain, where that wet smoke, among the woods, over his boiling cauldron broods.  swift rush the spectral vapours white past limestone scars with ragged pines, showing—then blotting from our sight!— halt—through the cloud-drift something shines! high in the valley, wet and drear, the huts of courrerie appear.  strike leftward! cries our guide; and higher mounts up the stony forest-way. at last the encircling trees retire; look! through the showery twilight grey what pointed roofs are these advance?— a palace of the kings of france?  approach, for what we seek is here! alight, and sparely sup, and wait for rest in this outbuilding near; then cross the sward and reach that gate. knock; pass the wicket! thou art come to the carthusians' world-famed home.  the silent courts, where night and day into their stone-carved basins cold the splashing icy fountains play— the humid corridors behold! where, ghostlike in the deepening night, cowl'd forms brush by in gleaming white.  the chapel, where no organ's peal invests the stern and naked prayer— with penitential cries they kneel and wrestle; rising then, with bare and white uplifted faces stand, passing the host from hand to hand;  each takes, and then his visage wan is buried in his cowl once more. the cells!—the suffering son of man upon the wall—the knee-worn floor— and where they sleep, that wooden bed, which shall their coffin be, when dead!  the library, where tract and tome not to feed priestly pride are there, to hymn the conquering march of rome, nor yet to amuse, as ours are! they paint of souls the inner strife, their drops of blood, their death in life.  the garden, overgrown—yet mild, see, fragrant herbs are flowering there! strong children of the alpine wild whose culture is the brethren's care; of human tasks their only one, and cheerful works beneath the sun.  those halls, too, destined to contain each its own pilgrim-host of old, from england, germany, or spain— all are before me! i behold the house, the brotherhood austere! —and what am i, that i am here?  for rigorous teachers seized my youth, and purged its faith, and trimm'd its fire, show'd me the high, white star of truth, there bade me gaze, and there aspire. even now their whispers pierce the gloom: what dost thou in this living tomb?  forgive me, masters of the mind! at whose behest i long ago so much unlearnt, so much resign'd— i come not here to be your foe! i seek these anchorites, not in ruth, to curse and to deny your truth;  not as their friend, or child, i speak! but as, on some far northern strand, thinking of his own gods, a greek in pity and mournful awe might stand before some fallen runic stone— for both were faiths, and both are gone.  wandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born, with nowhere yet to rest my head, like these, on earth i wait forlorn. their faith, my tears, the world deride— i come to shed them at their side.  oh, hide me in your gloom profound, ye solemn seats of holy pain! take me, cowl'd forms, and fence me round, till i possess my soul again; till free my thoughts before me roll, not chafed by hourly false control!  for the world cries your faith is now but a dead time's exploded dream; my melancholy, sciolists say, is a pass'd mode, an outworn theme— as if the world had ever had a faith, or sciolists been sad!  ah, if it be pass'd, take away, at least, the restlessness, the pain; be man henceforth no more a prey to these out-dated stings again! the nobleness of grief is gone ah, leave us not the fret alone!  but—if you cannot give us ease— last of the race of them who grieve here leave us to die out with these last of the people who believe! silent, while years engrave the brow; silent—the best are silent now.  achilles ponders in his tent, the kings of modern thought are dumb, silent they are though not content, and wait to see the future come. they have the grief men had of yore, but they contend and cry no more.  our fathers water'd with their tears this sea of time whereon we sail, their voices were in all men's ears we pass'd within their puissant hail. still the same ocean round us raves, but we stand mute, and watch the waves.  for what avail'd it, all the noise and outcry of the former men?— say, have their sons achieved more joys, say, is life lighter now than then? the sufferers died, they left their pain— the pangs which tortured them remain.  what helps it now, that byron bore, with haughty scorn which mock'd the smart, through europe to the ætolian shore the pageant of his bleeding heart? that thousands counted every groan, and europe made his woe her own?  what boots it, shelley! that the breeze carried thy lovely wail away, musical through italian trees which fringe thy soft blue spezzian bay? inheritors of thy distress have restless hearts one throb the less?  or are we easier, to have read, o obermann! the sad, stern page, which tells us how thou hidd'st thy head from the fierce tempest of thine age in the lone brakes of fontainebleau, or chalets near the alpine snow?  ye slumber in your silent grave!— the world, which for an idle day grace to your mood of sadness gave, long since hath flung her weeds away. the eternal trifler breaks your spell; but we—we learned your lore too well!  years hence, perhaps, may dawn an age, more fortunate, alas! than we, which without hardness will be sage, and gay without frivolity. sons of the world, oh, speed those years; but, while we wait, allow our tears!  allow them! we admire with awe the exulting thunder of your race; you give the universe your law, you triumph over time and space! your pride of life, your tireless powers, we laud them, but they are not ours.  we are like children rear'd in shade beneath some old-world abbey wall, forgotten in a forest-glade, and secret from the eyes of all. deep, deep the greenwood round them waves, their abbey, and its close of graves!  but, where the road runs near the stream, oft through the trees they catch a glance of passing troops in the sun's beam— pennon, and plume, and flashing lance! forth to the world those soldiers fare, to life, to cities, and to war!  and through the wood, another way, faint bugle-notes from far are borne, where hunters gather, staghounds bay, round some fair forest-lodge at morn. gay dames are there, in sylvan green; laughter and cries—those notes between!  the banners flashing through the trees make their blood dance and chain their eyes; that bugle-music on the breeze arrests them with a charm'd surprise. banner by turns and bugle woo: ye shy recluses, follow too!  o children, what do ye reply?— "action and pleasure, will ye roam through these secluded dells to cry and call us?—but too late ye come! too late for us your call ye blow, whose bent was taken long ago.  "long since we pace this shadow'd nave; we watch those yellow tapers shine, emblems of hope over the grave, in the high altar's depth divine; the organ carries to our ear its accents of another sphere.  "fenced early in this cloistral round of reverie, of shade, of prayer, how should we grow in other ground? how can we flower in foreign air? —pass, banners, pass, and bugles, cease; and leave our desert to its peace!"

 there is far too much of the suburban classes spiritually not geographically speaking. they’re asses. menacing the greatness of our beloved england, they lie propagating their kind in an eightroomed stye. now i have a plan which i will enfold (there’s this to be said for them, they do as they’re told) then tell them their country’s in mortal peril they believed it before and again will not cavil put it in caption form firm and slick if they see it in print it is bound to stick: ‘your king and your country need you dead’ you see the idea? well, let it spread. have a suitable drug under string and label free for every registered reader’s table. for the rest of the gang who are not patriotic i’ve another appeal they’ll discover hypnotic: tell them it’s smart to be dead and won’t hurt and they’ll gobble up drug as they gobble up dirt.

 success is counted sweetest by those who ne'er succeed. to comprehend a nectar requires sorest need.  not one of all the purple host who took the flag today can tell the definition so clear of victory  as he defeated – dying – on whose forbidden ear the distant strains of triumph burst agonized and clear!

 ~~ &amp; thus you entered  a forest of solitudes  where in this great  sense your life had  been pursued, till like  a shadow breaking off  a rising body, a  need hovered &amp; grew.  some lined feature of  another fate strives to  be met, sits low  &amp; upright. those qualities  which had been energy  or grace past pain  wove from the nerves  a nest or instinct.  your calms are interesting.  write to us during  this terrible government. a  universe coughs blue &amp;  draws a twiceness from  the mitred now, while  your garden hand spells  the inexhaustible forms~~      for  elizabeth   robinson

 yes, the young mothers are beautiful, with all the self-acceptance of exhaustion, still dazed from their great outpouring, pushing their strollers along the public river walk.  
NEW POEM
 the bugle sounds the measured call to prayers, the band starts bravely with a clarion hymn, from every side, singly, in groups, in pairs, each to his kind of service comes to worship him.  our faces washed, our hearts in the right place, we kneel or stand or listen from our tents; half-naked natives with their kind of grace move down the road with balanced staffs like mendicants.  and over the hill the guns bang like a door and planes repeat their mission in the heights. the jungle outmaneuvers creeping war and crawls within the circle of our sacred rites.  i long for our disheveled sundays home, breakfast, the comics, news of latest crimes, talk without reference, and palindromes, sleep and the philharmonic and the ponderous times .  i long for lounging in the afternoons of clean intelligent warmth, my brother’s mind, books and thin plates and flowers and shining spoons, and your love’s presence, snowy, beautiful, and kind.  
NEW POEM
 her sense of smell is ten times stronger. and so her husband smells funny; she rolls away from him in the bed. she even smells funny to herself, but cannot roll away from that.  why couldn’t she get a more useful superpower? like the ability to turn invisible, or fly?  the refrigerator laughs at her from its dark corner, knowing she will have to open it some time and surrender to its villainous odors.

 drew down the curse of heaven on her umbrella furled and smelling of wet cigarettes, jo ran off in rain one pitchy night, one bloody a.m. found her staring, snoring.  “why do we all stay up so late?” jo queried. “though i don’t stay up so late as my friends.” she tripped the little bomb of wasps. they got her.  tears for jo, four, each perfect, waspish. a silver tongue and piss-blond hair decants a funeral oblation for the mouse. “she was a rare sight, a winning wonder. jo cultivates her toothaches elsewhere.”  
NEW POEM
 i think of the man who sat behind my grandmother’s sister in church and told her the percentage of indian in her blood, calling it out over the white pews. i wonder what made him want to count it like coins or a grade. i wish i could hear him now when i think of her saying that all the wampanoag blood in her body would fit in one finger, discounting the percentage it seemed, but why was she such a historian, tracing the genealogy of the last wampanoag up to her own children, typing it all on see-through paper? maybe like me she felt a little self-conscious caring about what we’re made of instead of simply being satisfied dressing our bodies and driving them around. maybe she felt shy for loving someone she’d never met, i mean i do. i think of the knife cutting into flesh and the fork carrying it

 1   she pressed her ear against the shell: she wanted to hear everything he never told her.   2   a single inch separates their two bodies facing one another in the picture: a framed smile buried beneath the rubble.    3   whenever you throw stones into the sea it sends ripples through me.    4   my heart’s quite small: that’s why it fills so quickly.    5   water needs no wars to mix with water and fill up spaces.    6   the tree doesn’t ask why it’s not moving to some other forest nor any other pointless questions.    7   he watches tv  while she holds a novel. on the novel’s cover there’s a man watching tv  and a woman holding a novel.    8   on the first morning of the new year all of us will look up at the same sun.    9   she raised his head to her chest. he did not respond: he was dead.    10   the person who gazed at me for so long, and whose gaze i returned for just as long . . . that man who never once embraced me, and whom i never once embraced  . . . the rain wrecked the colors around him on that old canvas.    11   he was not with the husbands who were lost and then found; he did not come with the prisoners of war, nor with the kite that took her, in her dream, to some other place, while she stood before the camera to have her smile glued into the passport.    12   dates piled high beside the road: your way of  kissing me.    13   rapunzel’s hair reaching down from the window to the earth is how we wait.    14   the shadows the prisoners left on the wall surrounded the jailer and cast light on his loneliness.    15   homeland, i am not your mother, so why do you weep in my lap like this every time something hurts you?    16   never mind this bird: it comes every day and stops at the branch’s edge to sing for an hour or two. that’s all it does: nothing makes it happier.    17   house keys, identity cards, faded pictures among the bones . . . all of these are scattered in a single mass grave.    18   the arabic language loves long sentences and long wars. it loves never-ending songs and late nights and weeping over ruins. it loves working for a long life and a long death.    19   far away from home — that’s all that changed in us.    20   cinderella left her slipper in iraq along with the smell of cardamom wafting from the teapot, and that huge flower, its mouth gaping like death.    21   instant messages ignite revolutions. they spark new lives waiting for a country to download, a land that’s little more than a handful of dust when faced with these words: “there are no results that match your search.”    22   the dog’s excitement as she brings the stick to her owner is the moment of opening the letter.    23   we cross borders lightly like clouds. nothing carries us, but as we move on we carry rain, and an accent, and a memory of another place.    24   how thrilling to appear in his eyes. she can’t understand what he’s saying: she’s too busy chewing his voice. she looks at the mouth she’ll never kiss, at the shoulder she’ll never cry on, at the hand she’ll never hold, and at the ground where their shadows meet.

 i come from inuit oil money, from instruments of chance and divination. the most loose, shut in, wavering mind, recording my day with recitations, antennae, narration and figure, my phone might die. i'm walking dirty. shop and mob cops, not to touch my mother's breast or the queen's royal crown signature izzy juju—hijacked, forsaking all others. the untamed scotch is mine. it cost the picture a fortune to say nothing of my turban, costume copies of topaz bracelets, the umpteenth translation. did you ever know micah, gay sunshine, grace cathedral, coconut? i went from heels at barneys to the depths of the bins. who could be like dropping in? i'll fold both my hands in gloves and wait, hope diamond peeking out.

 i will not tend. or water, pull, or yank, i will not till, uproot,  fill up or spray.  the rain comes. or not. plants: sun-fed, moon-hopped, dirt-stuck.  watch as flocks of wild phlox  appear, disappear. my lazy, garbagey magic makes this nothing happen.  i love the tattered camisole of nothing. the world runs its underbrush course fed by the nothing i give it.  wars are fought. blood turns. dirt is a wide unruly room.  
NEW POEM
 as usual, the first gate was modest. it is dilapidated. she can’t tell which bridge crossed the moat, which all cross sand now, disordered with footsteps. it’s a precise overlay of circles on squares, but she has trouble locating the main avenue and retraces her steps in intense heat for the correct entrance, which was intentionally blurred, the  way a round arch can give onto a red wall, far enough in back of the arch for sun to light.  if being by yourself separates from your symmetry, which is the axis of your spine in the concrete sense, but becomes a suspension in your spine like a layer of sand under the paving stones of a courtyard or on a plain, you have to humbly seek out a person who can listen to you, on a street crowded with bicycles at night, their bells ringing.  and any stick or straight line you hold can be your spine, like a map she is following in french of tan tien. she wants space to fall to each side of her like traction, not weight dispersed within a mirror. at any time, an echo of what she says will multiply against the walls in balanced, dizzying jumps like a gyroscope in the heat, but she is alone.  later, she would remember herself as a carved figure and its shadow on a blank board, but she is her balancing stick, and the ground to each side of her is its length, disordered once by an armored car, and once by an urn of flowers at a crossing. the stick isn’t really the temple’s bisection around her, like solstice or ancestor. this tang dynasty peach tree would be parallel levitation in the spine the person recording it.  slowly the hall looms up. the red stair’s outline gives way to its duration as it extends and rises at a low angle. in comparison to the family, the individual hardly counts, but they all wait for her at a teahouse inside the wall. first the gold knob, then blue tiers above the highest step, the same color as the sky.  when one person came to gain confidence, she imagines he felt symmetry as flight after his fast among seven meteorites in the dark. he really felt like a globe revolving within a globe. even the most singular or indivisible particle or heavenly sphere will adjust when the axis extending beyond itself is pushed, or the sphere it is within is pushed. what she thought was her balance flattens into a stylized dragon on the marble paving stones.  yet she’s reluctant to leave the compound. only the emperor could walk its center line. now, anyone can imagine how it felt to bring heaven news. she is trying to remember this in hong kong as the tram pulls suddenly above skyscrapers and the harbor and she flattens against her seat, like a reversal occurring in the poles, or what she meant by, no one can imagine how.

 after  jean-michel basquiat crows and more crows. one crow with a rat hanging from its beak, sloppy and beautiful. another crow with its wings plucked empty. i wanted so much of today to be peaceful but the empty crow untethers something in me: a feral yearning for love or a love that is so full of  power, of  tenderness, the words fall to their knees begging for mercy like tulips in wind. i don’t wear the crown for the times power has tainted my body, but i can tell the difference between giving up and giving in. if  you can’t, ask the crow that watches me through the window, laughing as i drink my third bottle of wine. ask the sound the tree makes when the crow has grown disgusted with my whining. after years of repression, i can come clean. i was a boy with a hole other boys stuffed themselves into. i have wanted nothing to do with blackness or laughter or my life. but about love, who owns the right, really? who owns the crow who loves fresh meat or the crow who loves the vibration of its own throat? everything around me is black for its own good, i suppose. the widow, the picture of the boy crying on the wall, the mirror with its taunting, the crows that belong to their scripture. can you imagine being so tied to blackness that even your wings cannot help you escape? about my life, every needle, a small prayer. every pill, a funeral hymn. i wanted the end several times but thought, who owns this body, really? god? dirt? the silly insects that will feast on my decay? is it the boy who entered first or the boy who wanted everything to last?

 in the desert, the moon  shivers. tonight, to stay awake, i’ll cut my feet  with glass. outside oaxaca, in a clinic, my mother said,  “i hate your indian face.” in the dream i’m running. my limbs skeletal  and scabbed. after my mother’s death, i found, in a box,  her wedding dress. as i lifted the lid, a stench corkscrewed  into my nostrils: the dress had curdled like milk. during the day  i gather tinder. paper. shed snakeskin. when the last light  above the mountains knots into stars, i crouch under mesquite,  make a fire.  sometimes the moon stops shivering. sometimes  i tally what i owe. in the dream i’m running through a hallway.  the floor uneven. the walls green. last month, as my son blew out  the candles on his cake, i noticed, for the first time,  the hideous shape of his nose. tonight i’ll pinch my thighs to stay  awake. my mother, in the clinic, said, “the rain has a fever, it  needs plenty of rest, it needs to drink plenty of water.” the doctor  scribbled in a file then asked for more money. if my mother  could see me now! my feet bloody. my face darker than ever.  tonight, to stay awake, i’ll sit close to the fire. in the dream i stumble,  but i never let go of my right breast: an urn heavy with my own  ashes, an urn i’m lugging god-knows-where.

 “your great-grandfather was . . .”  and mrs. c, our tart old scots landlady, with her stomping legs, four bristles sprouted from her chin- wart, she who briskly chats away about montrose, founder of her clan, as though she’s just now fresh from tea with him, regards you incredulously, a bastard gargoyle off some bastard architecture, one grown topsy-turvy: “not to know your great-grandfather! how do you live? o you americans!” she cannot see what freedom it affords, your ignorance, a space swept clear of all the clutter of lives lived. and yet who can dismiss her words entirely? it burdens too, this emptiness, pervasive presence not a room away that, no matter how you hammer at its wall, refuses to admit you. as though you woke and in a place you thought familiar, then had a sense (what is it that has been disturbed?) of one you never met yet somehow knew—looks echoing among the dusty pictures: that myopic glass reflecting, like a sunset lingered inside trees, a meditative smile: a breath warm to your cheek, your brow: the hand (whose?) moving on your blanket in a gesture that you fail to recognize  yet know it as you know the taste through oranges of sun- light current in them still—  then gone as you began to stir. and for a moment dawn seems lost as in a mist, seems wistful  for a feeling it cannot achieve . . . the sun breaks through, an instant medleying the leaves.

 this, we tiptoe. this, we flower in euphemism. the street has swallowed itself into border. into railroad track. this, where the bus line ends. this, where little boys bike across curfew and into eulogy. this, where board-slapped windows domino into mansions. runaway men into joggers. this, where oak park river forest alumni rep westside, redlands east valley minstrels “gangsta day” during spirit week. this, where the grass and the quiet lull mothers to sleep. this, where your heart is not yet a restless telephone wire shackled to the ankle of every one you have ever loved after sunset. this, where the news stations tell you everything you know about what lives across your street, outside of your living room window, at the end of your driveway. this, deliberate. this, abrupt. this, sloppy stitching.  here, you are exception, urban, and articulate. the black friend that let them poke pencils through your kink that one time while you curled a trembling smile, pretending not to be token or voodoo doll, half house, half field a susie carmichael or huxtable. the black family in a white house ran north and bought the plantation.  this all too familiar of being someplace but not. you were raised on “twice as good.” mama left the westside when you were two. you were raised into valley-girl accent. your voice lost all of its skyline until you went to high school through metal detectors. you were raised on ditches and division streets. here, where you were born before you were conceived.  here, where your cousin lives in the basement. here is your first real boyfriend the first tongue in your mouth, and first call from the county. here is the splintered wall your back will know. here, where you are no bourgeois success story, just lucky enough to slip through cracks and make it to your front door each night. here is where your ashes will be scattered. here is your home 6 years from now. here is your home 50 years ago. here is your redemption skin. your corner store. your corner stone. here is your gramma’s house and dusted porcelain and stuffed bears on the living room walls. here, where everything grows without permission. here, where sunflowers rise from the potholes  each and every summer.

 there, robert, you have kill'd that fly — , and should you thousand ages try the life you've taken to supply, you could not do it.  you surely must have been devoid of thought and sense, to have destroy'd a thing which no way you annoy'd — you'll one day rue it.  twas but a fly perhaps you'll say, that's born in april, dies in may; that does but just learn to display his wings one minute,  and in the next is vanish'd quite. a bird devours it in his flight — or come a cold blast in the night, there's no breath in it.  the bird but seeks his proper food — and providence, whose power endu'd that fly with life, when it thinks good, may justly take it.  but you have no excuses for't — a life by nature made so short, less reason is that you for sport should shorter make it.  a fly a little thing you rate — but, robert do not estimate a creature's pain by small or great; the greatest being  can have but fibres, nerves, and flesh, and these the smallest ones possess, although their frame and structure less escape our seeing.

 the poet’s duties: no need to stress the subject’s dullness, nonetheless here’s an incestuous address in robert burns’ style to one whom all the muses bless at great turnstile.  i’ve no excuses for this theme. prescription is less popular than dream and little rhymes, god knows, can seem much too laconic, bollinger’s visionary gleam turned gin-and-tonic.  but ssch! you know and understand the way these verses have been planned: gritty like little bits of sand not shining quartz; no pulsing from a higher gland just random thoughts.  let’s start by thinking of objectives. poets hate to have directives: they’re on their own, not on collectives, share and share about, and what inspires their best invectives is what they care about.  you,james, collapsed upon our sofa as though being driven by a chauffeur, won’t fail to tell us what you go for: managerial boobs and answers that you won’t take no for from fine tubes.  reporters never throw in towels. their prose is written from the bowels. ottava rima about owls printed by sycamore is worlds away from enoch powell’s plans for the blackamoor.  but are you james cameron or flecker? are you a maker or a trekker? what is the nature of your mecca, your verum pulchrum? i’m glad, of course, that you’re with secker and not with fulcrum.  poet and traveller have quarrelled and now you canter where you carolled. we’re waiting still for your childe harold, though quests in poland find you fixated and apparelled more like childe roland.  it is impressive, i agree, although i know it’s not for me. i take the windfalls from the tree, i’m much too lazy, the prisons that i want to see by piranesi.  you say that oxford has no marrow, sucked dry by trevor-roper, sparrow, and others of reaction’s farrow in their fat cloister, though if my eye is just as narrow it may be moister.  we never see our feelings through, and weeping only makes us blue. it may be beautiful and true but it’s not action, and nothing the bourgeoisie can do gives satisfaction.  how can we alter our behaviour? should we deny our gravy’s gravier? leave cleopatra for octavia? my life is inner, and someone i don’t think a saviour is b. f. skinner.  avoid that fashionable flock: to be refitted in their dock your common-sense must take a knock as it took a course on the reflexes of frogs, and locke, and p. f. strawson.  much of the left we can ignore (sheer anarchy i don’t adore). the trendy educate the poor in greed and fear, while labour’s entered on the war of jenkins’ ear.  no. righteous more than he who hath, more reasonable than new math, momier than the mome rath in their outgrabing, glossing the variorum plath from krafft-ebing,  apostles of determinism whose hero’s mao or virgil grissom won’t interest your mind one rissom: you’re too empirical. what about neo-imagism? impossibly lyrical.  such knowing brevity needs patience: as unfastidious croatians upon quite intimate occasions shun body-talc, so leave your interpersonal relations to colin falck.  for poetry to have some merit he requires it to display sincerity, each pronoun to convince posterity with deep emotion and an invigorating verity like hair-lotion.  well, that’s unfair. i’m glad he lives. just think of the alternatives! those whose verse resembles sieves or a diagram, and foul-mouthed transatlantic spivs wooing trigram.  for they are all still with us,james, fiddling among the flames, brandishing the brittle fames they soon arrive at. it’s better not to mention names: they’ll wince in private.  orating offspring of urania (no fault of yours that they’re not brainier) have an immodest dogged mania for autobiography disguised in concrete or the zanier forms of typography.  the wide-eyed audience they’re rooking would secretly prefer a booking from a quartet like the backward-looking rank ailanthus they’d jump to hear what’s really cooking with the black panthers.  whatever props the poet uses, whether he accepts, accuses or gives up, he must know his muse is a sensible girl. even some antics of ted hughes’s make her hair curl.  and so you need a form to play about in but which will convey something of what you want to say without evasion, adjusting like the vicar of bray to each occasion.  the size you haven’t found as yet. what nabokov calls the ‘triolet’ is much too trim a maisonette to dawdle in, unlike your shabby cloisters set in magdalen,  which made your poetry much dandier, much like ottava rima, handier. you needed in its chilly grandeur to turn the fire on for times when you felt even randier than lord byron.  still, you found sonnets quite inspiring although some rhymes like ancient wiring showed the circuits could prove tiring (though not unduly, and no one could be more admiring than yours truly).  so carry on: your talents hum. no one will ever find you dumb while you avoid the slightly rum like the white goddess or black mountain(and don’t become roger woddis).  i’ll send a sub to the is (please let me know the right address) i shan’t turn up, but i confess i’m not a traitor. i just don’t want to think the less of teresa hayter.  some day i’ll join you in the street where suffering and truth must meet: it isn’t easy not to feel effete this side of anguish, when those who can’t choose what to eat don’t speak our language.  meanwhile we have to try to bring some order to that circus ring where people think and feel and sing, for at its centre there’s no escape from anything, and we must enter.

 at first you'll joy to see the playful snow, like white moths trembling on the tropic air, or waters of the hills that softly flow gracefully falling down a shining stair.  and when the fields and streets are covered white and the wind-worried void is chilly, raw, or underneath a spell of heat and light the cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,  like me you'll long for home, where birds' glad song means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry, and tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong, beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.  but oh! more than the changeless southern isles, when spring has shed upon the earth her charm, you'll love the northland wreathed in golden smiles by the miraculous sun turned glad and warm.

 to one who has been long in city pent, 'tis very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer full in the smile of the blue firmament. who is more happy, when, with heart's content, fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair of wavy grass, and reads a debonair and gentle tale of love and languishment? returning home at evening, with an ear catching the notes of philomel,—an eye watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, he mourns that day so soon has glided by: e'en like the passage of an angel's tear that falls through the clear ether silently.  
NEW POEM
 child of distress, who meet’st the bitter scorn of fellow-men to happier prospects born, doomed art and nature’s various stores to see flow in full cups of joy—and not for thee; who seest the rich, to heaven and fate resigned, bear thy afflictions with a patient mind; whose bursting heart disdains unjust control, who feel’st oppression’s iron in thy soul, who dragg’st the load of faint and feeble years, whose bread is anguish, and whose water tears; bear, bear thy wrongs—fulfill thy destined hour, bend thy meek neck beneath the foot of power; but when thou feel’st the great deliverer nigh, and thy freed spirit mounting seeks the sky, let no vain fears thy parting hour molest, no whispered terrors shake thy quiet breast: think not their threats can work thy future woe, nor deem the lord above like lords below;— safe in the bosom of that love repose by whom the sun gives light, the ocean flows; prepare to meet a father undismayed, nor fear the god whom priests and kings have made.

 are you content, you pretty three-years’ wife? are you content and satisfied to live on what your loving husband loves to give, and give to him your life?  are you content with work, — to toil alone, to clean things dirty and to soil things clean; to be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, — queen of a cook-stove throne?  are you content to reign in that small space -- a wooden palace and a yard-fenced land -- with other queens abundant on each hand, each fastened in her place?  are you content to rear your children so? untaught yourself, untrained, perplexed, distressed, are you so sure your way is always best? that you can always know?  have you forgotten how you used to long in days of ardent girlhood, to be great, to help the groaning world, to serve the state, to be so wise — so strong?  and are you quite convinced this is the way, the only way a woman’s duty lies -- knowing all women so have shut their eyes? seeing the world to-day?  having no dream of life in fuller store? of growing to be more than that you are? doing the things you know do better far, yet doing others - more?  losing no love, but finding as you grew that as you entered upon nobler life you so became a richer, sweeter wife, a wiser mother too?  what holds you? ah, my dear, it is your throne, your paltry queenship in that narrow place, your antique labours, your restricted space, your working all alone!  be not deceived! ‘tis not your wifely bond that holds you, nor the mother’s royal power, but selfish, slavish service hour by hour -- a life with no beyond!

 roman virgil, thou that singest ilion's lofty temples robed in fire, ilion falling, rome arising, wars, and filial faith, and dido's pyre;  landscape-lover, lord of language more than he that sang the "works and days," all the chosen coin of fancy flashing out from many a golden phrase;  thou that singest wheat and woodland, tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd; all the charm of all the muses often flowering in a lonely word;  poet of the happy tityrus piping underneath his beechen bowers; poet of the poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;  chanter of the pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be, summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth and oarless sea;  thou that seëst universal nature moved by universal mind; thou majestic in thy sadness at the doubtful doom of human kind;  light among the vanish'd ages; star that gildest yet this phantom shore; golden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to rise no more;  now thy forum roars no longer, fallen every purple cæsar's dome— tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm sound forever of imperial rome—  now the rome of slaves hath perish'd, and the rome of freemen holds her place, i, from out the northern island sunder'd once from all the human race,  i salute thee, mantovano, i that loved thee since my day began, wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.

 today a celebrity chimpanzee went postal, tearing up a woman’s face in connecticut. and as the taliban were given the suburbs of swat in which to stone to death women taken in adultery, a muslim in new york whose radio station promoted islam as the most humane religion cut off his wife’s head. tomorrow, of course, will be another day, but we live one day at a time. yesterday i uncovered the ribbon snake in the woodpile, stiff and cold in its winter sleep. a new urgency for spring: i put the split log back and took my wood from the farther end of the last stack.  what’s with the chimp? i wondered, driving between filthy snowbanks past stark trees like bony hands clawing up out of the frozen earth to grab a gray heaven. my wife thinks it’s all that wireless buzz hissing unbeknownst through everyone’s brains. i lean more toward toilet training.  for sure, it began to go bad one unknown day before history when the last man was browbeaten to step beyond a globe of golden firelight to drain his dragon in outer darkness. but we can’t dwell in the past, can we? “to spring out on” we call hereabouts the firewood we wade through crusted snow to cut in march. someone just might have to wake up early this year. but, then, let’s just try to stay in the day, shall we?

 a slow news day, but i did like the obit about the butcher who kept the same store for fifty years.   people remembered when his street was sweetly roaring, aproned with flower stalls and fish stands. the stock market wandered, spooked by presidential winks, by micro-winds and the shadows of earnings.   news was stationed around the horizon, ready as summer clouds to thunder-- but it moved off and we covered the committee meeting at the back of the statehouse, sat around on our desks, then went home early.   the birds were still singing, the sun just going down.   working these long hours, you forget how beautiful the early evening can be, the big houses like ships turning into the night, their rooms piled high with silence.

 “ the art of our necessities is strange, that can make vile things precious.” a mile out in the marshes, under a sky which seems to be always going away in a hurry, on that venetian land threaded with hidden canals, you will find the city which seconds ours (so cemeteries, too, reflect a town from hillsides out of town), where being most becomingly ends up becoming some more. from cardboard tenements, windowed with cellophane, or simply tenting in paper bags, the angry mackerel eyes glare at you out of stove-in, sunken heads far from the sea; the lobster, also, lifts an empty claw in his most minatory of gestures; oyster, crab, and mussel shells lie here in heaps, savage as money hurled away at the gate of hell. if you want results, these are results. objects of value or virtue, however, are also to be picked up here, though rarely, lying with bones and rotten meat, eggshells and mouldy bread, banana peels no one will skid on, apple cores that caused neither the fall of man nor a theory of gravitation. people do throw out the family pearls by accident, sometimes, not often; i’ve known dealers in antiques to prowl this place by night, with flashlights, on the off-chance of somebody’s having left derelict chairs which will turn out to be by hepplewhite, a perfect set of six going to show, i guess, that in any sty someone’s heaven may open and shower down riches responsive to the right dream; though it is a small chance, certainly, that sends the ghostly dealer, heavy with fly-netting over his head, across these hills in darkness, stumbling in cut-glass goblets, lacquered cups, and other products of his dreamy midden penciled with light and guarded by the flies.  for there are flies, of course. a dynamo composed, by thousands, of our ancient black retainers, hums here day and night, steady as someone telling beads, the hum becoming a high whine at any disturbance; then, settled again, they shine under the sun like oil-drops, or are invisible as night, by night. all this continually smoulders, crackles, and smokes with mostly invisible fires which, working deep, rarely flash out and flare, and never finish. nothing finishes; the flies, feeling the heat, keep on the move.  among the flies, the purefying fires, the hunters by night, acquainted with the art of our necessities, and the new deposits that each day wastes with treasure, you may say there should be ratios. you may sum up the results, if you want results. but i will add that wild birds, drawn to the carrion and flies, assemble in some numbers here, their wings shining with light, their flight enviably free, their music marvelous, though sad, and strange.  
NEW POEM
 where moonlight angles through the east-west streets, down among the old for america tall buildings that changed the streets of other cities circulate elevated trains overhead shrieking and drumming, lit by explosions of sparks that harm no one and the shadowed persons walking underneath the erratic waves not of the lake but of noise move through fog sieved by the steel mesh of the supporting structures or through rain that rinses pavements and the el platforms or through new snow that quiets corners, moods, riveted careers. working for others with hands, backs, machines, men built hard towers that part the high air, women and men built, cooked, cleaned, delivered, typed and filed, carried and delivered, priced and sold. the river and air were filthy. in a hundred years builders would migrate north a mile but in these modern times this was all the downtown that was. and circling on a round-cornered rectangle of tracks run the trains, clockwise and counter, veering through or loop-the-loop and out again. why even try to list the kinds of places men and women made to make money? not enough of them, yet too many. from slow trains overhead some passengers can still see stone ornaments, pilasters, lintels, carved by grandfathers, great uncles and gone second cousins of today—gargoyle heads and curving leaves, like memorials for that which was built to be torn down again someday, for those who got good wages out of all this building or were broken by it, or both, yet whose labor preserves a record of labor, imagination, ambition, skill, greed, folly, error, cost, story, so that a time before remains present within the bright careening now.

 the professor stabbed his chest with his hands curled like forks before coughing up the question that had dogged him since he first read emerson: why am i “i”? like musk oxen we hunkered while his lecture drifted against us like snow. if we could, we would have turned our backs into the wind.  i felt bad about his class’s being such a snoozefest, though peaceful too, a quiet little interlude from everyone outside rooting up the corpse of literature for being too caucasian. there was a simple answer to my own question (how come no one loved me, stomping on the pedals of my little bicycle):  i was insufferable. so, too, was emerson i bet, though i liked if the red slayer think he slays— the professor drew a giant eyeball to depict the over-soul. then he read a chapter from his own book: naptime. he didn’t care if our heads tipped forward on their stalks.  when spring came, he even threw us a picnic in his yard where dogwood bloomed despite a few last dirty bergs of snow. he was a wounded animal being chased across the tundra by those wolves, the postmodernists. at any moment you expected to see blood come dripping through his clothes.  and i am i who never understood his question, though he let me climb to take a seat aboard the wooden scow he’d been building in the shade of thirty-odd years. how i ever rowed it from his yard, into my life—remains a mystery. the work is hard because the eyeball’s heavy, riding in the bow.

 on the porch, unbreeched shotgun dangling across one arm, just after the killing, the murderer, billy winkles, made polite small talk with my father while we waited for the sheriff to come. the reek of cordite still loomed above the sheeted corpse, his uncle ben, whose various dark and viscous organs jeweled the lawn. “want some coffee, von?” i heard, and thought, a man is dead. and then: why had my father brought me there to stand alone, out of place, half-terrified, bored with the slow yammer of weather and crops?  i stepped carefully across the rotted planks toward an oak where an engine block depended from a blackened limb and watched a dull dazzle of horseflies, a few puddles hounds had dug like chocolate ruffles hemming the chicken yard. “i told the son of a bitch, come back, i’ll shoot you dead,” and he sure had, for sniffing round his wife. he said, “it just ain’t right.” he rolled a smoke and dragged a steady flame alive while neighbors shyly stomped from pickups and lifted the sheet to poke and peek.  “that’s ben,” one said. “that’s ben to a t.” but was it? was any of it real, the empty house, the creek? my father saying, “now your mother, she was a partain, wasn’t she?” “naw, she was a winkles, too. my wife was a partain, she’s over at mai-maw’s now.” it went like that, and this. the wind drove up and set the shirts to popping on the line. a red tricycle leaned above a one-eyed doll.  the mountain’s blue escarpment unwound green bolts of fields, the white shelters where we lived, all of it somehow wrong, and magical not to have changed while trucks backed up along the ditch and men with their grown boys clambered uphill to gawk at uncle ben who lay like shortcakes lined up on sawhorses on decoration days.  how strange, i thought, that no one prayed, and strange that i was there, actually there, with grown men, not sad or happy, but proud, knowing even then, the years would mostly amount to sleep, my father would come back as history, and still there would be to say the strobe of the ambulance light; the sheriff, a tall, portly man, stooping to help the handcuffed killer into the car; and on the grass, bits of liver or spleen— whatever i’d dream, the world is not a lie.

that’s what it means to go on a trip that’s what it means to leave the place where you live trips and then more trips there are things you need to carry with you to survive not knowing what else to do, i called my husband, filed for divorce, talked to my children and told them mommy wouldn’t be home for a while, in other words, it was only after i abandoned my relationships, my attachments, and even my language that i was light enough to get on the plane, when i arrived, all i had was a few changes of clothes, some cash, my passport, my visa waiver, my credit cards, and an  international driver’s license in california, the sky was blue, there was nothing but seashore, wild land, and housing developments, it was hazy and hard to see in the evenings, it was as if everything was immersed in mother’s milk, my toes got cold, i bought some socks, but after wearing them three days, the cheap things were ready to fall apart, i looked long and hard at them, feeling like a coyote (yeah, i tell people i came alone but that is not entirely true i was always thinking about the coyote the two of us traveling together) i saw dead raccoons i saw dead skunks i smelled them too someone i met the first day said to me the whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhere it was an unfamiliar scent, but now i know it well the whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhere i know to say that to people now in any case, i didn’t see any coyotes (two traveling together) someone in the street told me to get the hell out of here why had i come? i couldn’t find what i wanted, i had come so far but,get the hell out, this isn’t the place where the coyotes are, they’re farther away, in deeper places, where there is nothing, where there is much more emptiness so i headed east from the western edge of the continent to the east the interstates with odd numbers run north and south while even numbers run east and west those in the 500s are the bypasses for i-5 (north-south) those in the 800s are the bypasses for i-8 (east-west) i took i-5 south to i-580 i went further south to i-8 then went east east, east, east and even further east in arizona, i took i-17 at flagstaff, i took us route 89 i dashed into a roadside motel, slept, and woke and started driving again the morning light shone brilliantly each time i stopped to fill up with gas, i bought some brownies, each individually wrapped, i tore off the wrappers with one hand and ate them as i drove, the ridiculously sweet lumps stuck to the roof  of my mouth, when i stopped in front of a motel that night, my fingers didn’t want to leave the steering wheel, at the registration desk, the words i needed to say in english didn’t rise to my lips, even though  i knew them all too well (two traveling together) there was a woman standing at the side of the road, i called out to her in broken english, asking her what was the matter, she answered in what was also broken english would you mind taking me to the nearest gas station? she sat in the passenger’s seat i’m navajo where are you from? from california, i answered no, that’s not what i meant what tribe are you from? she asked (two traveling together) from kayenta i took us route 163 toward monument valley i had heard that coyotes lived there long ago that it’s an amazing place, the moon rises, the sun sets i imagined it would be like seeing the ocean but when i got there, it wasn’t like the ocean at all rocks soared into the air rocks, rocks, even more rocks red rocks in the dust i watched the sun set over them by the time i got back to route 163, the sun had sunk deep beyond the horizon, the only thing i could see was the road in front of me,  i drove on looking for a place to sleep, but i didn’t see a thing, there wasn’t anything to see, air rushed through my cracked window,  letting out a long, thin, high-pitched whistle hii-iuu-uuuuu hii-iuu-uuuuu like a reed flute my thin, hard window was slightly open, the wind rushed in but couldn’t escape hii-iuuu uuu-uuuuu uuu-hiiuuuuu (two of us heard it) i drove a long way before spying a large motel, i saw the vacancy sign as i approached, i thought i’d have to drive for hours and hours before finding a place to sleep, i thought i wouldn’t stop, that i’d drive all night without stopping, but the place i found was part of a chain you see in every city, the bed was big and deep, and there was lots of hot water in the tub (two of us were there) the next morning the car was completely filthy the whole thing was covered with bright red dirt and sand the windshield was covered with the splattered bodies of countless insects no one knew i had slept there, nor that i was leaving, nor which direction i was headed, no one knew it was a day that invited death along the roadside i hadn’t even driven for five minutes before i saw it — a single, dead coyote lying on its back, legs in the air (it was both me and my travel companion, too) translated from the  japanese

 of the sleeves, i remember their weight, like wet wool, on my arms, and the empty ends which hung past my hands. of the body of the shirt, i remember the large buttons and larger buttonholes, which made a rack of wheels down my chest and could not be quickly unbuttoned. of the collar, i remember its thickness without starch, by which it lay against my clavicle without moving. of my trousers, the same—heavy, bulky, slow to give for a leg, a crowded feeling, a molasses to walk in. of my boots, i remember the brittle soles, of a material that had not been made love to by any natural substance, and the laces: ropes to make prisoners of my feet. of the helmet, i remember the webbed, inner liner, a brittle plastic underwear on which wobbled the crushing steel pot then strapped at the chin. of the mortar, i remember the mortar plate, heavy enough to kill by weight, which i carried by rope. of the machine gun, i remember the way it fit behind my head and across my shoulder blades as i carried it, or, to be precise, as it rode me. of tactics, i remember the likelihood of shooting the wrong man, the weight of the rifle bolt, the difficulty of loading while prone, the shock of noise. for earplugs, some used cigarette filters or toilet paper. i don’t hear well now, for a man of my age, and the doctor says my ears were damaged and asks if i was in the army, and of course i was but then a wounded eardrum wasn’t much in the scheme.

 of mina-sarpilili-anda ii, the only surviving record is this splendid bas-relief in which he presses the neck of his hittite foe beneath one battle-shod foot while minions shoulder the spoils of a conquered city.  in fact there was no war that year; a bored stone-carver was looking for preferment. he received an allowance of good wine. in a perfumed cloud of dust that loitered over the plain, hittite ambassadors came to the king with golden bells and rosewater candy, birds in cages and spotted cats, and departed in peace. the king was beloved, laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed of poison.  a carnelian image of his second-best wife, accurate to the last mole, was plucked from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, on a ship that sank on a cloudless day. an image of his first wife, in chrysoprase, lies tightly packed in buried rubble for the next generation of archaeologists— should they prove worthy, persistent, and slyer than goatherds.  
NEW POEM
 i think first of two sparrows i met when walking home, late night years ago, in another city, not unlike this — the one  bird frantic, attacking i thought, the way she swooped down, circled my head, and flailed her wings in my face;  how she seemed to scream each time i swung; how she dashed back and forth between me and a blood-red corolla  parked near the opposite curb; how, finally, i understood: i spied another bird, also calling, its foot inexplicably  caught in the car’s closed door, beating its whole bird body against it. trying, it appeared, to bang himself free.  and who knows how long he’d been there, wailing. who knows — he and the other i mistook, at first, for a bat.  they called to me — something between squawk and chirp, something between song and prayer — to do something,  anything. and, like any good god, i disappeared. not indifferent, exactly. but with things to do. and, most likely,  on my way home from another heartbreak. call it 1997, and say i’m several thousand miles from home. by which  i mean those were the days i made of everyone a love song. by which i mean i was lonely and unrequited. but that’s  not quite it either. truth is, i did manage to find a few to love me, but couldn’t always love them back. the rasta  law professor. the firefighter’s wife. the burlesque dancer whose daughter blackened drawings with m s to mean  the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died. i think his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip.  anyway, i’m digressing. but if you asked that night — did i mention it was night? — why i didn’t even try  to jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow, i couldn’t say, truthfully, that it had anything to do with envy, with wanting  a woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did, one for the other. no. i’d have said something, instead,  about the neighborhood itself, the car thief shot a block and a half east the week before. or about the men  i came across nights prior, sweat-slicked and shirtless, grappling in the middle of the street, the larger one’s chest  pressed to the back of the smaller, bruised and bleeding both. i know you thought this was about birds,  but stay with me. i left them both in the street — the same street where i’d leave the sparrows — the men  embracing and, for all one knows (especially one not from around there), they could have been lovers —  the one whispering an old, old tune into the ear of the other —baby, baby, don’t leave me this way. i left  the men where i’d leave the sparrows and their song. and as i walked away, i heard one of the men call to me,  please or help or brother or some such. and i didn’t break stride, not one bit. it’s how i’ve learned to save myself.  let me try this another way. call it 1977. and say i’m back west, south central los angeles. my mother  and father at it again. but this time in the street, broad daylight, and all the neighbors watching. one,  i think his name was sonny, runs out from his duplex to pull my father off. you see where i’m going with this?  my mother crying out, fragile as a sparrow. sonny fighting my father, fragile as a sparrow. and me,  years later, trying to get it all down. as much for you — i’m saying — as for me. sonny catches a left, lies flat  on his back, blood starting to pool and his own wife wailing. my mother wailing, and traffic backed,  now, half a block. horns, whistles, and soon sirens. 1977. summer. and all the trees full of birds. hundreds,  i swear. and since i’m the one writing it, i’ll tell you they were crying. which brings me back to dolphy  and his transcribing. the jazzman, i think, wanted only to get it down pure. to get it down exact — the animal  racking itself against a car’s steel door, the animals in the trees reporting, the animals we make of ourselves  and one another. stay with me now. don’t leave me. days after the dustup, my parents took me to the park.  and in this park was a pond, and in this pond were birds. not sparrows, but swans. and my father spread a blanket  and brought from a basket some apples and a paring knife. summertime. my mother wore sunglasses. and long sleeves.  my father, now sober, cursed himself for leaving the radio. but my mother forgave him, and said, as she caressed  the back of his hand, that we could just listen to the swans. and we listened. and i watched. two birds coupling,  one beating its wings as it mounted the other. summer, 1977. i listened. and watched. when my parents made love  late into that night, i covered my ears in the next room, scanning the encyclopedia for swans. it meant nothing to me —  then, at least — but did you know the collective noun for swans is a lamentation? and is a lamentation not  its own species of song? what a woman wails, punch drunk in the street? or what a widow might sing, learning her man  was drowned by swans? a lamentation of them? imagine the capsized boat, the panicked man, struck about the eyes,  nose, and mouth each time he comes up for air. imagine the birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm.  either trumpet swans or mutes. the dead man’s wife running for help, crying to any who’d listen. a lamentation.  and a city busy saving itself. i’m digressing, sure. but did you know that to digress means to stray from the flock?  when i left my parents’ house, i never looked back. by which i mean i made like a god and disappeared. as when i left  the sparrows. and the copulating swans. as when someday i’ll leave this city. its every flailing, its every animal song.

 for mark strand la barraca blues suite/i.  beneath canopies of green, unionists marched doggedly outside the embassy. their din was no match for light lancing through leaves of madrone trees lining the paseo then flashing off glossy black maybachs skidding round a plaza like a monarch fleeing the paparazzi. your voice skipped and paused like a pencil. layers of morning pastries flaked gingerly then fell, soft as vowels, on a china plate. one learns to cherish the wizened reserve of old world manners, two blotched hands making wings of a daily paper beside us between sips of café con leche, a demeanor in short gentle as grand edifaces along this boulevard. yet guernica is down the street, and some windshields wear a sinister face, sometimes two. think goya. just south of here, on the lower slopes of the sierras, fields of olive groves braid the land like a moorish head, but those sultans were kicked out long ago. in the lobby of the hotel urban, i wait for a cab, my obedient rolling bag like a pet beside me. i have loved again another city but madrid is yours: her caped olés, her bullish flag, her glass pavilions and outdoor tables like a festival of unbroken laughter, our dark harbors, finding level.  ii. salobreña  that stretch of mountains features white windmill blades whose slow turns are rifles aiming, for i cannot help but think of lorca's killing between here and the village alfaçar, and the firing squad's gun pops are that flamencan dancer's heel stomps. i bring back, too, her brisk hand claps and the cantor's andalusian moans like dried sticks, or bones crumbling in his throat. only souvenir shops and steep winding streets accrete in this region's stacked brochures.   her dress spills across the restaurant's floor like a red shadow, darker than billboards of black bulls high above roadways, motionless but seeming to gallop like franco's brigades. all seeing is an act of war. tanks and artillery or spanish castles and mosques? i choose to lose, and beneath a watercolorist's sky study didi's splendor, nude against the unruffled backdrop of the alboran sea whose waves match my sighs and bomb this beach, launching sprays of white duds.  iii. córdoba, mezquita  even if he'd pulled over to study andalusia's road signs, after one thousand and one nights, he still could not make out its calligraphic script, its vertical lines, its dots, marks like smoke stilled from incense, its curled sand soft arabic, but this city's voice has coffins and carnations, and its hoarse singing shoots through him like twelve bars of earthen road that lengthens into a labyrinth of knowing blood beneath black skin. more echoes: the alhambra sent him back to the seraglio of his youth where a moorish guard stood in a museum, unfazed by a harem's rising laughter behind palace doors. here are pillars and banded arches to once again imagine the body passing through like a key into infinity. was this the answer to his ghetto past? but why travel so far? since a child, even in sleep, he voyaged and broke free, tossing dice in dreams, once below deck on a caravel next to grains of paradise. he's collecting a thousand faces. he's moving beneath eyelids, turning time into flesh. don't judge him. the courtyard's orange trees where once he washed like a morisco are teaching his tongue the craft.

 our grand peregrinations through these temporary cities, these pale window box poppies of the laughing class, drifting as if time came in the same long dollops as starlight, resemble an epic journey as a coffee bean resembles a llama’s foot, though the kitchen table may be far from the desert it’s near in spirit, a yellow oasis before the wind starts its restless sweeping of white flower-dust across the lintel, marking the fine edge of things like children asleep at the opera, piled up near the door, summer passing on its way out. prince valiant vowed to sew the horizons into a single idea, to put on the blue dress of distance, looping past rivers and mountains as one leaps from bed to bed to make loneliness lonely, the suburbs were for him a relief, a pageant of calm desire where he settled, all the king’s horses grazing on forsythia out back while the evening tilts back out of the night, a kindly drunk uncle, and asks you to stay. was this the end of traveling? or just a change in the story over time, as for example how tous les chevaux du roi become josie and the pussycats from one version to the next? so all heroes are deranged by something quite common yet unexpected, a constellation redrawn and named again through the stars above the porch don’t shift but seem to sink through winter’s pitcher of noircotic ink, leaving a single streetlight that burned happily, thinking it was the sun, after all it was the day of the night and turned the world around it, we were good sentences and forgot where we started.

 (1825) 1. cuvier  science, science, science! everything is beautiful  blown up beneath my glass. colors dazzle insect wings.  a drop of water swirls like marble. ordinary  crumbs become stalactites set in perfect angles  of geometry i’d thought impossible. few will  ever see what i see through this microscope.  cranial measurements crowd my notebook pages,  and i am moving closer, close to how these numbers  signify aspects of national character.  her genitalia will float inside a labeled  pickling jar in the musée de l’homme on a shelf  above broca’s brain: “the venus hottentot.”  elegant facts await me. small things in this world are mine.  2.  there is unexpected sun today in london, and the clouds that most days sift into this cage where i am working have dispersed. i am a black cutout against a captive blue sky, pivoting nude so the paying audience can view my naked buttocks.  i am called “venus hottentot.” i left capetown with a promise of revenue: half the profits and my passage home: a boon! master’s brother proposed the trip; the magistrate granted me leave. i would return to my family a duchess, with watered-silk  dresses and money to grow food, rouge and powders in glass pots, silver scissors, a lorgnette, voile and tulle instead of flax, cerulean blue instead of indigo. my brother would devour sugar-studded non- pareils, pale taffy, damask plums.  that was years ago. london’s circuses are florid and filthy, swarming with cabbage-smelling citizens who stare and query, “is it muscle? bone? or fat?” my neighbor to the left is the sapient pig, “the only scholar of his race.” he plays  at cards, tells time and fortunes by scraping his hooves. behind me is prince kar-mi, who arches like a rubber tree and stares back at the crowd from under the crook of his knee. a professional animal trainer shouts my cues. there are singing mice here.  “the ball of duchess dubarry”: in the engraving i lurch toward the belles dames, mad-eyed, and they swoon. men in capes and pince-nez shield them. tassels dance at my hips. in this newspaper lithograph my buttocks are shown swollen and luminous as a planet.  monsieur cuvier investigates between my legs, poking, prodding, sure of his hypothesis. i half expect him to pull silk scarves from inside me, paper poppies, then a rabbit! he complains at my scent and does not think i comprehend, but i speak  english. i speak dutch. i speak a little french as well, and languages monsieur cuvier will never know have names. now i am bitter and now i am sick. i eat brown bread, drink rancid broth. i miss good sun, miss mother’s sadza. my stomach  is frequently queasy from mutton chops, pale potatoes, blood sausage. i was certain that this would be better than farm life. i am the family entrepreneur! but there are hours in every day to conjur my imaginary daughters, in banana skirts  and ostrich-feather fans. since my own genitals are public i have made other parts private. in my silence i possess mouth, larynx, brain, in a single gesture. i rub my hair with lanolin, and pose in profile like a painted nubian  archer, imagining gold leaf woven through my hair, and diamonds. observe the wordless odalisque. i have not forgotten my xhosa clicks. my flexible tongue and healthy mouth bewilder this man with his rotting teeth. if he were to let me rise up  from this table, i’d spirit his knives and cut out his black heart, seal it with science fluid inside a bell jar, place it on a low shelf in a white man’s museum so the whole world could see it was shriveled and hard, geometric, deformed, unnatural.

 lepisosteus osseus despite it all, something stirs at the sight of the cool, enameled body, the unreflecting eye, and the long jaw like a chisel with its single, violent purpose.  it hangs dead still at the water's surface and seems lifeless, until a flickering gesture carves fish after fish from any school that swims too close  and creates in the world a new absence, as if this might be the shaper as well as the defacer of the damaged masterpiece whose headless body hails the bodies  of the many egyptians excised at cyprus.

 what are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?  the barbarians are due here today.   why isn’t anything going on in the senate? why are the senators sitting there without legislating?  because the barbarians are coming today. what’s the point of senators making laws now? once the barbarians are here, they’ll do the legislating.   why did our emperor get up so early, and why is he sitting enthroned at the city’s main gate, in state, wearing the crown?  because the barbarians are coming today and the emperor’s waiting to receive their leader. he’s even got a scroll to give him, loaded with titles, with imposing names.   why have our two consuls and praetors come out today wearing their embroidered, their scarlet togas? why have they put on bracelets with so many amethysts, rings sparkling with magnificent emeralds? why are they carrying elegant canes beautifully worked in silver and gold?  because the barbarians are coming today and things like that dazzle the barbarians.   why don’t our distinguished orators turn up as usual to make their speeches, say what they have to say?  because the barbarians are coming today and they’re bored by rhetoric and public speaking.   why this sudden bewilderment, this confusion? (how serious people’s faces have become.) why are the streets and squares emptying so rapidly, everyone going home lost in thought?  because night has fallen and the barbarians haven't come. and some of our men just in from the border say there are no barbarians any longer.   now what’s going to happen to us without barbarians? those people were a kind of solution.

 “what, to the american slave, is your 4th of july?” —frederick douglass i.  august 1619  arrived in a boat, named and unnamed, twenty, pirated  away from a portuguese slaver, traded for victuals.  drowned in this land of fresh, volatile clearings and folk  with skin like melted cowrie shells. soon shedding  servitude. soon reaping talents sown on african soil.  after indenture, christians, colonists. not english, but  not yet not-white. antoney and isabella, whose marriage  stretched the short shadows of america’s early afternoon  into the dusky reaches of evening, whose conjugal coitus spent  first the choice coin of africa on rough virginian citizenship,  baptized their son, william, into the church of england.   ii.  december 1638  fear must have shuddered into boston on the backs  of true believers — men and women of an unadorned god —  deep in the heavy black fabric of their coats and dresses like  a stench. black a mark of pride they wore as if branded,  never dreaming they could take it off. envy anticipated  their advent. glittered at them, settling in, from the knife  blades of the massachusetts. seeped like low-pitched  humming from the fur lining the natives’ warm  blankets. but desire docked in 1638. in from the harbor  flocked a people whose eyes sparked like stars, even near  death. whose hair promised a mixture of cotton and river  water and vines, a texture the fingers ached for. who  wholly inhabited a skin the midnight color of grace  that clarified the hue of the pilgrims’ woolen weeds. fear  and envy claimed pride of place, put desire’s cargo to good use.   iii.  march 1770  that night, crispus attucks dreamed. how he’d attacked  his would-be master and fled in wild-eyed search of self-  determination. discarded virginia on the run and ran  out of breath in salt-scented boston. found there, if not  freedom, fearlessness. a belief in himself that rocked things  with the uncontrolled power of the muscular atlantic, power  to cradle, to capsize. awoke angry again at the planter  who’d taken him for a mule or a machine. had shouldered  a chip the size of concord by the time the redcoat dared  to dare him. died wishing he’d amassed such revolutionary  ire in virginia. died dreaming great britain was the enemy.   iv.  july 4th: last but not least  17-, 18-, 19-76 and still this celebration’s shamed  with gunpowder and words that lie like martyrs in cold  blood. africa’s descendents, planting here year after year  the seeds of labor, sweating bullets in this nation’s warts,  have harvested the rope, the rape, the ghetto, the cell,  the fire, the flood, and the blame for you-name-it. so  today black folks barbeque ribs and smother the echoes  of billie’s strange song in sauces. drink gin. gladly  holiday to heckle speeches on tv. pretend to parade.  turn out in droves for distant detonations, chaos, controlled  as always, but directed away from us tonight. stare  into the mirror of the sky at our growing reflection,  boggled by how america gawks at the passing pinpoints  of flame, but overlooks the vast, ebony palm giving them shape.

 i try and try not to think about the wall. its profile, massive height and roughcut stonework all stir up fear, gloom, exaltation, pride, and numbness, in a jumble hard to name.  no one knows who had it built, or when; five hundred years ago, the locals guess; but sunset trumpet calls depict it gold enough to have been there more than a thousand.  the thing held off  invasions, true—but not always, our history records defeats. nowadays we never get invaders, or else they're us, going beyond its limits  to acquire new territory and subjects. though weaker stretches have sheared off and fallen, herders fence up their sheepfolds at the base, and some blocks are dragged off to build new houses.  topside, binoculars can sight its ramparts winding through dark-blue mountains farther north . . . that monumental, chill indifference explains why boys graffiti names on it  (or jokes), no matter if their scrawny slashes in time begin to erode. decades ago, i gouged in mine, it wasn't yet forbidden. luckily, dense vines screen the signature,  made at an age when we assume our name amounts to more than permanent stone structures. oh, even now it sparks a vocal reflex when i move the leaves and read it there again.

 this dry night, nothing unusual about the clip, clop, casual  iron of his shoes as he stamps death like a mint on the innocent coinage of earth.  i lift the window, watch the ambling feather of hock and fetlock, loosed from its daily tether  in the tinker camp on the enniskerry road, pass, his breath hissing, his snuffling head  down. he is gone. no great harm is done. only a leaf of our laurel hedge is torn—  of distant interest like a maimed limb, only a rose which now will never climb  the stone of our house, expendable, a mere line of defence against him, a volunteer  you might say, only a crocus, its bulbous head blown from growth, one of the screamless dead.  but we, we are safe, our unformed fear of fierce commitment gone; why should we care  if a rose, a hedge, a crocus are uprooted like corpses, remote, crushed, mutilated?  he stumbles on like a rumour of war, huge threatening. neighbours use the subterfuge  of curtains. he stumbles down our short street thankfully passing us. i pause, wait,  then to breathe relief lean on the sill and for a second only my blood is still  with atavism. that rose he smashed frays ribboned across our hedge, recalling days  of burned countryside, illicit braid: a cause ruined before, a world betrayed.  
NEW POEM
 do not weep, maiden, for war is kind. because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky and the affrighted steed ran on alone, do not weep. war is kind.  hoarse, booming drums of the regiment, little souls who thirst for fight, these men were born to drill and die. the unexplained glory flies above them, great is the battle-god, great, and his kingdom— a field where a thousand corpses lie.  do not weep, babe, for war is kind. because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches, raged at his breast, gulped and died, do not weep. war is kind.  swift, blazing flag of the regiment, eagle with crest of red and gold, these men were born to drill and die. point for them the virtue of slaughter, make plain to them the excellence of killing and a field where a thousand corpses lie.  mother whose heart hung humble as a button on the bright splendid shroud of your son, do not weep. war is kind.  
NEW POEM
 working with one eye closed or heads buried under their drapes, they focus to preserve the drowned shell-hole, the salient's rubble of dead, the bleached bones of sepoys torn from the earth.  their stills haunt us: a stretcher piled with skulls at cold harbour, graves in a barren wood that in one hour's carnage lost its name to history and the world's memory of death.  the worst has happened, they confirm the worst: but show us too the makeshift hospital, the sad errand of the hospital van among the ruins. also enough of sky to suggest the infinity of angles,  that behind sandbags, under the hostile towers someone is finding time for a wry note on bowel movements, an entry that affirms the loved salience of what is always there: flower of auschwitz, bird of the western front.  
NEW POEM
 war the war, the sorry edge of us, because we stacked nice  clean plates for days, we were sure things when love broke  across the headland, leaving conch shells in ditches,  five fish slapping on the steps of the old town hall, it was winter,  we were bonfires unattended, our bodies litigating, agreeing  and writing it all down, the law of legs, the law of how we sleep,  the law of shoulders killing me, and now we fold clothes without  thinking my clothes your clothes and war the war o happy war  what love we are so badly bitten in this long-term necessary chapel  with all attendant relics, citronella candle, junior hacksaw,  a box of miscellaneous wires, our headland way-way underwater,  no one else beside us but ourselves beside ourselves.

 for judith radstone next to my own skin, her pearls. my mistress bids me wear them, warm them, until evening when i'll brush her hair. at six, i place them round her cool, white throat. all day i think of her,  resting in the yellow room, contemplating silk or taffeta, which gown tonight? she fans herself whilst i work willingly, my slow heat entering each pearl. slack on my neck, her rope.  she's beautiful. i dream about her in my attic bed; picture her dancing with tall men, puzzled by my faint, persistent scent beneath her french perfume, her milky stones.  i dust her shoulders with a rabbit's foot, watch the soft blush seep through her skin like an indolent sigh. in her looking-glass my red lips part as though i want to speak.  full moon. her carriage brings her home. i see her every movement in my head.... undressing, taking off her jewels, her slim hand reaching for the case, slipping naked into bed, the way  she always does.... and i lie here awake, knowing the pearls are cooling even now in the room where my mistress sleeps. all night i feel their absence and i burn.

 droning a drowsy syncopated tune, rocking back and forth to a mellow croon, i heard a negro play. down on lenox avenue the other night by the pale dull pallor of an old gas light he did a lazy sway. . . . he did a lazy sway. . . . to the tune o’ those weary blues. with his ebony hands on each ivory key he made that poor piano moan with melody. o blues! swaying to and fro on his rickety stool he played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool. sweet blues! coming from a black man’s soul. o blues! in a deep song voice with a melancholy tone i heard that negro sing, that old piano moan— “ain’t got nobody in all this world, ain’t got nobody but ma self. i’s gwine to quit ma frownin’ and put ma troubles on the shelf.”  thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor. he played a few chords then he sang some more— “i got the weary blues and i can’t be satisfied. got the weary blues and can’t be satisfied— i ain’t happy no mo’ and i wish that i had died.” and far into the night he crooned that tune. the stars went out and so did the moon. the singer stopped playing and went to bed while the weary blues echoed through his head. he slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.  
NEW POEM
 you find yourself in a narrow bed you’ve never slept in, on a tree-lined grassy field you’ve never walked upon, on a cold toilet seat you have not sat on, in a place you now call your home, your learning, your future. red stone pathways expose the buildings that will house the knowledge you seek, and the information you want to gather.  you crane your neck to look up at the 13-story brick tower rising from the ground, looming over you as you walk past. the melodies and beats of different songs mix, create a sound of their own, flow from open windows. crushed leeks top ramen noodles ground into a blue and speckled carpet attract armies of ants to the communal kitchen on the sixth floor.  you pull your jacket tighter against your body, strong, salty wind whips off the sound, and up the hill as you walk through red square toward the clatter of knives, forks and digesting bellies.  finally, you are released like a white dove from the hands of its owner, allowed to fly discovering your dreams, discovering what you are made of.

 an axe rang sharply ’mid those forest shades which from creation toward the skies had tower’d in unshorn beauty. there, with vigorous arm wrought a bold emigrant, and by his side his little son, with question and response, beguiled the toil. ‘boy, thou hast never seen such glorious trees. hark, when their giant trunks fall, how the firm earth groans. rememberest thou the mighty river, on whose breast we sail’d, so many days, on toward the setting sun? our own connecticut, compar’d to that, was but a creeping stream.’ ‘father, the brook that by our door went singing, where i launch’d my tiny boat, with my young playmates round, when school was o’er, is dearer far to me, than all these bold, broad waters. to my eye they are as strangers. and those little trees my mother nutur’d in the garden bound, of our first home, from whence the fragrant peach hung in its ripening gold, were fairer sure, than this dark forest, shutting out the day.’ —‘what, ho! – my little girl,’ and with light step a fairy creature hasted toward her sire, and setting down the basket that contain’d his noon-repast, look’d upward to his face with sweet, confiding smile. ‘see, dearest, see, that bright-wing’d paroquet, and hear the song of yon gay red-bird, echoing through the trees, making rich music. didst thou ever hear, in far new england, such a mellow tone?’ —‘i had a robin that did take the crumbs each night and morning, and his chirping voice still made me joyful, as i went to tend my snow-drops. i was always laughing then in that first home. i should be happier now methinks, if i could find among these dells the same fresh violets.’ slow night drew on, and round the rude hut of the emigrant the wrathful spirit of the rising storm spake bitter things. his weary children slept, and he, with head declin’d, sat listening long to the swoln waters of the illinois, dashing against their shores. starting he spake,— ‘wife! did i see thee brush away a tear? ’twas even so. thy heard was with the halls of thy nativity. their sparkling lights, carpets, and sofas, and admiring guests, befit thee better than these rugged walls of shapeless logs, and this lone, hermit home.’ ‘no – no. all was so still around, methought upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal, which ’mid the church where erst we paid our vows, so tuneful peal’d. but tenderly thy voice dissolv’d the illusion.’ and the gentle smile lighting her brow, the fond caress that sooth’d her waking infant, reassur’d his soul that wheresoe’er our best affections dwell, and strike a healthful root, is happiness. content, and placid, to his rest he sank, but dreams, those wild magicians, that do play such pranks when reason slumbers, tireless wrought their will with him. up rose the thronging mart of his own native city, – roof and spire, all glittering bright, in fancy’s frost-work ray. the steed his boyhood nurtur’d proudly neigh’d, the favorite dog came frisking round his feet, with shrill and joyous bark, – familiar doors flew open, – greeting hands with his were link’d in friendship’s grasp, – he heard the keen debate from congregated haunts, where mind with mind doth blend and brighten, – and till morning rov’d ’mid the loved scenery of his native land.

 what is the sound of sounds  sounding indefinite fist in face again and  sound of the surprise of it coming  from nowhere, of breaking the arm  on a small fall in your own house,  a respiratory failure, wound opening like a little mouth.  we inhabit the brutal. we are shattered everyday.  we look askew. head broken floor array, light  array, great distances, life goals.  staked upon every border,  guardians. protections have many faces.  misuse of the face as a streaming  desire. solution posted: “get rid of all the niggers.”   the state exacts its controls.  that the pepper spray happens against kneeling children—  that the search for the secret leaker is unyielding—  if you want, you can make a myopic focus, concentrate  on a shone shadow or drift off into space.

 dear ol' dirty bastard: i too like it raw, i don't especially care for duke ellington at a birthday party. i care less and less about the shapes of shapes because forms change and nothing is more durable than feeling. my uncle used the money i gave him to buy a few vials of what looked like candy after the party where my grandma sang in an outfit that was obviously made for a west african king. my motto is never mistake what it is for what it looks like. my generosity, for example, is mostly a form of vanity. a bandanna is a useful handkerchief, but a handkerchief is a useless-ass bandanna. this only looks like a footnote in my report concerning the party.trill stands for what is truly real though it may be hidden by the houses just over the hills between us, by the hands on the bars between us. that picture of my grandmother with my uncle when he was a baby is not trill. what it is is the feeling felt seeing garbagemen drift along the predawn avenues, a sloppy slow rain taking its time to the coast. milquetoast is not trill, nor is bouillabaisse.bakku-shan is japanese for a woman who is beautiful only when viewed from behind. like i was saying, my motto is never mistake what it looks like for what it is

 1963 what shall i tell my children who are black of what it means to be a captive in this dark skin what shall i tell my dear one, fruit of my womb, of how beautiful they are when everywhere they turn they are faced with abhorrence of everything that is black. villains are black with black hearts. a black cow gives no milk. a black hen lays no eggs. bad news comes bordered in black, black is evil and evil is black and devils' food is black…  what shall i tell my dear ones raised in a white world a place where white has been made to represent all that is good and pure and fine and decent. where clouds are white, and dolls, and heaven surely is a white, white place with angels robed in white, and cotton candy and ice cream and milk and ruffled sunday dresses and dream houses and long sleek cadillacs and angel's food is white…all, all…white.  what can i say therefore, when my child comes home in tears because a playmate has called him black, big lipped, flatnosed and nappy headed? what will he think when i dry his tears and whisper, "yes, that's true. but no less beautiful and dear." how shall i lift up his head, get him to square his shoulders, look his adversaries in the eye, confident of the knowledge of his worth, serene under his sable skin and proud of his own beauty?  what can i do to give him strength that he may come through life's adversities as a whole human being unwarped and human in a world of biased laws and inhuman practices, that he might survive. and survive he must! for who knows? perhaps this black child here bears the genius to discover the cure for…cancer or to chart the course for exploration of the universe. so, he must survive for the good of all humanity. he must and will survive. i have drunk deeply of late from the foundation of my black culture, sat at the knee and learned from mother africa, discovered the truth of my heritage, the truth, so often obscured and omitted. and i find i have much to say to my black children.  i will lift up their heads in proud blackness with the story of their fathers and their fathers fathers. and i shall take them into a way back time of kings and queens who ruled the nile, and measured the stars and discovered the laws of mathematics. upon whose backs have been built the wealth of continents. i will tell him this and more. and his heritage shall be his weapon and his armor; will make him strong enough to win any battle he may face. and since this story is often obscured, i must sacrifice to find it for my children, even as i sacrificed to feed, clothe and shelter them. so this i will do for them if i love them. none will do it for me. i must find the truth of heritage for myself and pass it on to them. in years to come i believe because i have armed them with the truth, my children and my children's children will venerate me. for it is the truth that will make us free!

 the birds against the april wind flew northward, singing as they flew; they sang, “the land we leave behind has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew.”  “o wild-birds, flying from the south, what saw and heard ye, gazing down?” “we saw the mortar’s upturned mouth, the sickened camp, the blazing town!  “beneath the bivouac’s starry lamps, we saw your march-worn children die; in shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps, we saw your dead uncoffined lie.  “we heard the starving prisoner’s sighs and saw, from line and trench, your sons follow our flight with home-sick eyes beyond the battery’s smoking guns.”  “and heard and saw ye only wrong and pain,” i cried, “o wing-worn flocks?” “we heard,” they sang, “the freedman’s song, the crash of slavery’s broken locks!  “we saw from new, uprising states the treason-nursing mischief spurned, as, crowding freedom’s ample gates, the long-estranged and lost returned.  “o’er dusky faces, seamed and old, and hands horn-hard with unpaid toil, with hope in every rustling fold, we saw your star-dropt flag uncoil.  “and struggling up through sounds accursed, a grateful murmur clomb the air; a whisper scarcely heard at first, it filled the listening heavens with prayer.  “and sweet and far, as from a star, replied a voice which shall not cease, till, drowning all the noise of war, it sings the blessed song of peace!”  so to me, in a doubtful day of chill and slowly greening spring, low stooping from the cloudy gray, the wild-birds sang or seemed to sing.  they vanished in the misty air, the song went with them in their flight; but lo! they left the sunset fair, and in the evening there was light.

NEW POEM
 the time has been that these wild solitudes, yet beautiful as wild, were trod by me oftener than now; and when the ills of life had chafed my spirit—when the unsteady pulse beat with strange flutterings—i would wander forth and seek the woods. the sunshine on my path was to me a friend. the swelling hills, the quiet dells retiring far between, with gentle invitation to explore their windings, were a calm society that talked with me and soothed me. then the chant of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget the thoughts that broke my peace, and i began to gather simples by the fountain’s brink, and lose myself in day-dreams. while i stood in nature’s loneliness, i was with one with whom i early grew familiar, one who never had a frown for me, whose voice never rebuked me for the hours i stole from cares i loved not, but of which the world deems highest, to converse with her. when shrieked the bleak november winds, and smote the woods, and the brown fields were herbless, and the shades, that met above the merry rivulet, were spoiled, i sought, i loved them still; they seemed like old companions in adversity. still there was beauty in my walks; the brook, bordered with sparkling frost-work, was as gay as with its fringe of summer flowers. afar, the village with its spires, the path of streams and dim receding valleys, hid before by interposing trees, lay visible through the bare grove, and my familiar haunts seemed new to me. nor was i slow to come among them, when the clouds, from their still skirts, had shaken down on earth the feathery snow, and all was white. the pure keen air abroad, albeit it breathed no scent of herb, nor heard love-call of bird nor merry hum of bee, was not the air of death. bright mosses crept over the spotted trunks, and the close buds, that lay along the boughs, instinct with life, patient, and waiting the soft breath of spring, feared not the piercing spirit of the north. the snow-bird twittered on the beechen bough, and ’neath the hemlock, whose thick branches bent beneath its bright cold burden, and kept dry a circle, on the earth, of withered leaves, the partridge found a shelter. through the snow the rabbit sprang away. the lighter track of fox, and the raccoon’s broad path, were there, crossing each other. from his hollow tree the squirrel was abroad, gathering the nuts just fallen, that asked the winter cold and sway of winter blast, to shake them from their hold.  but winter has yet brighter scenes—he boasts splendors beyond what gorgeous summer knows; or autumn with his many fruits, and woods all flushed with many hues. come when the rains have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice, while the slant of sun of february pours into the bowers a flood of light. approach! the incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps, and the broad arching portals of the grove welcome thy entering. look! the massy trunks are cased in pure crystal; each light spray, nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven, is studded with its trembling water-drops, that glimmer with an amethystine light. but round the parent-stem the long low boughs bend, in a glittering ring, and arbors hide the glassy floor. oh! you might deem the spot the spacious cavern of some virgin mine, deep in the womb of earth—where the gems grow, and diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud with amethyst and topaz—and the place lit up, most royally, with the pure beam that dwells in them. or haply the vast hall of fairy palace, that outlasts the night, and fades not in the glory of the sun;— where crystal columns send forth slender shafts and crossing arches; and fantastic aisles wind from the sight in brightness, and are lost among the crowded pillars. raise thine eye; thou seest no cavern roof; no palace vault; there the blue sky and the white drifting cloud look in. again the wildered fancy dreams of spouting fountains, frozen as they rose, and fixed, with all their branching jets, in air, and all their sluices sealed. all, all is light; light without shade. but all shall pass away with the next sun. from numberless vast trunks loosened, the crashing ice shall make a sound like the far roar of rivers, and the eve shall close o’er the brown woods as it was wont.  and it is pleasant, when the noisy streams are just set free, and milder suns melt off the plashy snow, save only the firm drift in the deep glen or the close shade of pines— ’tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke roll up among the maples of the hill, where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes the shriller echo, as the clear pure lymph, that from the wounded trees, in twinkling drops, falls, mid the golden brightness of the morn, is gathered in with brimming pails, and oft, wielded by sturdy hands, the stroke of axe makes the woods ring. along the quiet air, come and float calmly off the soft light clouds, such as you see in summer, and the winds scarce stir the branches. lodged in sunny cleft, where the cold breezes come not, blooms alone the little wind-flower, whose just opened eye is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at— startling the loiterer in the naked groves with unexpected beauty, for the time of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar. and ere it comes, the encountering winds shall oft muster their wrath again, and rapid clouds shade heaven, and bounding on the frozen earth shall fall their volleyed stores, rounded like hail and white like snow, and the loud north again shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage.  
NEW POEM
 in ocean's wide domains, half buried in the sands, lie skeletons in chains, with shackled feet and hands.  beyond the fall of dews, deeper than plummet lies, float ships, with all their crews, no more to sink nor rise.  there the black slave-ship swims, freighted with human forms, whose fettered, fleshless limbs are not the sport of storms.  these are the bones of slaves; they gleam from the abyss; they cry, from yawning waves, "we are the witnesses!"  within earth's wide domains are markets for men's lives; their necks are galled with chains, their wrists are cramped with gyves.  dead bodies, that the kite in deserts makes its prey; murders, that with affright scare school-boys from their play!  all evil thoughts and deeds; anger, and lust, and pride; the foulest, rankest weeds, that choke life's groaning tide!  these are the woes of slaves; they glare from the abyss; they cry, from unknown graves, "we are the witnesses!"

NEW POEM
 in the northwest corner of dakota, i saw a room someone had left, a plush sofa returning its button- eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder, the dog, too, turning. in the next room, the mattress, with mattress stories one after another tumbling out of each spring, the window she opened first thing, its vista of mile after mile, and the windmill hauling its load. i saw that, and nothing alive—  green oil-figured linoleum laid on counters, nails of bad craft, the ripped blackening edge that scared her more than the bed and the sound of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer night after night, the whack of her blade on the block. there are houses with too many knives sometimes she said,  but when june ferned its way in she'd relent, take on its restraint, heave again on the stained sheets her burden of child, herself a torn girl again, combing her hair through fingers bruised by corn shocks, sweet juice in the cuts of her life.  she began to think of the border and mustangs without brand. at night they'd bend over the bed and nuzzle. one ride was enough. she had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare over the windowsill. i see where the curtain fell and nobody mended the tear, i see where bare feet marked like fossils her pass in the rain.  when he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring, why does he always think of that first sight of her thigh in the peach-colored dress, of his hand's searching moss with its red-gold stamens, the spring in that arid landscape like something from canaan under his tongue? even in old age he'd ponder the moment, lying under the moon forgiving himself, her, the world that bred their conundrum, washed in that rain.  
NEW POEM
 when the first dark had fallen around them and the leaves were weary of praise, in the clear silence beauty found them and shewed them all her ways.  in the high noon of the heavenly garden where the angels sunned with the birds, beauty, before their hearts could harden, had taught them heavenly words.  when they fled in the burning weather and nothing dawned but a dream, beauty fasted their hands together and cooled them at her stream.  and when day wearied and night grew stronger, and they slept as the beautiful must, then she bided a little longer, and blossomed from their dust.  
NEW POEM
 (to f. w. harvey) out of the smoke and dust of the little room with tea-talk loud and laughter of happy boys, i passed into the dusk. suddenly the noise ceased with a shock, left me alone in the gloom, to wonder at the miracle hanging high tangled in twigs, the silver crescent clear. time passed from mind. time died; and then we were once more at home together, you and i.  the elms with arms of love wrapped us in shade who watched the ecstatic west with one desire, one soul uprapt; and still another fire consumed us, and our joy yet greater made: that bach should sing for us, mix us in one the joy of firelight and the sunken sun.

 she looked nearly the same but when i hugged her there was substantially more to her—no doubt as with me. she fibbed as i did at the edge of curb under the streetlight as spiders dropped like tiny parachutes—they were difficult to see. on the periphery of good luck, i thought, revisiting her quirky habits and expressions, what i eventually found so bothersome. except when i glanced at my watch i discovered i was trembling like a small-time embezzler. i see, she said, you must have an appointment. the driveways and hedges funneling back into darkness, into someone else's childhood, where speech was an obstacle. wild turkeys approaching across the lawn. oh no, i said, i'm just so pleased to see you. but that didn't make sense either. she cocked her head, a woman with grown twins and three conniving husbands. even my toes felt damp. i remember, she said, when you'd lay your head on my lap, i'd stroke your hair— i didn't recall. though i thought that would be a good idea now. but i'm married, i said. i own my own business. it would have been helpful if i'd planned some banter. i'm a high school principal, she told me, i don't put up with horseshit from anyone. i brushed the arm of her jacket—she merely stared. a door slammed. a grown idiot drooled in an attic somewhere down the lane. i had another image as well, one that held an odor of patchouli oil. as she stepped forward without caution, placed a hand on my neck. take me, she insisted, to those rivets of flame following wire—because this is it, you'll never have another hour. i immediately felt calmer...

 ah, silly pug, wert thou so sore afraid? mourn not, my wat, nor be thou so dismayed. it passeth fickle fortune’s power and skill to force my heart to think thee any ill. no fortune base, thou sayest, shall alter thee? and may so blind a witch so conquer me? no, no, my pug, though fortune were not blind, assure thyself she could not rule my mind. fortune, i know, sometimes doth conquer kings, and rules and reigns on earth and earthly things, but never think fortune can bear the sway if virtue watch, and will her not obey. ne chose i thee by fickle fortune’s rede, ne she shall force me alter with such speed but if to try this mistress’ jest with thee. pull up thy heart, suppress thy brackish tears, torment thee not, but put away thy fears. dead to all joys and living unto woe, slain quite by her that ne’er gave wise men blow, revive again and live without all dread, the less afraid, the better thou shalt speed.

 “who is beatrice,” wondered walter b., “to give beatrice up her hope?” beatrice sulked under her cauliflower-colored hat. “it is like,” said beatrice, “i can barely crack another joke.” “this is correct,” said walter b. “it is most certainly like that. nevertheless, whoever you are it is not up to you to give up your hope. and additionally you are spoiling the day.” “what is ‘giving up your hope’?” asked beatrice. “it is when,” explained walter b., “you have to ask.”  *  it all began with the appearance of the unlikelies. it was difficult to anticipate in these small men sitting cross-legged on the living room floor the havoc they would bring. they held hands. they sang a song about trees, and as they sang their tree-shaped ears swelled with what beatrice would later describe as pride. they asked for gently steamed vegetables. they seemed genuinely concerned. “pick a heart,” they cheered, “any heart.” beatrice picked one. “expect for that one.” beatrice picked another. “and that one, too.” “that was less joyous,” said beatrice, “than i’d expected.” “the hearts you picked,” explained the unlikelies, “had been picked yesterday.” “it is unlikely,” said the unlikelies, “that will happen again.” walter b. hid in the kitchen. whose side the unlikelies were on, beatrice began to wonder. “pick a heart,” they urged. beatrice picked another. “except for that one.” beatrice picked another. “and that one, too.” with each heart beatrice picked the unlikelies grew larger. they seemed genuinely concerned. “all is dare,” they reminded beatrice with their mouths full of broccoli, and carrots, and peas, “in blur and core.” by dawn, walter b. could still hear beatrice picking hearts. their empty husks filled the floor. the unlikelies huddled closer together. “except for that one,” they mumbled sleepily, moving closer to the door. the unlikelies were, by now, as big as the furniture. “and that one, too.” walter b. hid in the kitchen. he imagined he would make out of all the husks a hearty soup. he rummaged for a pot. he would feed beatrice the soup, drop by drop, until she forgot this highly unlikely event impossible to forsee by any hopeful thing. “all is spare in buds and more,” promised the unlikelies, as they squeezed their enormous bodies out the door.  *  days later, when beatrice asked walter b. if the unlikelies were still standing outside in the sunlight, congratulating each other, walter b. said “no.” but beatrice knew they were there. and she knew they would return for her. they seemed genuinely concerned.  
NEW POEM
 i was born in boston in 1949. i never wanted this fact to be known, in fact i’ve spent the better half of my adult life trying to sweep my early years under the carpet and have a life that was clearly just mine and independent of the historic fate of my family. can you imagine what it was like to be one of them, to be built like them, to talk like them to have the benefits of being born into such a wealthy and powerful american family. i went to the best schools, had all kinds of tutors and trainers, traveled widely, met the famous, the controversial, and the not-so-admirable and i knew from a very early age that if there were ever any possibility of escaping the collective fate of this famous boston family i would take that route and i have. i hopped on an amtrak to new york in the early ‘70s and i guess you could say my hidden years began. i thought well i’ll be a poet. what could be more foolish and obscure. i became a lesbian. every woman in my family looks like a dyke but it’s really stepping off the flag when you become one. while holding this ignominious pose i have seen and i have learned and i am beginning to think there is no escaping history. a woman i am currently having an affair with said you know  you look like a kennedy. i felt the blood rising in my cheeks. people have always laughed at my boston accent confusing “large” for “lodge,” “party” for “potty.” but when this unsuspecting woman invoked for the first time my family name i knew the jig was up. yes, i am, i am a kennedy. my attempts to remain obscure have not served me well. starting as a humble poet i quickly climbed to the top of my profession assuming a position of leadership and honor. it is right that a woman should call me out now. yes, i am a kennedy. and i await your orders. you are the new americans. the homeless are wandering the streets of our nation’s greatest city. homeless men with aids are among them. is that right? that there are no homes for the homeless, that there is no free medical help for these men.and women. that they get the message —as they are dying— that this is not their home? and how are your teeth today? can you afford to fix them? how high is your rent? if art is the highest and most honest form of communication of our times and the young artist is no longer able to move here to speak to her time…yes, i could, but that was 15 years ago and remember—as i must i am a kennedy. shouldn’t we all be kennedys? this nation’s greatest city is home of the business- man and home of the rich artist. people with beautiful teeth who are not on the streets. what shall we do about this dilemma? listen, i have been educated. i have learned about western civilization. do you know what the message of western civilization is? i am alone. am i alone tonight? i don’t think so. am i the only one with bleeding gums tonight. am i the only homosexual in this room tonight. am i the only one whose friends have died, are dying now. and my art can’t be supported until it is gigantic, bigger than everyone else’s, confirming the audience’s feeling that they are alone. that they alone are good, deserved to buy the tickets to see this art. are working, are healthy, should survive, and are normal. are you normal tonight? everyone here, are we all normal. it is not normal for me to be a kennedy. but i am no longer ashamed, no longer alone. i am not alone tonight because we are all kennedys. and i am your president.

 inside me is a black-eyed animal bracing in a small stall. as if a bird could grow without breaking its shell. as if the clatter of a thousand black birds whipping in a storm could be held in a shell. inside me is a huge black bull balled small enough to fit inside the bead of a nipple ring. i mean to leave a record of my raptures. i was raised by a beautiful man. i loved his grasp of time. my mother shaped my grasp of space. would you rather spend the rest of eternity with your wild wings bewildering a cage or with your four good feet stuck in a plot of dirt?

 the sovereign beauty which i do admire, witness the world how worthy to be praised: the light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire in my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised; that being now with her huge brightness dazed, base thing i can no more endure to view; but looking still on her, i stand amazed at wondrous sight of so celestial hue. so when my tongue would speak her praises due, it stopped is with thought's astonishment: and when my pen would write her titles true, it ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment: yet in my heart i then both speak and write the wonder that my wit cannot endite.

 he faced the sink, one foot up on the edge of the tub. she stood behind him, reaching around. in the mirror, her face rose over his shoulder like the moon, and like the moon she regarded him beautifully but without feeling, and he looked at her as he would at the moon:how beautiful! how distant! no smiling, no weeping, no talking. a man and a woman transacting their magnificent business with the usual equanimity. the man as a passenger walking the ship’s deck at evening and the woman as the moon over his shoulder oiling the ocean with light. deep in the ship’s belly pistons churned and sailors fed the boilers' roar with coal. on deck just the engine’s dull thrum and a faint click as the woman sets her ring on the cool white lip of the sink.

 clamber out of the morning river with water beads like fish eggs clung to your pubis the calluses on your buttocks from sitting, writing on flat rocks, your goose-pimpled thighs—the bumpy tongues of two dogs licking each other—and river-slather and slather at the edge of my mouth.  you are smiling, straining out your hair, flicking your hands, and then see me watching you with the cloth and pots i was taking to wash. before i have time to be embarrassed, the smile lifts into your eyes.      each “appleblossom” is a verse translation from the japanese of a short selection from the notebooks of chiri, bashō’s traveling companion during the years between withered chestnuts and travelogue of weatherbeaten bones .

 i sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers, of april, may, of june, and july flowers. i sing of may-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes, of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal-cakes. i write of youth, of love, and have access by these to sing of cleanly wantonness. i sing of dews, of rains, and piece by piece of balm, of oil, of spice, and ambergris. i sing of time's trans-shifting; and i write how roses first came red, and lilies white. i write of groves, of twilights, and i sing the court of mab, and of the fairy king. i write of hell; i sing (and ever shall) of heaven, and hope to have it after all.

 while lovers sleep, i dig my nails into the earth,  holding up traffic. just now a cloud has pulled up while i was talking to the emptiness  of the universe and my voice plugged into the waves  at the bottom of the ocean. my heart is taped up like a child’s drawing  of the moon over the broken window of the sky  where the wind always comes back to fill my lungs. i will dance on my shadow. i will open my mouth  with the air inside my mother’s coffin.  i will be the arrow breaking apart in the body of the blackbird, which appears at my window, singing.

 the wisest scholar of the wight most wise by phoebus’ doom, with sugared sentence says that virtue, if it once met with our eyes, strange flames of love it in our souls would raise; but, for that man with pain this truth descries, while he each thing in sense’s balance weighs, and so nor will nor can behold those skies which inward sun to heroic mind displays, virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir love of herself, takes stella’s shape, that she to mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her. it is most true, for since i her did see, virtue’s great beauty in that face i prove, and find th’effect, for i do burn in love.

 having this day my horse, my hand, my lance guided so well that i obtain'd the prize, both by the judgment of the english eyes and of some sent from that sweet enemy france; horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance, town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise; some lucky wits impute it but to chance; others, because of both sides i do take my blood from them who did excel in this, think nature me a man of arms did make. how far they shot awry! the true cause is, stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.

 what, have i thus betrayed my liberty? can those black beams such burning marks engrave in my free side? or am i born a slave, whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny? or want i sense to feel my misery? or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have? who for long faith, though daily help i crave, may get no alms but scorn of beggary. virtue, awake! beauty but beauty is; i may, i must, i can, i will, i do leave following that which it is gain to miss. let her go. soft, but here she comes. go to, unkind, i love you not! o me, that eye doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!

 who will in fairest book of nature know how virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be, let him but learn of love to read in thee, stella, those fair lines which true goodness show. there shall he find all vices' overthrow, not by rude force, but sweetest sovereignty of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly; that inward sun in thine eyes shineth so. and, not content to be perfection's heir thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move, who mark in thee what is in thee most fair. so while thy beauty draws thy heart to love, as fast thy virtue bends that love to good: but "ah," desire still cries, "give me some food!"

 at nights birds hammered my unborn child’s heart to strength, each strike bringing  bones and spine to glow, her lungs pestled loud as the sea i was raised a sea anemone  among women who cursed their hearts out, soured themselves, never-brides,  into veranda shades, talcum and tea moistened their quivering jaws, prophetic without prophecy.  anvil-black, gleaming garlic nubs, the pageant arrived with sails unfurled from colchis and i rejoiced like a broken  asylum to see burning sand grains, skittering ice; shekels clapped in my chest, i smashed my head against a lightbulb  and light sprinkled my hair; i rejoiced, a poui tree hit by the sun in the room, a man, a man.

 and the black water under the boats with their pools of bilge rainbowed out like rinds of steak fat, the salt thick in my nostrils, but pleasant, too: details i still remember from bishop’s poem, everything else about it lost. at the docks, i watched my friend slip in her rubber boots; the wide, wet planks glossy with mosses. you must walk duckfooted to get to the boats, the black and orange fishing barrels, the air with its tang of rusted metals. there are always hooks and anchors to be found, nets and scrapings of wood planed by chisel, the way my great-grandmother was said to have worked, employed as a shipwright on the city’s waterways in the ’30s according to the newspaper clipping my grandmother photocopies for me each christmas. the description of her gunmetal hair and slim torso clad in overalls, the hands she held out for the times reporter (“callused,” he noted, “strong as a man’s”) does not recall the woman i remember for her farm in bothell before it became a seattle suburb, helping me gather raspberries from the long canes she planted by her porch. we spent an afternoon together sweating in the same long-sleeved checkered shirts she’d sewn us, according to the photo i no longer have, and cannot remember whether is the source or confirmation of this memory: only the papery, gray-green streaks of road dust on the canes, a bowl of chipped porcelain inside of which were raspberries. very red, very sweet, furred like my friend’s upper lip i remember between my teeth as we stood on the docks. the smell of iron and winter mist, her mouth like nothing i have tasted since.

 i like it when they get together and talk in voices that sound like apple trees and grape vines,  and some of them wear hats and go to arizona in the winter, and they all like to play cards.  they will always be the ones who say “it is time to go now,” even as we linger at the door,  or stand by the waiting cars, they remember someone—an uncle we never knew—and sigh, all  of them together, like wind in the oak trees behind the farm where they grew up—a place  i remember—especially the hen house and the soft clucking that filled the sunlit yard.

 out in the yard, my sister and i tore thread from century plants to braid into bracelets, ate chalky green bananas, threw coconuts onto the sidewalk to crack their hard, hairy skulls.  the world had begun to happen, but not time. we would live forever, sunburnt and pricker-stuck, our promises written in blood. not yet  would men or illness distinguish us, our thoughts cleave us in two. if she squeezed sour calamondins into a potion, i drank it. when i jumped from the fig tree, she jumped.

 i'm remembering again, the day we stood on the porch and you smoked while the old man told you about his basement full of wine, his bad heart and the doctor's warning, how he held the dusty bottle out to you, glad, he said, to give it away to someone who appreciated its value and spirit, the years it took to settle into its richness and worth. i'm watching again, each cell alive, as you reach for the wine, your forearm exposed below the rolled sleeve, the fine hairs that sweep along the muscle, glowing, lifting a little in the afternoon breeze. i'm memorizing the shape of the moment: your hand and the small bones lengthening beneath the skin as it tightens in the gripping, in the receiving of the gift, the exact texture and color of your skin, and the old man's face, reduced to its essence. that, and the brief second when both of you had a hand on the bottle— the thing not yet given, not yet taken, but held between you, stoppered, full. and my body is flooded again with an elemental joy, holding onto it against another day in the unknowable future when i'm given terrible news, some dark burden i'll be forced to carry. i know this is useless, and can't possibly work, but i'm saving that moment, for balance.

 he that had come that morning, one after the other, over seven hills, each of a new color,  came now by the last tree, by the red-colored valley, to a gray river wide as the sea.  there at the shingle a listing wherry awash with dark water; what should it carry?  there on the shelving, three dark gentlemen. might they direct him? three gentlemen.  “cable, friend john, john cable,” when they saw him they said, “come and be company as far as the far side.”  “come follow the feet,” they said, “of your family, of your old father that came already this way.”  but cable said, “first i must go once to my sister again; what will she do come spring and no man on her garden?  she will say ‘weeds are alive from here to the stream of friday; i grieve for my brother’s plowing,’ then break and cry.”  “lose no sleep,” they said, “for that fallow: she will say before summer, ‘i can get me a daylong man, do better than a brother.’ ”  cable said, “i think of my wife: dearly she needs consoling; i must go back for a little for fear she die of grieving.”  “cable,” they said, “john cable, ask no such wild favor; still, if you fear she die soon, the boat might wait for her.”  but cable said, “i remember: out of charity let me go shore up my poorly mother, cries all afternoon.”  they said, “she is old and far, far and rheumy with years, and, if you like, we shall take no note of her tears.”  but cable said, “i am neither your hired man nor maid, your dog nor shadow nor your ape to be led.”  he said, “i must go back: once i heard someone say that the hollow stream of friday is a rank place to lie;  and this word, now i remember, makes me sorry: have you thought of my own body i was always good to?  the frame that was my devotion and my blessing was, the straight bole whose limbs were long as stories—  now, poor thing, left in the dirt by the stream of friday might not remember me half tenderly.”  they let him nurse no worry; they said, “we give you our word: poor thing is made of patience; will not say a word.”  “cable, friend john, john cable,” after this they said, “come with no company to the far side.  to a populous place, a dense city that shall not be changed before much sorrow dry.”  over shaking water toward the feet of his father, leaving the hills’ color and his poorly mother  and his wife at grieving and his sister’s fallow and his body lying in the rank hollow,  now cable is carried on the dark river; nor even a shadow followed him over.  on the wide river gray as the sea flags of white water are his company.

 september 14, 1915 it's how she spreads, without a sound, her scent of orange blossom on the dark of me, it is the way she shrouds in mourning black her mother-of-pearl and ivory, the way she wears the lace ruff at her throat, and how she turns her face, quite voiceless, self-possessed, because she takes the language straight to heart, is thrifty with the words she speaks. it's how she is so reticent yet welcoming when she comes out to face my panegyrics, the way she says my name mocking and mimicking, makes gentle fun, yet she's aware that my unspoken drama is really of the heart, though a little silly; it's how, when night is deep and at its darkest, we linger after dinner, vaguely talking and her laughing smile grows fainter and then falls gently on the tablecloth; it's the teasing way she won't give me her arm and then allows deep feeling to come with us when we walk out, promenading on the hot colonial boulevard. . .  because of this, your sighing, modest style of love, i worship you, my faithful star who like to cloud yourself about in mourning, generous, hidden blossom; kindly mellowness who have presided over my thirty years with the self-denying singleness a vase has, whose half-blown roses wreathe with scent the headboard of a convalescent man; cautious nurse, shy serving maid, dear friend who trembles with the trembling of a child when you revise the reading that we share; apprehensive, always timid guest at the feast i give; my ally, humble dove that coos when it is morning in a minor key, a key that's wholly yours.  may you be blessed, modest, magnificent; you have possessed the highest summit of my heart, you who are at once the artist of lowly and most lofty things, who bear in your hands my life as if it was your work of art!  o star and orange blossom, may you dwindle gently rocked in an unwedded peace, and may you fade out like a morning star which the lightening greenness of a meadow darkens or like a flower that finds transfiguration on the blue west, as it might on a simple bed.

 stunned heat of noon. in shade, tan, silken cows hide in the thorned acacias. a butterfly staggers.  stamping their hooves from thirst, small horses drowse or whinny for water. on parched, ochre headlands, daggers  of agave bristle in primordial defense, like a cornered monster backed up against the sea.  a mongoose charges dry grass and fades through a fence faster than an afterthought. dust rises easily.  haze of the harmattan, sahara dust, memory’s haze from the dried well of africa, the headland’s desert  or riders in swirling burnooses, mixed with the greys of hills veiled in impressionist light. we inherit  two worlds of associations, or references, drought that we heighten into delacroix’s north africa,  veils, daggers, lances, herds the harmattan brought with a phantom inheritance, which the desperate seeker  of a well-spring staggers in the heat in search of— heroic ancestors; the other that the dry season brings  is the gust of a european calendar, but it is the one love that thirsts for confirmations in the circling rings  of the ground dove’s cooing on stones, in the acacia’s thorns and the agave’s daggers, that they are all ours,  the white horsemen of the sahara, india’s and asia’s plumed mongoose and crested palmtree, benin and pontoise.  we are history’s afterthought, as the mongoose races ahead of its time; in drought we discover our shadows,  our origins that range from the most disparate places, from the dugouts of guinea to the nile’s canted dhows.   ii  the incredible blue with its bird-inviting cloud, in which there are crumbling towers, banners and domes,  and the sliding carthage of sunsets, the marble shroud drawn over associations that are greece’s and rome’s  and rarely of africa. they continue at sixty-seven to echo in the corridors of the head, perspectives  of a corridor in the vatican that led, not to heaven, but to more paintings of heaven, ideas in lifted sieves  drained by satiety because great art can exhaust us, and even the steadiest faith can be clogged by excess,  the self-assured christs, the madonnas’ inflexible postures without the mess of motherhood. with this blue i bless  emptiness where these hills are barren of tributes and the repetitions of power, our sky’s naive  ceiling without domes and spires, an earth whose roots like the thorned acacia’s deepen my belief.  
NEW POEM
 i wake to the sound of water, and think, "mother has died and gone to france," she is at un autre hôtel , speaking french better than ever, while i stare at the fog that has a river in it—the broad dordogne, making its river noise, as if all the faucets have been left on all night. the river rushing in one direction only, so different from blackfish creek, where the sea floods in and back, scrubbing the sand both ways.  well, one travels so things are different. american actors speak french on tv here. last night they showed accident catastrophe  about two babies switched in the hospital at birth. one dies. the parents discover the dead child was someone else's and their child is alive in florida with son père , though sa mère  est morte de some disease, who knows?  anyway, ed asner, who plays the lawyer, speaks gravelly french, but people have an american demeanor, they pull their hair on the edge of violence. then each family gives up a piece, and the child ends up more loved than ever, as if it's inevitable. or so the river is telling me with its one-way simplicity, like gravity. "alive in the eternal heart of france"—that's mother i'm thinking about, for some reason,  maybe the journal my wife's been keeping, so like the daily letters mother wrote to sa mère et son père , when her life was flowing through her like the broad dordogne. and where is she now? does she wish my father were with her, one of him alive, and one with her? a bell is ringing wildly, each of its peals like a round boat rolling downstream where the river divides around an island only to sweep back into itself somewhere in the fog.

NEW POEM
 sometimes up out of this land a legend begins to move. is it a coming near of something under love?  love is of the earth only, the surface, a map of roads leading wherever go miles or little bushes nod.  not so the legend under, fixed, inexorable, deep as the darkest mine the thick rocks won't tell.  as fire burns the leaf and out of the green appears the vein in the center line and the legend veins under there,  so, the world happens twice— once what we see it as; second it legends itself deep, the way it is.

 of many reasons i love you here is one  the way you write me from the gate at the airport so i can tell you everything will be alright  so you can tell me there is a bird trapped in the terminal      all the people ignoring it       because they do not know what to do with it       except to leave it alone until it scares itself to death  it makes you terribly terribly sad  you wish you could take the bird outside and set it free or       (failing that) call a bird-understander to come help the bird  all you can do is notice the bird and feel for the bird       and write to tell me how language feels impossibly useless  but you are wrong  you are a bird-understander better than i could ever be who make so many noises and call them song  these are your own words your way of noticing and saying plainly of not turning away from hurt  you have offered them to me       i am only giving them back  if only i could show you how very useless they are not

 my heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a water'd shoot; my heart is like an apple-tree whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit; my heart is like a rainbow shell that paddles in a halcyon sea; my heart is gladder than all these because my love is come to me.  raise me a dais of silk and down; hang it with vair and purple dyes; carve it in doves and pomegranates, and peacocks with a hundred eyes; work it in gold and silver grapes, in leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys; because the birthday of my life is come, my love is come to me.  
NEW POEM
 i hate the word, and i guess that’s why it is said? people love to hurt one another. it is what makes us human. i do love dogs. they don’t seem to be evil unless humans make them that way. dogs can maul and they can sniff out bombs. they’ll get as close to you as they can while you’re sleeping. they’ll share heat and scent in the crook of your knees. is there really a thing such as innocence? i have desired from birth to live. daily, i wrestle the tight arms of guilt. at the shelter, the adoption coach told us that our new dog was highly food motivated. i have been called a bitch. our dog trembles when he’s afraid and the only thing we can do is wait for the fear to leave. there’s no comforting him. in a dream they held me down, scrawled bitch across my chest in old embers. they covered my head as a weapon was raised. i had a dog who once kept me from walking into the arroyo. she blocked my path and wouldn’t move. i’ll never know what, or who, she saved me from.  
NEW POEM
 dear love, where the red lillies blossomed and grew, the white snows are falling; and all through the wood, where i wandered with you, the loud winds are calling; and the robin that piped to us tune upon tune, neath the elm—you remember, over tree-top and mountain has followed the june, and left us—december.  has left, like a friend that is true in the sun, and false in the shadows. he has found new delights, in the land where he's gone, greener woodlands and meadows. what care we? let him go! let the snow shroud the lea, let it drift on the heather! we can sing through it all; i have you—you have me, and we’ll laugh at the weather.  the old year may die, and a new one be born that is bleaker and colder; but it cannot dismay us; we dare it—we scorn, for love makes us bolder. ah robin! sing loud on the far-distant lea, thou friend in fair weather; but here is a song sung, that’s fuller of glee, by two warm hearts together.  
NEW POEM
 half  awake, i was imagining a friend’s young lover, her ash blonde hair, the smooth taut skin of  twenty. i imagined her short legs and dimpled knees. the door scraped open, but eyes closed, i saw nothing. the mattress sagged. she laid her head on my chest, and murmured love against my throat, almost humming, approaching song, so palpable i could hold her only chastely, if  this was chaste. i couldn’t move my hand even to caress her freckled shoulder. so this is how imagination works, i thought, sadly. and when at last she spoke, she spoke with the amused voice of my wife, my wife who was at work but also here, pleased at the confusion she was causing. this is a lesson about flesh, isn’t it? i asked.blowfly, she whispered on my throat as we made tense, pensive love.blowfly, blowfly.  
NEW POEM
 blue light ringing through the green grass.  the bent heads of petals  are not praying to anything or to anyone.  only we are standing in a field of them,  my son and me and me holding him.  in my arms he stretches out to the very far ends of the earth  like a radio signal  made of skin and organs, of everything.  i was singing a song to him i made up  about me dying. since yesterday he has not been  crying as much as screaming like it is terrifying  to wake up.  it is terrifying to wake up and terrifying to sleep  and his feet going blue in the cold spring air  in which he is growing. his mother is growing him  with the milk she makes all day, spilling out in blue.  the song i am singing to him puts him to sleep,  will put me to sleep.  will one day burst the drum in my ear  like a bell, very much like a voice screaming from far off,  though you don’t know if it’s hurting or hungry or nothing at all.  
NEW POEM
 in my seeing there was a blank and he filled that blank with words, there were words for darkness which made it lift, there were words for cover which ripped them off, there were legs that crossed and hearts that crossed, promises red and read, and the pluck of banjo had a name for that twang, and the way he called the world into notice, that had a word, too. once i saw i couldn’t unsee and the worst was that the light glaring from the letters left blue haze under my eyelids. there are no photographs of this time, and i can only go by what others tell me: i was blurred and erratic, i drew a circle of white chalk around me and called myself inviolate, i watched for horses on the horizon, my walls were under siege from smaller men who called themselves heroes. they say i reached over the balustrade and picked up the tiny ships and threw them over the edge of the world. i tore my hair, cut one breast from my body and plattered it as around my fortifications one man pulled another man behind his chariot. if they say that’s how i was, that’s how i was. i have no words for the one in the mirror who apes me every morning. she’s not the one i remember imagining as a young girl. there must be a way to unsee how i tap the glass and she taps back, and which wall, which cassandra weeping—everything i saw i spoke to his ear, and the wall crashed into place between us, the horse had a bellyful of it, the blank was full of small soldiers, and he turned from my beauty and said my name.

 where we could be boys together. this region of want: the campestrial flat. the adolescents roving across the plat. come hither. he-of-the-hard would call me hither.  sheer abdomen, sheer slickensides, the feldspar buttes that mammillate the valley right where it needs to bust.  and i could kiss his tits and he could destroy me on the inflorescent slopes; in his darkest dingles; upon the grassland’s raffish plaits. and he could roll me in coyote brush: i who was banished to the barren could come back into his fold, and i would let him lay me down on the cold, cold ground.  clouds, above, lenticular, the spreading fundament, a glorious breech among the thunderheads and in their midst, a great white heron magnifies the day. we’d keep together, he and i, and we’d gain meaning from our boyage; we’d pursue each other through the crush of darkling rifts. climb into each other’s precipitous coombes.  where would it end, this brush and bush, this brome and blazing star? there is always some new way to flex a limb and find its secret drupe.  not only the hope of nature; the nature of hope:  so long as culverts carry us, so long as we stay ripe to one another’s lips, and welcoming to hands, as long as we extend our spans, to tangle them, as spinning insects do their glistered floss.  this is not a time to think the trumpet vine is sullen. rather: the trumpet’s bell is but a prelude. it says we all are beautiful at least once. and, if you’d watch over me, we can be beautiful again.

 in memory, 1929-2004 we choose a cheap hotel because they’re serving drinks. we drink. i hear him tell a tale or two: he thinks  that so-and-so’s a sleaze; and then there was the time that milosz phoned, oh please. another gin with lime?  i want to say that once, i saw him dressed in leather, leaning on a fence inside a bar. rather,  walking to the n, i gush about his books; he gives his change to men who’ve lost their homes and looks:  how like him, i’ve been told. our day together done, i hug him in the cold. and then the train is gone.

 i regard your affections, find your teeth have left me a bruise necklace. those lipstick marks leech a trail, ear to ear, facsimile your smile. your 40 ounces of malt liquor, your shrink hate, your eyes dialing 911. the hearts you draw with ballpoint on my cigarette packs when i've left the room, penned in your girl's  cursive, look demented, misshapen approximations of what i refuse to hand over. it's a nice touch, though: a little love to accompany the cancer. my thought follows you to where you spend your days lying in bed, smoking and reading the beats. the accumulation of clothes and ashes circles you, rising like a moat after rainfall.  often you are a study in detachment—the trigger eye is your eye, still as a finger poised to press should one refuse to cooperate, and i wonder how you can hate men so much when you think like one. think of what i could be doing outside if i could unlock the door of myself: think bikini, think soda fountain, think tradition, a day lacking  entirely your brand of ambivalence. if you were a number, i'd subtract you; if you were a sentence, i'd rewrite you. are you the one who left these wilted flowers, are you the one whose pin spells out h-o-l-e? why are you wearing my clothes? if you are weather, then i am a town, closing down at word of your coming: you're a glacier on fast  forward, you're direct as a detour, when i say good-bye you move in next door. you say you want to have my baby, you want to buy me a car, and you're too young to enter a bar. i should tether you to a tree in the dark park, allow the moon to stroke your white neck. i should give you a diamond collar, walk you around the block and show you off.

 small wonder he’s not been sighted all winter; this old brock’s been to normandy and back  through the tunnels and trenches of his subconscious. his father fell victim to mustard-gas at the somme;  one of his sons lost a paw to a gin-trap at lisbellaw: another drills on the antrim hills’  still-molten lava in a moth-eaten balaclava. an elaborate system of foxholes and duckboards  leads to the terminal moraine of an ex-linen baron’s croquet-lawn where he’s part-time groundsman.  i would find it somewhat infra dig to dismiss him simply as a pig or heed gerald of wales’ tall tales  of badgers keeping badger-slaves. for when he shuffles across the esker i glimpse my grandfather’s whiskers  stained with tobacco-pollen. when he piddles against a bullaun i know he carries bovine tb but what i see  is my father in his sunday suit’s bespoke lime and lignite, patrolling his now-diminished estate and taking stock of this and that.

 i’ve never seen the land of milk and honey, but at  the iowa state fair i glimpsed a cow fashioned of butter.  it lived behind a window in an icy room, beneath klieg lights.  i filed past as one files past a casket at a wake.  it was that sad: a butter cow without a butter calf. nearby i spied  a butter motorcycle, motorcycle- sized, a mechanical afterthought  i thought the cow might have liked to ride. you don’t drive a motorcycle; you ride it.  but not if you’re a butter cow, not if you’re a butter cow who’s seen, if  not the land of milk and honey, the land of milk, and dwelled within it.  it had a short life span, the butter cow. before it died, i looked  deep into its butter eyes. it saw my butter soul. i could  have wept, or spread myself, for nobody, across dry toast.

 they had questioned him for hours. who exactly was he? and when he told them, they questioned him again. when they accepted who he was, as someone not involved, they pulled out his fingernails. then they took him to a waste-ground somewhere near the horseshoe bend, and told him what he was. they shot him nine times.  a dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres. the bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself. broken glass and knotted durex. the knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking. i used to see him in the gladstone bar, drawing pints for strangers, his almost perfect fingers flecked with scum.

 how to get to it: the heart within the corset made of whalebone and parisian leaded satin, winter weight.  i can barely breathe.  sun filters from high windows into this dark-paneled room  where my sister helps me step into the skirt, our grandmother’s grandmother’s sent-for dress, its pinprick satin buttons down my chest. we hook each hook to hold the corset flush, to anchor the bustle, as she did for her quiet february wedding, snow covering the steeple of the seamen’s bethel.  melville:this, shipmates, is that other lesson:  fasten the locks, hold the heart within its watery chamber. when the seamstress slid the bone into the bodice and pinned each cut piece together, the satin stood upright at the sewing table. she could almost see it breathe.  i am swallowed and swallowed whole. it outlasts all our vows.

 for marian before you, i was living on an island and all around the seas of that lonely coast cast up their imitation jewels, cast their fables and enigmas, questioning, sly. i never solved them, or ever even heard, being perfect in innocence: unconscious of self; such ignorance of history was all my wealth— a geographer sleeping in the shadow of virgins.  but though my maps were made of private countries i was a foreigner in all of them after you had come, for when you spoke, it was with a human tongue and never understood by my land-locked gentry. then did the sun shake down a million bells and birds bloom on bough in wildest song! phlegmatic hills went shivering with flame; the chestnut trees were manic at their deepest boles!  it is little strange that nature was riven in her frame at this second creation, known to every lover— how we are shaped and shape ourselves in the desires of the other within the tolerance of human change. out of the spring’s innocence this revolution, created on a kiss, announced the second season, the summer of private history, of growth, through whose sweet sessions the trees lift toward the sun, each leaf a revelation.  our bodies, coupled in the moonlight’s album, proclaimed our love against the outlaw times whose signature was written in the burning towns. your face against the night was my medallion. your coming forth aroused unlikely trumpets in the once-tame heart. they heralded your worth who are my lodestar, my bright and ultimate north, marrying all points of my personal compass.  this is the love that now invents my fear which nuzzles me like a puppy each violent day. it is poor comfort that the mind comes, saying: what is one slim girl to the peoples’ wars? still, my dice are loaded: having had such luck, having your love, my life would still be whole though i should die tomorrow. i have lived it all. —and love is never love, that cannot give love up.

 pei designed the building with views, smooth masonry, and the mountains aligned for a photo opportunity; inside are files sufficient for forever, for fine tuning weather.  great spangled fritillary, the watcher vaguely recalls from teach yourself lepidoptery, a book. he wanted to live in a land of appropriate weather with views of mountains and with music constant.  he wants to tell a story but no one would listen, like opera: black women clean the floors and shine the walls like silver nightly. computers whir platonic as nuns. nothing  escapes naming; storms arranged in teacups like anyone’s collection, like rows of butterflies pinned and satisfactory: this is the new landscape. or there is a lewd father among the shrubbery  watching daughters in weather; he breathes heavily and the wet wisdom begins, the storm gathering to spill across the ridge, longed for. daughters must be warned against sincerity  of frantic violins: “he was a man of sympathetic tendencies,” read the official report. “he was smaller than he looked and tended to lick chocolate from his fingers in a lascivious manner.”  he tried his wife’s patience, it is true, and lived alone through the marriage, kept his own counsel. with such petty symbols as weather, he kept his own counsel.  a butterfly like weather; the climate like laughter, the movement of small air. clouds, too, have names. clouds leave home to find themselves. good money after bad, the fathers say, and close  the door called nature against their coming back. the funny little ways children have of making the world the color they always wanted. sunset. birds. the mathematics of memory begin  to swirl like cookie dough, like chocolate with egg and sugar and vanilla and butter. a bowl to lick, dangerous with delight, as ultraviolet. home again! begs the mother and soon the sorry child walks  that long allée as rain begins to pour.   past such petty symbols the boy returns through architecture, a silly gauntlet: the butterfly, the mother, the fit signatures of loveliness. his parents at the door,  the little cottage in the woods, hansel home again at last, the shining path. a little like a dream. ours is not a simple age, and things are what they seem happily ever after in the malicious tiny rain.

NEW POEM
 allegiance is assigned forever when the mind chooses and stamps the will. thus, i must love you still through good and ill.  but though we cannot part we may retract the heart and build such privacies as self-regard agrees conduce to ease.  so manners will repair the ravage of despair which generous love invites, preferring quiet nights to vain delights.

 i’m a pipe cleaner. a drop of moisture on the big nose. a pushing landscape, indecipherable.  you speak of a very good sort of englishness.  that world could stand as a mallet. a one-body god with penis or not.  i want only to admire the grass. the great locks of trees. that the idea is enough.  my bringing herbs to myself  thyself. my life  hits my ears. a shredded pinky stream of bass and corrugated paper.  who is it that actually sees herself? the heart center of the fragrance billowing toward its end.  my mother crammed in her room next to her mother. she was obedient. she was the method and voted for the wrong person.  our sore throats were our throats. we said to ourselves in our clay structures  we are the motherboards.  we’ll pull the blue ox back into our barn where the three kings still kneel.  we cleaned the stable. we pushed the brush over the beautiful animals.

 in memoriam m.k.h., 1911-1984 she taught me what her uncle once taught her: how easily the biggest coal block split if you got the grain and hammer angled right.  the sound of that relaxed alluring blow, its co-opted and obliterated echo, taught me to hit, taught me to loosen,  taught me between the hammer and the block to face the music. teach me now to listen, to strike it rich behind the linear black.  1 a cobble thrown a hundred years ago keeps coming at me, the first stone aimed at a great-grandmother's turncoat brow. the pony jerks and the riot's on. she's crouched low in the trap running the gauntlet that first sunday down the brae to mass at a panicked gallop. he whips on through the town to cries of 'lundy!'  call her 'the convert'. 'the exogamous bride'. anyhow, it is a genre piece inherited on my mother's side and mine to dispose with now she's gone. instead of silver and victorian lace, the exonerating, exonerated stone.  2 polished linoleum shone there. brass taps shone. the china cups were very white and big— an unchipped set with sugar bowl and jug. the kettle whistled. sandwich and tea scone were present and correct. in case it run, the butter must be kept out of the sun. and don't be dropping crumbs. don't tilt your chair. don't reach. don't point. don't make noise when you stir.  it is number 5, new row, land of the dead, where grandfather is rising from his place with spectacles pushed back on a clean bald head to welcome a bewildered homing daughter before she even knocks. 'what's this? what's this?' and they sit down in the shining room together.  3 when all the others were away at mass i was all hers as we peeled potatoes. they broke the silence, let fall one by one like solder weeping off the soldering iron: cold comforts set between us, things to share gleaming in a bucket of clean water. and again let fall. little pleasant splashes from each other's work would bring us to our senses.  so while the parish priest at her bedside went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying and some were responding and some crying i remembered her head bent towards my head, her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives— never closer the whole rest of our lives.  4 fear of affectation made her affect inadequacy whenever it came to pronouncing words 'beyond her'.bertold brek. she'd manage something hampered and askew every time, as if she might betray the hampered and inadequate by too well-adjusted a vocabulary. with more challenge than pride, she'd tell me, 'you know all them things.' so i governed my tongue in front of her, a genuinely well- adjusted adequate betrayal of what i knew better. i'd naw and aye and decently relapse into the wrong grammar which kept us allied and at bay.  5 the cool that came off sheets just off the line made me think the damp must still be in them but when i took my corners of the linen and pulled against her, first straight down the hem and then diagonally, then flapped and shook the fabric like a sail in a cross-wind, they made a dried-out undulating thwack. so we'd stretch and fold and end up hand to hand for a split second as if nothing had happened for nothing had that had not always happened beforehand, day by day, just touch and go, coming close again by holding back in moves where i was x and she was o inscribed in sheets she'd sewn from ripped-out flour sacks.  6 in the first flush of the easter holidays the ceremonies during holy week were highpoints of our sons and lovers phase. the midnight fire. the paschal candlestick. elbow to elbow, glad to be kneeling next to each other up there near the front of the packed church, we would follow the text and rubrics for the blessing of the font. as the hind longs for the streams, so my soul. . . dippings. towellings. the water breathed on. the water mixed with chrism and with oil. cruet tinkle. formal incensation and the psalmist's outcry taken up with pride: day and night my tears have been my bread.  7 in the last minutes he said more to her almost than in all their life together. 'you'll be in new row on monday night and i'll come up for you and you'll be glad when i walk in the door . . . isn't that right?' his head was bent down to her propped-up head. she could not hear but we were overjoyed. he called her good and girl. then she was dead, the searching for a pulsebeat was abandoned and we all knew one thing by being there. the space we stood around had been emptied into us to keep, it penetrated clearances that suddenly stood open. high cries were felled and a pure change happened.  8 i thought of walking round and round a space utterly empty, utterly a source where the decked chestnut tree had lost its place in our front hedge above the wallflowers. the white chips jumped and jumped and skited high. i heard the hatchet's differentiated accurate cut, the crack, the sigh and collapse of what luxuriated through the shocked tips and wreckage of it all. deep-planted and long gone, my coeval chestnut from a jam jar in a hole, its heft and hush become a bright nowhere, a soul ramifying and forever silent, beyond silence listened for.

 purple as tulips in may, mauve into lush velvet, purple as the stain blackberries leave on the lips, on the hands, the purple of ripe grapes sunlit and warm as flesh.  every day i will give you a color, like a new flower in a bud vase on your desk. every day i will paint you, as women color each other with henna on hands and on feet.  red as henna, as cinnamon, as coals after the fire is banked, the cardinal in the feeder, the roses tumbling on the arbor their weight bending the wood the red of the syrup i make from petals.  orange as the perfumed fruit hanging their globes on the glossy tree, orange as pumpkins in the field, orange as butterflyweed and the monarchs who come to eat it, orange as my cat running lithe through the high grass.  yellow as a goat’s wise and wicked eyes, yellow as a hill of daffodils, yellow as dandelions by the highway, yellow as butter and egg yolks, yellow as a school bus stopping you, yellow as a slicker in a downpour.  here is my bouquet, here is a sing song of all the things you make me think of, here is oblique praise for the height and depth of you and the width too. here is my box of new crayons at your feet.  green as mint jelly, green as a frog on a lily pad twanging, the green of cos lettuce upright about to bolt into opulent towers, green as grand chartreuse in a clear glass, green as wine bottles.  blue as cornflowers, delphiniums, bachelors’ buttons. blue as roquefort, blue as saga. blue as still water. blue as the eyes of a siamese cat. blue as shadows on new snow, as a spring azure sipping from a puddle on the blacktop.  cobalt as the midnight sky when day has gone without a trace and we lie in each other’s arms eyes shut and fingers open and all the colors of the world pass through our bodies like strings of fire.

 sent in after new ground was taken, my father ducked from ditch to shell-hole, unwinding the telephone cable behind him, a pfc. cast as mercury, connecting the gods with the lesser gods.  funny to think of him trailing the complex filament of speech, that man, neither shy nor sullen, who answered only “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” and never volunteered a private thought.  standing off with his hands in his pockets or cupping a cigarette, he seemed to be waiting with the great rural patience of fields for whatever might rise pure and nameless or fall from the sky beyond explanation.  if anyone asked what he was thinking, he said, “nothing,” and when he died he rushed out leaving everything unsaid, uncoiling a dark line into darkness down which a familiar silence roars.

 you can never tell by the looks of a frog how high it can leap, said her auntie ott. haley's hair flips up and down as she moves in her hard shoes, her leather coat for winter is lengthy and sways, some stains mottling the bottom—  elegant windows in decline that at one time one could climb through, french imitation nailed shut for decades. in shadow pigeons peck in dirty snow massed against the closest wall. what her hair will look like someday, she surmises. but otherwise isn't troubled by the future. don't walk like a duck, men don't like it, said auntie ott. not necessarily, responded her grandmother, as she brushed a crumb onto a saucer— playing cards, stories of earlier poverty. as a girl she pretended to be as worried as they whether bobby would be drafted and killed in the war. maybe she's important in art or decoration, supposes the student adjusting his pack— as the light changes, he steps out but she banks around the corner behind him, purseless, gloveless, passing a restaurant, a coin store, a key shop—owners staring over the street wishing they were younger. or lived in an earlier time. which is partly the fault of late winter. clittering ice in trees of veteran's park. . . lightly swinging her arms now, heading uphill, growing distant, like a figure studied in auntie ott's utrillo print— stick-like, scarecrow-like— to her right, a converted house looking vaguely like a shrunken monticello. . . cream-colored barriers of plowed snow as sun sprays more volume. . . a moment of deception  there's not much that can be done, said the city, when the oaks were removed for curb repair. the dome fell off the theatre. a policeman peering east, frozen. just as the museum is shuttered next to the blank bowling alley (which is our other perspective). haley has never felt trapped, though the possibilities, occasionally, have skirted about like sparrows. a jet crosses the sky. followed by its vibration. what she found sustaining she learned in college. where she goes is no one's business either. neither is she worshipped and adored—auntie ott would be dismayed. though not entirely

 a heave of afternoon light pulls a tulip from the turf, a bower for locusts, a cup of shells. the farmhouse tilts, a bent shadow on wheels. in cedar rooms a family is molded, silent, wrapped in the wire of steel eyes and stopped voice, romantic ash. this is not my house, my ghost, my uninvited guest, my lost labor of love, my thicket or grease, my jpeg gessoed or rawhide suit. the yellow light throbs like an internal organ — soft body of an overture to insect sounds — sapling of a new world — whose future awaits me at the tilting window of my own domestic hut. perhaps this is my mesh of hours, my muscular ache, my guardian sash, twist of rope carved around an old maple trunk, my rod of power red with anticipatory friction at the edge of an emerging set of planetary rings. stained ochre by the air i pitch forward, a vanilla-scented pear that floats or falls. in the rattan chair on the front porch by the blistered boards of the front door a figure of tar watches. cool dust sparkles and settles. shadows have made me visible. an empty wagon flares on the hillside.

 tend their yard every weekend, when they paint or straighten the purple fencepickets canting each other at the edge of their lot,  hammering them down into soil to stand. how long will they stay put? my neighbors mend their gate, hinges rusted to blood-colored dust,  then weave gold party-lights with orange lobster-nets &amp; blue buoys along the planks. so much to see &amp; not see again, each chore undone  before they know it. i love how faithfully they work their garden all year, scumbling dried eelgrass in fall, raking away mulch in spring.  today the older one, pat, plants weeds ripped from a cranberry-bog. sassafras &amp; pickerel, black locust &amp; meadowsweet, wild sarsaparilla,  checkerberry, starflower. will they take root here? meanwhile chris waters seeds sown months ago. furrows of kale, snap-bean, scallion break  the surface, greedy for life. muskrose &amp; lilac cast their last shadows. is it seeing or sun that makes them flicker, as if they’ve vanished? they shake  like a letter in someone’s hand. here come the guys from whorfs (“whores”) court, walking their dog —also in drag—to the dunes.  i miss seeing disorient express (a.k.a. cheng, out of drag) walk by, in tulle &amp; sequins the exact shade of bok choi. he must have endured  things no one can name, to name only ks, pneumocystis, aplastic anemia. i remember he walked off his gurney when the ambulance came, then broke  his nurse’s fingers in the hospital when he tried to change his iv line, wanting to live without meds. zorivax, ativan, leucovorin? i don't know.  pat &amp; chris pack down the loose dirt. i’ll never know what threads hold our lives together. they kiss, then fall on the grass. i should look away but don’t.

 d always felt, somehow or other, double. he was an upright line, but then again, he was a curve. when he looked in the mirror straight on, he saw the dapper features of the diplomat he was. but sideways, if he took off his horn-rimmed glasses, he imagined he could be taken for a rather distinguished dame. he always saw both sides to everything. would he ever find his dæmon—the divine spirit within? did he really have one spirit? d seemed to be singing a duet with himself. seeing both sides made him a champion procrastinator. d dilly-dallied. waited till the last minute to decide anything. at every posting, he drove the staff crazy. but that was diplomacy. now dusk dropped on the gated embassy grounds. d flipped on his desk lamp, and the pool of light shut out the trees, looming and dissolving. d drew the drapes, deaf to the delicate drone of insect wings. he returned to his desk, trying to distract himself from a strange little pain that had come to him all his life, like a recurrent dream. (except, he had to confess, he never dreamed.) the pain was a distinct tiny stab in a spot, well, what would you call that? d called it down there. for years, since he was a little d, he considered all the options about this strange pain. it was nothing, really. he went long times between feeling it. maybe it was too slight to worry about, but then again . . . at last d decided to see a doctor. as a matter of fact, he saw a number. “tell me your dreams,” the first doctor said. “don't bother to ask me, i never dream,” d said. “in dreams begin responsibilities,” the doctor quoted. d demanded a referral. “i've got a very specific pain,” he said to the next doctor. he pointed to, well, down there. “your testicle,” the physician said. which required a test. several. and more. finally the second doctor read all the results and announced, “aha, a dermoid cyst.” what? inside the cyst were hair follicles and an eye-type thing with eyelashes and a tooth. “do you think i was a twin?” d wondered with a weird kind of delight as he examined the x-ray. well, the doctor wouldn’t go that far. these dermoid cysts were usually removed in childhood. no reason, however, to remove it now. d wouldn’t dream of having it removed! it explained everything! that slightly creepy darling little creature in there must have been a twin, someone d had grown around as she dissolved. d was convinced it was a twin sister. and d had absorbed her. of course he wanted to keep her with him. that very day, he had his first dream. exhausted after his discovery, he had returned to the embassy in the late afternoon. unable to face his office, he diverted his steps from the front walk toward the deserted path on the grounds where no one ever seemed to stroll. he walked deeper into the woods. the path sloped into a shaded dimple in the earth. it was dusk in the dell. d heard the drone of insect wings. in the mottled light a dragonfly dove straight down. up curved a damselfly. impulsively d lay down in the leaves in his three-piece suit and curled up like a praying divine, two hands under his chin. he felt himself melting a little. all the old bedevilments dispersed into a delicate dampness. the world softened from darkling to darling . . .  . . .a stately antlered stag appeared in the distance and slowly, with a calm command, walked closer until d could see that he wore a diamond necklace around his neck. the stag slowly bowed his head, doffed his entire rack of antlers, and raised his head up again, looking directly at d.now the deer was a doe! the doe blinked her eyes at d, as if waking. then she donned the antlers, and turned and walkedaway . . .  d woke up ravenously hungry—and overjoyed. he dusted himself off and drove straight to dinner. as he stared out the restaurant window, eating his dumplings, he wondered if responsibilities really do begin in dreams. maybe dreams are responsible to us, he thought. he felt his sister inside him. she was the reason he was a debonair man, a man who understood that everything has two sides: inner/outer, yes/no. d thought both in lines as sharp as the creases in trousers, and in curves like the swirls of a skirt. what do i really know? he asked himself. only that he had woken strangely endeared to himself—and satisfied. now he understood the necessity of delay. to wait, and then to discover. never to have only one answer. the napkin at the restaurant had come rolled inside a little sparkly ring. “add this to my bill,” he said to the waiter. and pocketed the little diadem as a reminder of the dyad he was.

 hark how the mower damon sung, with love of juliana stung! while everything did seem to paint the scene more fit for his complaint. like her fair eyes the day was fair, but scorching like his am’rous care. sharp like his scythe his sorrow was, and withered like his hopes the grass.  ‘oh what unusual heats are here, which thus our sunburned meadows sear! the grasshopper its pipe gives o’er; and hamstringed frogs can dance no more. but in the brook the green frog wades; and grasshoppers seek out the shades. only the snake, that kept within, now glitters in its second skin.  ‘this heat the sun could never raise, nor dog star so inflame the days. it from an higher beauty grow’th, which burns the fields and mower both: which mads the dog, and makes the sun hotter than his own phaëton. not july causeth these extremes, but juliana’s scorching beams.  ‘tell me where i may pass the fires of the hot day, or hot desires. to what cool cave shall i descend, or to what gelid fountain bend? alas! i look for ease in vain, when remedies themselves complain. no moisture but my tears do rest, nor cold but in her icy breast.  ‘how long wilt thou, fair shepherdess, esteem me, and my presents less? to thee the harmless snake i bring, disarmèd of its teeth and sting; to thee chameleons, changing hue, and oak leaves tipped with honey dew. yet thou, ungrateful, hast not sought nor what they are, nor who them brought.  ‘i am the mower damon, known through all the meadows i have mown. on me the morn her dew distills before her darling daffodils. and, if at noon my toil me heat, the sun himself licks off my sweat. while, going home, the evening sweet in cowslip-water bathes my feet.  ‘what, though the piping shepherd stock the plains with an unnumbered flock, this scythe of mine discovers wide more ground than all his sheep do hide. with this the golden fleece i shear of all these closes every year. and though in wool more poor than they, yet am i richer far in hay.  ‘nor am i so deformed to sight, if in my scythe i lookèd right; in which i see my picture done, as in a crescent moon the sun. the deathless fairies take me oft to lead them in their dances soft: and, when i tune myself to sing, about me they contract their ring.  ‘how happy might i still have mowed, had not love here his thistles sowed! but now i all the day complain, joining my labour to my pain; and with my scythe cut down the grass, yet still my grief is where it was: but, when the iron blunter grows, sighing, i whet my scythe and woes.’  while thus he threw his elbow round, depopulating all the ground, and, with his whistling scythe, does cut each stroke between the earth and root, the edgèd steel by careless chance did into his own ankle glance; and there among the grass fell down, by his own scythe, the mower mown.  ‘alas!’ said he, ‘these hurts are slight to those that die by love’s despite. with shepherd’s-purse, and clown’s-all-heal, the blood i staunch, and wound i seal. only for him no cure is found, whom juliana’s eyes do wound. ’tis death alone that this must do: for death thou art a mower too.’

 the night we got bashed we told rusty how they drove up, yelled queer, threw a hot dog, sped off.  rusty:now, is that gaybashing? or are they just calling you queer? good point.  josey pitied the fools: who buys a perfectly good pack of wieners and drives around san francisco chucking them at gays?  and who speeds off? missing the point, the pleasure of the bash? dear bashers, you should have seen the hot dog hit my neck,  the scarf josey sewed from antique silk kimonos:so gay. you missed laughing at us, us confused, your raw hot dog on the ground.  josey and rusty and bob make fun of the gaybashers, and i wash my scarf in the sink. i use woolite. we worry  about insurance, interest rates. not hot dogs thrown from f-150s, homophobic freaks. after the bashing, we used the atm  in the sex shop next to annie's social club, smiled at the kind owner, his handlebar mustache. astrud gilberto sang tall and tan  and young and lovely, the girl from ipanema... and the dildos gleamed from the walls, a hundred cheerful colors. in san francisco  it rains hot dogs, pity-the-fool. ass-sized penguins, cock after cock in azure acrylic, butterscotch glass, anyone's flesh-tone, chrome.

 a love supreme, a love supreme a love supreme, a love supreme sex fingers toes in the marketplace near your father's church in hamlet, north carolina— witness to this love in this calm fallow of these minds, there is no substitute for pain: genitals gone or going, seed burned out, you tuck the roots in the earth, turn back, and move by river through the swamps, singing:a love supreme, a love supreme; what does it all mean? loss, so great each black woman expects your failure in mute change, the seed gone. you plod up into the electric city— your song now crystal and the blues. you pick up the horn with some will and blow into the freezing night: a love supreme, a love supreme—  dawn comes and you cook up the thick sin 'tween impotence and death, fuel the tenor sax cannibal heart, genitals, and sweat that makes you clean— a love supreme, a love supreme—  why you so black? cause i am why you so funky? cause i am why you so black? cause i am why you so sweet? cause i am why you so black? cause i am a love supreme, a love supreme:

 died june 1916 under your illkempt yellow roses, delia, today you are younger than your son. two and a half decades – the family monument sagged askew, and he overtook your half-a-life. on the other side of the country, near the willows by the slow river, deep in the earth, the white ribs retain the curve of your fervent, careful breast; the fine skull, the ardor of your brain. and in the fingers the memory of chopin études, and in the feet slow waltzes and champagne twosteps sleep. and the white full moon of midsummer, that you watched awake all that last night, watches history fill the deserts and oceans with corpses once again; and looks in the east window at me, as i move past you to middle age and knowledge past your agony and waste.

 where did you get such a dirty face, my darling dirty-faced child?  i got it from crawling along in the dirt and biting two buttons off jeremy’s shirt. i got it from chewing the roots of a rose and digging for clams in the yard with my nose. i got it from peeking into a dark cave and painting myself like a navajo brave. i got it from playing with coal in the bin and signing my name in cement with my chin. i got it from rolling around on the rug and giving the horrible dog a big hug. i got it from finding a lost silver mine and eating sweet blackberries right off the vine. i got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears and from having more fun than you’ve had in years.

 o darling, the moon did not disrobe you. you fell asleep that way, nude and capsized by our wine, our bump  ‘n’ grind shenanigans. blame it on whatever you like; my bed welcomes whomever you decide to be: thug-  mistress, poinsettia, john doe in the alcove of my dreams. you can quote verbatim an entire album  of bone thugs-n-harmony with your ass in the air. there’s nothing wrong with that. they mince syllables  as you call me yours. you don’t like me but still invite me to your home when your homies aren’t near  enough to hear us crash into each other like hours. some men have killed their lovers because they loved them  so much in secret that the secret kept coming out: wife gouging her husband with suspicion, churches sneering  when an usher enters. never mind that. the sickle moon turns the sky into a man’s mouth slapped sideways  to keep him from spilling what no one would understand: you call me god when it gets good though i do not exist to you  outside this room. be yourself or no one else here. your do-rag is camouflage-patterned and stuffed into my mouth.

 ‘dockery was junior to you, wasn’t he?’ said the dean. ‘his son’s here now.’ death-suited, visitant, i nod. ‘and do you keep in touch with—’ or remember how black-gowned, unbreakfasted, and still half-tight we used to stand before that desk, to give ‘our version’ of ‘these incidents last night’? i try the door of where i used to live:  locked. the lawn spreads dazzlingly wide. a known bell chimes. i catch my train, ignored. canal and clouds and colleges subside slowly from view. but dockery, good lord, anyone up today must have been born in ’43, when i was twenty-one. if he was younger, did he get this son at nineteen, twenty? was he that withdrawn  high-collared public-schoolboy, sharing rooms with cartwright who was killed? well, it just shows how much ... how little ... yawning, i suppose i fell asleep, waking at the fumes and furnace-glares of sheffield, where i changed, and ate an awful pie, and walked along the platform to its end to see the ranged joining and parting lines reflect a strong  unhindered moon. to have no son, no wife, no house or land still seemed quite natural. only a numbness registered the shock of finding out how much had gone of life, how widely from the others. dockery, now: only nineteen, he must have taken stock of what he wanted, and been capable of ... no, that’s not the difference: rather, how  convinced he was he should be added to! why did he think adding meant increase? to me it was dilution. where do these innate assumptions come from? not from what we think truest, or most want to do: those warp tight-shut, like doors. they’re more a style our lives bring with them: habit for a while, suddenly they harden into all we’ve got  and how we got it; looked back on, they rear like sand-clouds, thick and close, embodying for dockery a son, for me nothing, nothing with all a son’s harsh patronage. life is first boredom, then fear. whether or not we use it, it goes, and leaves what something hidden from us chose, and age, and then the only end of age.

 a stay of execution: one last day, your day, old everydog, then, as they say, or as we say (a new trick to avoid finalities implicit in destroyed), you have to be put down, or put to sleep— the very dog who, once, would fight to keep from putting down, despite our shouts, a shoe until he gnawed it to the sole, and who would sit up, through our sleepless nights, to bark away some menace looming in the dark.  can you pick up the sense of all this talk? or do you still just listen for a walk, or else, the ultimate reward, a car?— my god, tomorrow's ride . . . well, here we are, right now. you stare at me and wag your tail. i stare back, dog-like, big and dumb. words fail. no more commands, ignore my monologue, go wander off. good dog. you're a good dog. and you could never master, anyway, the execution, as it were, of stay  
NEW POEM
 i used to be a dog. what kind? oh, a mongrel. nothing poncy like the black cocker spaniel called bonzo i had as a child. and certainly not one of those four-footed, aloof snakes that go by the name of greyhound. i remember each and every one of the lice that lived on me. where did i live? in sicily, where the sun shines like a fried egg every day of the year. i had the nose of an angel — i could smell porcini fifty trees away. i knew the man who would start a fight with my master the moment he walked in the bar door. i drank a saucer of red wine every day. i loved eating the butterflies that floated past me — one pounce and they were gone. and they were delicious. better than the bones of a donkey whose meat provided salami for my master and his family. the boy was very good to me — he used to take me down to the sea and let me splash in the waves; then i’d come out onto the sand, barking, and i’d shake all the seawater onto him, wetting his clothes. he loved laughing, and i loved barking. those were the days. i never saw a kennel. my home was an old blanket under a gnarled vine that had been there since dante wrote his only sestina, in homage to the troubadours. the heat was often scorching. the boy found it funny to put a straw hat on my head, one dyed in the colors of the italian flag. i was up early, out scouting for rats to frighten away.  i once peed on a hedgehog to see what it would do. i ran along the clifftop, barking at the wheeling seagulls, and at the fishing boats they flew above. i sometimes ate my master’s leftover spaghetti bolognese in the taverna. my tail would wag like a fan revolving from the ceiling. i was taught party tricks that i’d be asked to do when the grappa was being downed. i’d lie down on the floor and die, to great applause. i’d sit up and beg, to coos and laughter, and i’d be rewarded with a sausage, and those were sausages to swim the adriatic for. i’d sometimes go down to the harbor to look for an attractive gray bitch i liked the smell of. i’d have to fight off other dogs, but i was good at that. i ate one of their ears. once i followed her onto a boat that was heading out to fill up with fish. i had to swim back and i lay on the sand and slept. when i got home my master whipped me. i ran to my blanket, whimpering. i was once brought to a circus, and into the tent of a one-eyed woman with black hair who had a pet parrot. i barked at it, and the parrot expertly returned my bark. i lay on the multi-colored mat and observed the strange bird who observed me. i was glad to leave that tent. i enjoyed hearing the boy play his flute in the evenings. i heard those notes flutter up into the air, and i tried to see them, but never could. i never stopped trying, though. the one thing i couldn’t eat was cheese. the few times i tried it i vomited. on the first occasion that happened i tried to eat it again. if i got the chance now i’d manage it, i’m sure. who would not like to be a dog in the sun? a dog in the sun, like i used to be, long ago. it was an honor.  
NEW POEM
 let us descend into the blind world now. — dante, “the divine comedy”  as above, so below; as below, so above. — three initiates, “the kybalion” a lowcountry marsh trembles with the blood of an african who refused to climb out of the salt and mud of the bay and quite literally lost his head. a hunter named hunter waits for the man’s wounds to close and for him to rise again. some call this festive cruelty paradise. pleasure. demby, the african made to rise and suffer another shot, calls it the afterlife, the unceasing blind world of death he welcomed expecting the end to his captivity and exile. but there is no end to the perfecting of cruelty even now in the afterlife, where a hawk humped up in the high weeds and a house on fire are a congruent sadness, a brief history of nature’s one duty for flesh —decay, decay, decay... sometimes, it is as if every bird in the afterlife trills this one song. and i forget who i am, but then i look down at my feet shuffling in darkness and hear my name — till ... till ... till ... and i know i am no farmer, blade or mule driven over some roach-ragged road to field and fray, and sometimes i forget how i came here to after- life, to pleasure, to domestic violence, to drive, be driven, and then i look down at my hands. it is a war that brought you this peace, a war that brought you this peace.  and then, i heard a question: “shall we kill all of the masters?” and before i brokered an answer, i heard a voice say: “then, we must kill ourselves, first. and who will be left to kill the masters?” i turned to find nothing but a boy in a tree and a girl beside him, their heads tolling in the wind like pecker-fretted fruit. voice, i said, come now or do not come at all. and there, a man i had seen before scratching in dust next to a drill field with a dictionary and a strange astronomy for a face. ezra, is that you, i asked. “the peasants’ bent shoulders, odysseus and the dead bullock — call me whatever you’d like. i come to every name like a white ox toward pisa and the butcher’s road. i come to paradise dragged by the hair ... with one day’s reading and surrendered temple.” you do talk funny, i said. “he do the police in different voices,” he said. and when all the voices sound like the police, i said, kill all the voices. and so ran. i ran from ezra who ran after me and demanded he be my guide. “there is no running from the forest of men. there is no running from men.” i’ll be damned, i said — but before i could finish ezra said, “that’s right. be damned.  be here taloned and tumbling the sky down in paradise. here. be in your cage and free.” but here is not the here i seek nor sought. for that here harangues me and i might as well be the nigger coming over the obstacle fence, a periplum of certain disaster, a choir of empty cups sitting loudly before the famished, your prince, dear ezra, hanging by his heels in the piazza, the sprezzatura of maggots rummaging the round heart for its divinity and pulse. ezra, nothing of you but the dead. and so, i ran past the possum running through the skull holes of a dead man lying in the fog that licked them into a wet testimony, the possum testifying, too, to their death — coming, going, in ruins and floating out, out, beyond their murders and dropped plates, out beyond the thame-ish rivers and its drowning traditions. and then i looked back and saw ezra. he had come to his cage and could go no farther. “till,” he said. “bring me up from beneath these decks, one slaver to another.” he winked and i winked back, handed him the katydid buzzing in my pocket, as i had done before, dug a trench around him as another had done before, then said, “ezra, be here in your cage and free,” and ran.  and then i came upon a mountain and then a chasm for which there was no bridge and so turned back to find a possum running behind me, and i asked him, dear possum, what do we do with this darkness between us, and the possum said nothing and ran on into the darkness, into the chasm and fell speaking of the end of touch, the desire to forget desire, shadows, the fear in a handful of dust, a woman’s mouth, fear i had known of and visited though now i cringed at the thought of that violence, the violence that i brought — and so thought to throw myself, too, in that chasm when a hand touched my shoulder, a voice said, “not now, maybe never. on we go, dear boy, through this weather. let’s find us another theory of light. or darkness.” then, she laughed, for it was a woman with a lit darkness and a careful chin, glasses, her body a tin of tender. what do you know of me, i asked. she said, “louis, i know of you as i know fog — that it comes on through the alleys and past the dead boys and girls who had not wanted to die in those alleys and ornament the city’s sight. louis,” she said. “i’ve known all your light.  but do you know mine?” and i hadn’t, i hadn’t. “i was a taken city burning,” she said, “a burning house built to heal the sick, a sick house full of healing, the owl, moccasin, and panther — a rising for which there has never been such risen, the total black. i is the total black. flame and fox and knot of the what-nots you would have forgotten if not for me, i am perfect fucking memory, no-dominion-defied, the god-head-glitter-gussied-up-for-the-going-down.” and though i thought i saw i had not seen. instead of one body, three. women. and who and who and who, i asked. they laughed at my asking and said, “you wouldn’t know us, but we will tell you our names — mother, song, and holy yoke. audre, gwendolyn, and lucille. follow us. or heel.” and where and where should i follow you? they did not answer, instead, they walked on the edge of the abyss laughing as if the abyss. “we are what is whatnot, the ever shimmying out of the never-wound. louis, do you follow or do you fall,” they said. “are you short or is you tall?”  and on and on they played, pleasured, and pigeoned with each other, kiting sound and word between them as i have seen lovers do, passing cigarettes and smoke from one mouth to another, the smoke the shared body of a god that has no master or mastering plan other than abiding in darkness, abiding in both its coronation and crucifixion. on and on we walked. and i followed. beyond the bears chortling pears from augustine’s outstretched hand, out beyond the river scissoring the changing maple, its leaves ambering then auburn then green each time a child appeared and touched its trunk. we stopped, watched. i asked who are they. and the one full of light and knives answered, waving at a few who journeyed to the edge of the water but did not wade in. and why don’t they wade in, i asked. she snickered, quieted, then said, “wind and foxes, what was never mine but was and was.” as if she knew i did not understand, continued, “‘the ones i got but did not get,’ the wild hair they could not grow but scratches me now as it did once in a dream. our abortions, louis, our ones given and gave. dem.  the ones given all of their years at once. and none or never.” and when she spoke, i saw another come to the shore and wave at me, a boy given and gave, the crushed- color of late evening long after the pickers have come in and settled near a pot of ox bones boiling in the evening of their own water, once again predicting the arch and strange astronomy of the flesh and its march march march to october and the battered soil. i mean i turned from the one waving because i could not be beneath the stairs of his steering and stare. paradise, why do you bring me to such weather? why would any man come down from his noose for this? “because coming down is exactly the point. all heavens lesser and below heaven. noose, not ... you came to see what has become of death ...    ” the women spoke as one who had many tongues — all holy ghost and gut of a river gabbling over the white stones. and where are we going, i asked. “where language begins, till. paradise. but over there.”  •  and wasn’t this paradise that i had entered through the thick marsh waters out of the cane the crowds fleeced of their living flesh at the far bank the intubated children with their gas masks hanging from their hands and wandering the sand in wet hospital gowns in this their new cancer wasn’t this paradise a boy headphoned and heart drunk swaying at the back of the crowd mumbling to himself started from the bottom now we’re here started from the bottom now my whole team is fucking here

 blizzard to lilac. dandelion to leaf. endless variation of seasons i note  in passing, smells i cannot smell: rotting gardens, feces, musk of cat. these two  run in front of me, golden shoulder to patchwork, heads lifted or lowered into  scent, tongues lolling. ears damp with their own spittle and each other's  tell me, tethered a pace behind, their journey's epic: tipping forward to the familiar or stranger's distant yap; angling  to my breathing, whispered praise, my slightest suggestion.  ignored. the shepherd throws herself into  any whirring wheel, to herd the neighbor's tractor mower or the ups truck's packets home; pulling her back,  the golden's oblivious ballast, instinct heading always for the gutter's  deepest puddle, her own way within the forked leash's one-foot range. as we pass,  the clans set up their barking, as if we were news, gathering center  of a congenial warning din—mine answer with disturbances of pace, an extra pull or lollop, grins thrown  slant-eyed over shoulders until one hears a call she can't ignore, surrenders  to baying's ferocious joy moving through muscle and bone. moving storm, storm's eye: happy  universes whirl in their skins as i do in mine. unknowable, their fate. mediums between foreign principalities, they're tied  to me, to each other, by my will, by love; to that other realm by song, and tooth, and blood.

 for emma grace the day we picked our daughter up from camp, goldenrod lined the road, towheaded scouts bowing on both sides, the parting of macadam as we drove, the fields dry, the sky lacy with clouds. a farmer waved.  a horse shrugged its haughty head. we stopped for corn, just picked, and plums and kale, sampled pies, still warm, and tarts and honeyed bread. sheets on a line ballooned out like a ship’s sail. time stopped in those miles before we saw her. for eight days we hadn’t tucked her in or brushed her hair or watched her grow, the week a busy blur of grown-up bliss.  it came anyway, that uprush of fear—because somewhere a child was dead: at a market, a subway, a school, in a lunatic’s bed.

 lie down—lie down!—my noble hound, that joyful bark give o’er; it wakes the lonely echoes round, but rouses me no more— thy lifted ears, thy swelling chest, thy eyes so keenly bright, no longer kindle in my breast the thrill of fierce delight; when following thee on foaming steed my eager soul outstripped thy speed—  lie down—lie down—my faithful hound! and watch this night by me, for thee again the horn shall sound by mountain, stream, and tree; and thou along the forest glade, shall track the flying deer when cold and silent, i am laid in chill oblivion here. another voice shall cheer thee on, and glory when the chase is won.  lie down—lie down!—my gallant hound! thy master’s life is sped; go—couch thee on the dewy ground— ’tis thine to watch the dead. but when the blush of early day is kindling up the sky, then speed thee, faithful friend, away, and to thy mistress hie; and guide her to this lonely spot, though my closed eyes behold her not—  lie down—lie down!—my trusty hound! death comes, and we must part— in my dull ear strange murmurs sound— more faintly throbs my heart; the many twinkling lights of heaven scarce glimmer in the blue— chill round me falls the breath of even, cold on my brow the dew; earth, stars, and heavens, are lost to sight— the chase is o’er!—brave friend, good night!—

 i know i’ll lose her. one of us will decide. linda will say she can’t do this anymore or i’ll say i can’t. confused only about how long to stay, we’ll meet and close it up. she won’t let me hold her. i won’t care that my eyes still work, that i can lift myself past staring. nothing from her will reach me after that. i’ll drive back to them, their low white t-shaped house mine too if i can make them take her place. i’ll have to. i mustn’t think her room and whether if by nine one morning in a year she will have left it, sleepy, late, remembering tomorrow is new york, her interview with un general services a cinch to go well. what i must think instead is bobby’s follow-through from the left side. he pulls my lob past geoff, who’s bored. shagging five soaked balls isn’t geoff’s idea. i tell him he can hit soon. he takes his time, then underhands the first off line and halfway back. ground fog, right field, the freeway, lax. she has both official languages. for the international court, “the registrar shall arrange to have interpreted from french to english and from english into french each statement, question and response.” or maybe it will be washington she’ll work for. on mission to a new west african republic, she might sign on with reynolds, kaiser, bethlehem steel. they needed guinea’s bauxite for aluminum, manganese from gabon, their dealings for more plants and harbors slowed by lengthy phonecalls through paris, when there were snags, she’d fly there that same afternoon, her calendar a mix of eighty hours on and whole weeks off. there’d be sidetrips to england by calais and one aisle over from her on the crossing, by himself, the man i saw this week i fear she’d like. he’d have noticed her before they cleared the dock, she’d been writing something, left wrist bent toward him, the card almost filled, now, with whatever she’d been telling someone else. she’d start another, the address first. eased that he’d sense it in his shoulders when she stood to leave, he’d keep himself from looking, it was much better not to look, he might not interest her, better not to be left remembering how she looked. dover. he’d follow her to the train and sit across from her, apply himself convincingly to his four appointments and their dossiers. after she’d make notes to herself from a bed and breakfast guide, from the guide to the national trust, she’d put the books back in her hemp bag. he didn’t mean to be nosy, he’d say, but was she going to see some country houses while she’s here? comfortably, she’d tell him which ones. though he knew them all, he’d be so taken with her that he’d lose what she was saying, he’d undergo the list and ask if she’d be hiring a car. she’d pick one up tomorrow in hammersmith and then drive west. would she have dinner with him tonight? she’d say she’d like that: she was booked at the st. margaret’s, off russell square, could he meet her there at seven? when she’d close her eyes, her head against the cushioned wing of the seat, he’d think her managing to rest was not so much a carelessness to his attentions as that she wasn’t vain. she wouldn’t catch him watching if he angled his look away from her toward the window, in the tunnels especially he’d see reflected in its glass her gradual full outline as she breathed. there would be time all evening to talk. he’d tell her then about his uncle’s place in surrey where they’d both be welcome, its rubble-stone and leaded casements, tile, an east loggia to the lawns and wooded slope. he’d loved the kitchen garden as a boy, the path there, silver lavender and catmint borders, an oak-doored archway framing for him on chains above a well the twin coronas of roses in the cool damp light.  [...]  our house is a winter rental. each june, we store everything we don’t take with us in the camper to idaho and montana. it’s two full days’ drive with desert much of the way, then farms. only in the last half hour, past ashton, up the hill, are there logging roads and lodgepole, spruce and fir. it agrees with us to be outdoors all summer. i’m shameless about how much i want to fish the broad wadeable meadow streams. the new mayflies can’t lift themselves from the surface film until their wings dry. when i watch them drift down over the slack water, disturbances are rocks sometimes and sometimes fish. linda does needlepoint and crossword puzzles. she keeps checklists of the flowers she finds on her long woodland walks. we do our wash in town and play cards in the hotel lobby. we have time to read. by august, there are berries. a six-pack of grain belt beer is ninety-nine cents. friends have a ranch with acres that stretch back through bottomland to their mountain pasture. the old hodges’ place is vacant. they ask us to stay. in the upstairs bedroom under the cottonwood, it’s almost dark when it clouds up late in the afternoon. we find cancelled checks in the homestead down by the creek. lots are for sale. in our fifth summer there, we buy one. a contractor frames a house for us which i have six weeks to enclose. i want to be, but i’m not good at it, it doesn’t please me at all when my rip-cut splinters the cedar batten, i miss the stud completely with a second nail and i throw things and scream. she can’t stand it when i’m like this. but though she has to leave sometimes and not come back for hours, the work gets done. we drain the pipes, hang shutters, close the place up.  [...]  after five years of saying it, it became a joke with us that we’d have a baby in five years. we’re waiting for the ept. sitting as far away from it as she can and still be home, she wants me to be the one to read it. i’m surprised how glad i am. her not being glad lasts half an hour. she’ll work for the library until she’s due in june. the baby does its tours inside her. when we put the big headphones on her tummy, it seems to hear. her doctor tells her to cut down on salt, her blood pressure’s high. we buy a stethoscope and cuff. she tells linda to quit her job and go to bed. the salt-free cottage cheese is cardboard, but it’s not working, nothing is, i can wait until she’s been resting for an hour before i take it, it doesn’t help. since her diastolic number’s always high, it’s of course high when she sees the doctor: she’ll be in the hospital tomorrow morning if we don’t change doctors tonight. la leche league has two it recommends. the one who calls back asks everything. if she were his wife, he says, he’d want her in the hospital. we’re too frightened to sleep. i hold her. i fall off only when it’s almost light and by then the birds have started. it makes her cry to hear them. when she’s admitted to the ward, they hook an iv up to her that hurts her hand. on the vacant bed next to her, there’s a tray with a syringe and drugs: if she goes into labor she might have convulsions. they tell us on monday that the baby wouldn’t be able to breathe yet on its own, on wednesday that it could suffocate inside her, her placenta’s shutting down. they’ll do another amniocentesis in the morning, they’ll take the baby in the afternoon. she and i are such cases by now that i think they’ll lie, they’ll want to quiet us for the birth by telling us the baby’s lungs are ready, that stranger things have happened in three days. a nurse comes in and says the baby’s lungs are ready, let’s go to prep. since linda can’t have it naturally, it matters all the more to her that she at least be awake. she’ll get to be. both doctors promised me this morning that she’ll have a local, it’s up to them. i get scrubbed. everyone’s in greens. down a corridor, away from me so i won’t hear, the anesthesiologist is talking to her doctors, who are very intent. the scene breaks up. her doctors don’t have to tell me, i know already, i want to hit them, i say i’d promised her because they’d promised, i’d told her she could be awake, that i could be there with her. stop it, you can’t let her see you like this, her pediatrician says. she’s partly sedated. i tell her i’ll be waiting right down the hall. from another room than hers, a baby, a first cry. i have to hear it or not listen too for our baby, linda’s asleep, she can’t. if it’s from her room now that i’m hearing something fainter, someone should tell me soon. i believe the nurse who says “i can’t tell you what it is, but it’s really good.” “how is linda?” “they’re sewing her up now, she’ll be fine.” there’s no reason not to believe her, linda’s not going to die, she’s not going to die or have to hate it that she didn’t, her baby’s all right, we haven’t killed it by not changing doctors. it won’t have to be breathed for by a machine. almost a month early, he’s a wonder to the staff at five pounds ten, he’s linda’s doing, she should be proud of him, she’ll nurse him and she’ll heal. i can buy her now the blue- and white-checked gingham mother and baby rabbit. i can buy her a robe. he comes home with her after the weekend. the two of them feel so hallowed to me that i’m slow to tell it hasn’t worked out for her at all. she writes an essay about it. his having been taken from her early means she failed. bodies are bodies. they know things, they have their own ways. she could have done it if she’d gotten the chance. her doctor didn’t want linda caring how things went. that had to be her job, not linda’s. she’d gone on to say it almost proudly of linda at the last: “this little girl would be fine if she didn’t have a brain.” it’s a long essay. i recognize everything but me. not her antagonist, exactly, i’d been another thing she’d had to worry. whenever i’d taken her blood pressure, she’d felt blamed by me if it was high. each crisis had been hers to deal with by herself. too busy or aloof to find her a better doctor, i’d taught my classes, read, worked on my poem.  [...]  she’s at the mirror. i need to get behind it to the aspirin, do so, close it. “goodness you wake up with a lot of headaches.” “sorry.” “don’t be sorry, i’m sorry for you.” surprised that it turned out like that, and hating her, hating what i’d heard in my own voice, i get out of her way. from the privacy of brooding on it in another room, i hear what she meant: “congratulations. as good as you are at headaches, why settle for so little, why not work up a malignancy of some kind?” and i remember that yesterday, when we were getting in the car, she winced. she’s always twisting her neck or back or something, so i didn’t ask her “did you hurt yourself?” but “did you hurt yourself again?”  [...]  i move the rest of my clothes out of the house. our fights about money pass. in having to leave her, i also have to think again the most forgettable of our outings. over the years, we’d taken our bodies along in company to certain places. in front of me a little to the left, she’d answered “yes” to “two for dinner?” i wasn’t thinking, at the time, how i fit into what she cared about: she fit for me. it comes back to me now because i have to change it, i’d gotten it wrong. normal, expected, there’s a brittle politeness between us when i stop by to pick up owen. below the hem of her flannel housedress, her bare feet.

NEW POEM
 1.  look here, marcus aurelius, we’ve come to see your temple, deluded the guards, crawled through a hole in the fence. why your descendent, my guide and friend  has opted for secrecy, i don’t know. but i do know what to call the africans, passport-less, yellow-eyed who will ride the boat before me for naples, they hope.  here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter storm like a cough, or the seadog drops them at hannibal’s shores, where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants.  what dimension of time will they cross at the hours loop tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists? what siren song will the trucks shipping them back  to ouagadougou drone into their ears? i look at them loitering, waiting for the second act of their darkness to fall. i look at the sky shake her dicey fists.  one can be thankful, i suppose, for not being one of them, and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself to keep the cold wind at bay. but what world is this  that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s rope is about to snap, while the sea and sky ache to become an open-ended road? that’s what we’re all waiting for,  a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit, and let us in on its sweetness as we wait, smoking, or fondling provisions, listening the engine’s invocational purr. in an hour  that will dawn and dusk at once, one that will stretch into days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat, they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star  begins to float on the water, so bright and still, you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand.   2.  a pair of roman fists robbed of spear and shield; the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn  that slipped from the buttery hands, aluminum wrappers smudged with processed cheese;  countless cigarette butts surround the fallen columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam;  pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…  the ruins are not ruined. without all this garbage packed, stratified, how else to name our age?   3.  earlier, i had walked the market of sabratha, changed to its people, but like my old city brought me back to me. the petty merchants, all selling the same goods, shouted out jokes to each other. a sudanese waiter carried a tray with a giant pot of green tea with mint. among the older men,  their heads capped with crimson shennas, i kept seeking my father’s face. an old lust wafted past me when the abaya-clad women, scented with knock-off chanel, sashayed by. the sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries, the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves  with spoons of searing harissa, my mouth watering to a childhood burn. pyramids of local oranges, late season pomegranates, radish and turnip bulbs stacked like billiard balls, and the half carcasses of lambs as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks,  the trays of hearts, kidneys, brains and testicles arrayed in slick arabesques. the hand-woven rugs where the extinct mouflon thrives, mincers, hairdryers, and toasters, their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.  it was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what i saw, my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole. what face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration? i know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled now in comfortable middle age, about the life i left behind.  true, i did envy them the asceticism of their grace, where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walk past the same hills all your life, to eat from the same tree and drink from the well that gave you your name.   4.  though for centuries the locals broke the statues’ limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery, enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:  you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace her against the trunk of an oak. it’s not the moonlight, but refractions from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.  first, god made love: the canopy like the inside of an emerald, her lips a rush of cochineal. then a route of evanescence brought her from carthage into these living arms, here.   5.  “a nice time, “ he tells us, how he and four cousins crossed the desert heading home on top of three-years’ worth of meager pay (the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.  wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hoped to become, he looked at the sky and wondered “what those flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.”  later, deported in a cargo plane, he handed the tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports, and they like “space aliens” (in shabby uniforms, sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.  as the propellers’ hammering calmed to a shuddering hum, he saw the stars, “hundreds of them like gnats” swarm mt. akakous’ peak.  “my next road is the water,” he says serving us tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good, to put him on the next boat to the moon shining over syracuse.   6.  suddenly, i find your descendant’s hands leafing through my chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:  “how is it,” he asks, “that starlight announces the hour: how can a song divide desire in two?”  “my flame,” i must have written or said, “coated her body like silk, one kiss spreading threads of lightening  into her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind, and i became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.”   to that he responds, “a platonic echo;” and “what will come of such a plasticine love?”  marcus aurelius, your descendent knows i’ll leave as i arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.   7.  two centuries ago, one of my ancestors sat on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning and listened to apuleius’s defense. across from him on that marble hexagon, sat two other men. on normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest,  the feast of venus coming soon. but today they listen to the madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes, cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight. away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,  you could say, they had the best seats in the house, and so they lingered and heard as much as they could then went about their business. so what if a man maries an older woman for her money, what impoverished young roman in his right mind wouldn’t do that? and sure too, if some man  comes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend, even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a fool not to sue him to the council, even if you’d have to accuse him falsely of black magic. that’s the beauty of it, or rather,  whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty, that things being already right, can be more right, which is what “beautiful” really means. and what better way, to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.   8.  marcus aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path into eternity, though they already see their journey as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding  on the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps, in basement kitchens. their pockets filled with drachmas, they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.  one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia. with enough of the language to understand direction, he engages his late night passengers. in the light of the dashboard  they’ll entrust him with their secrets. with time, he’ll become a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly, and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark  soil of philosophy. it’s the gift of seasons that stray from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh, forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.   9.  the birds that drew the line to the first distance remain nameless to me—  creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes, black/brown (dark roast) wings.  the deserts they crossed, the plains east or north of here fall like sand from my hands.  um bsisi, i want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny, native and stranger, prodigal and peasant—  admit now, they you’re none of these, that you’re not any, or even all of them combined.   10.  southwest of here is apuleius’s hometown, his inescapable destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies. “lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged, a month-long trip to the olympic games; and openhanded, he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries.  few return to madaura once gone, and when heading back shamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, taking the longest route hoping the journey would never end. here in sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him, and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began.  i look out toward madaura, my back to the theater and the latrines, madaura birthplace of augustine, site of his first schooling—little augustine holding a satchel of scrolls and a  loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,  his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the atlas, a sprinkling of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.  if the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering, why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love?  he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own. he refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces his mother’s embrace. it only lasted a month,  this partial answer, because even then everyone knew that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds, that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens  and deepens like the sea before them, a place meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth. that’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly, because god was like rain and they like the saplings  which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn. and that’s why africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished, visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.  the merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling subsidized goods to carthage and used renaults from rotterdam, ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun. there’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.  it’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers, some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim. why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived without words for so long—why not release them from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?   11.  in a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binoculars trying to catch a glimpse of the ramadan crescent, and if these migrants stick around here time will belong to the departure of other travelers,  flocks of um bsisi follwing the sun’s arch, japanese and korean trawlers sailing to gibraltar or suez chasing the last herring or sardine.  where is she now in her time?— her life dissolved in other people’s minutes, a sense of solitude her diligent companion even when she lets go of herself to kindness.  he’ll be there when she returns from the party, he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps. he’ll say, “time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.”  she’ll laugh at his words, and remember what you, marcus aurelius, had said about losing only the moment at hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves, how we stand impoverished before what is to come.  she’ll have her answer to your elocution; she’d always had an answer for you, one she refuses to share even with herself.   12.  at last they set to sail. they slaughter a rooster, douse blood on the dido figurehead adorning the prow. the seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah. his egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,  twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand. he fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco, wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife. he picks embers from the going fire, places a few  on the aluminum crown, and inhales and blows until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog, the color of semen, i think, then hands the pipe hose to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over  to the travelers in turn. the air smells sweet around us, the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine. their communion done, they embark except the one who stands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wanting  to entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in. the boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbon aiming directly for the burnt orange sun. as it reddens, for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.  then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee cooling in our cups. dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflect a constellation on the table’s dark top. i trace my fingers among them, hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus.  between my unquiet eddies, marcus aurelius, and the coursing water, the travelers’ moment sails, its tentacles sewing a rupture i had nursed for too long.

 father’s opinion of savages and dogs, a gay bloomsbury epigram: ‘the brutes may possibly have souls,’ he says, ‘but reason, no. nevertheless, i am prepared not to extend this to my spouse and children.’ this demands a careful pity: poor father! whooping and romping in their house, a holiday from ruin in the city. his wit falls flat, his tie just will not tie. the dog’s in chains, the reasonable books grazed by his children as they learn to fly. he takes his dear wife’s arm (his hands grow hooks). pirates and pudding! come, such cruelty!  his beard is branching like a burning tree.

 silence augmenteth grief, writing increaseth rage, staled are my thoughts, which loved and lost the wonder of our age; yet quickened now with fire, though dead with frost ere now, enraged i write i know not what; dead, quick, i know not how.  hard-hearted minds relent and rigor's tears abound, and envy strangely rues his end, in whom no fault was found. knowledge her light hath lost, valor hath slain her knight, sidney is dead, dead is my friend, dead is the world's delight.  place, pensive, wails his fall whose presence was her pride; time crieth out, my ebb is come; his life was my spring tide. fame mourns in that she lost the ground of her reports; each living wight laments his lack, and all in sundry sorts.  he was (woe worth that word!) to each well-thinking mind a spotless friend, a matchless man, whose virtue ever shined; declaring in his thoughts, his life, and that he writ, highest conceits, longest foresights, and deepest works of wit.  he, only like himself, was second unto none, whose death (though life) we rue, and wrong, and all in vain do moan; their loss, not him, wail they that fill the world with cries, death slew not him, but he made death his ladder to the skies.  now sink of sorrow i who live—the more the wrong! who wishing death, whom death denies, whose thread is all too long; who tied to wretched life, who looks for no relief, must spend my ever dying days in never ending grief.  farewell to you, my hopes, my wonted waking dreams, farewell, sometimes enjoyëd joy, eclipsëd are thy beams. farewell, self-pleasing thoughts which quietness brings forth, and farewell, friendship's sacred league, uniting minds of worth.  and farewell, merry heart, the gift of guiltless minds, and all sports which for life's restore variety assigns; let all that sweet is, void; in me no mirth may dwell: philip, the cause of all this woe, my life's content, farewell!  now rhyme, the son of rage, which art no kin to skill, and endless grief, which deads my life, yet knows not how to kill, go, seek that hapless tomb, which if ye hap to find salute the stones that keep the limbs that held so good a mind.

 last night i found my face below the water in my cupped hands.  the mask made of copper and bone criss-crossing to make a smirk,  a false glamour, a plated glaze. i unwound myself from the heavy  machinery of my body's burden. the lute, the light, chime.  i'll get up and partner myself with music, the purple moon  peeling itself like a plum. men stand in a circle and  they will ask and ask again. i want to pick the thick bud,  to lose myself in the body's posture bending in or away, to let  my majesty and birthright go and gesture toward a waking life.

 i saw the garden where my aunt had died and her two children and a woman from next door; it was like a burst pod filled with clay.  a mile away in the night i had heard the bombs sing and then burst themselves between cramped houses with bright soft flashes and sounds like banging doors;  the last of them crushed the four bodies into the ground, scattered the shelter, and blasted my uncle’s corpse over the housetop and into the street beyond.  now the garden lay stripped and stale; the iron shelter spread out its separate petals around a smooth clay saucer. small, and so tidy it seemed nobody had ever been there.  when i saw it, the house was blown clean by blast and care. relations had already torn out the new fireplaces; my cousin’s pencils lasted me several years.  and in his office notepad that was given me i found solemn drawings in crayon of blondes without dresses. in his lifetime i had not known him well.  these were the things i noticed at ten years of age: those, and the four hearses outside our house, the chocolate cakes, and my classmates’ half-shocked envy.  but my grandfather went home from the mortuary and for five years tried to share the noises in his skull, then he walked out and lay under a furze-bush to die.  when my father came back from identifying the daughter he asked us to remind him of her mouth. we tried. he said ‘i think it was the one’.  these were marginal people i had met only rarely and the end of the whole household meant that no grief was seen; never have people seemed so absent from their own deaths.  this bloody episode of four whom i could understand better dead gave me something i needed to keep a long story moving; i had no pain of it; can find no scar even now.  but had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up i might, in the sigh and strike of the next night’s bombs have realized a little what they meant, and for the first time been afraid.

NEW POEM
 written on a slat of a railway car:  if some time someone should find pearls threaded on a blood-red string of silk which, near the throat, runs all the thinner like life’s own path until it’s gone somewhere in a fog and can’t be seen—  if someone should find these pearls let him know how—cool, aloof—they lit up the eighteen-year-old, impatient heart of the paris dancing girl, marie.  now, dragged through unknown poland— i’m throwing my pearls through the grate.  if they’re found by a young man— let these pearls adorn his girlfriend. if they’re found by a girl— let her wear them; they belong to her. and if they’re found by an old man— let him, for these pearls, recite a prayer.

 quasi-scientific? maybe. but think of beautician , a word that assumes loveliness is brought off by technology.  she prefers cosmetologist — how it seems to have something to do with the stars. she believes she can see the future when she stares face-down at the globe of a stranger's scalp and adjusts the tilt of his head.  at the academy, she is learning about the tendencies of things to remain where they fall. she knows some tricks— spritz and gel, the so-called permanent wave. she wonders where they come from, this galaxy of dowdy customers.  some days her precision cuts hang like torn drapes on a dirty window. i see you've tried  an asymmetrical look , her instructor might say, snipping corrections. at the academy, asymmetrical  is spelled with a d.  she came here to verify what she always suspected: that straight hair must be curled, curly hair straightened, long hair cut, short hair extended. that what comes to us by fate is wrong.

 my name mocks me for i was born at the cost of my mother’s life, earning my father’s hatred with my first breath. all my life i have scoured a house soiled with the thick soot of his resentment. it has left its mark on the walls, in his eyes, and on me. all of it i have tried to wipe away. in my hands i hold a broom, in my heart— ashes, ashes.

 the street is empty as a monk’s memory, and faces explode in the flames like acorns— and the dead crowd the horizon and doorways. no vein can bleed more than it already has, no scream will rise higher than it’s already risen. we will not leave!  everyone outside is waiting for the trucks and the cars loaded with honey and hostages. we will not leave! the shields of light are breaking apart before the rout and the siege; outside, everyone wants us to leave. but we will not leave!  ivory white brides behind their veils slowly walk in captivity’s glare, waiting, and everyone outside wants us to leave, but we will not leave!  the big guns pound the jujube groves, destroying the dreams of the violets, extinguishing bread, killing the salt, unleashing thirst and parching lips and souls. and everyone outside is saying: “what are we waiting for? warmth we’re denied, the air itself has been seized! why aren’t we leaving?” masks fill the pulpits and brothels, the places of ablution. masks cross-eyed with utter amazement; they do not believe what is now so clear, and fall, astonished, writhing like worms, or tongues. we will not leave!  are we in the inside only to leave? leaving is just for the masks, for pulpits and conventions. leaving is just for the siege-that-comes-from-within, the siege that comes from the bedouin’s loins, the siege of the brethren tarnished by the taste of the blade and the stink of crows. we will not leave!  outside they’re blocking the exits and offering their blessings to the impostor, praying, petitioning almighty god for our deaths.   5.11.1983

 for old billy dugan, shot in the ass in the civil war, my father said. the old wound in my ass has opened up again, but i am past the prodigies of youth’s campaigns, and weep where i used to laugh in war’s red humors, half in love with silly-assed pains and half not feeling them. i have to sit up with an indoor unsittable itch before i go down late and weeping to the storm- cellar on a dirty night and go to bed with the worms. so pull the dirt up over me and make a family joke for old billy blue balls, the oldest private in the world with two ass-holes and no place more to go to for a laugh except the last one. say: the north won the civil war without much help from me although i wear a proof of the war’s obscenity.  
NEW POEM
 is there a single thing in nature that can approach in mystery the absolute uniqueness of any human face, first, then its transformation from childhood to old age—  we are surrounded at every instant by sights that ought to strike the sane unbenumbed person tongue-tied, mute with gratitude and terror. however,  there may be three sane people on earth at any given time: and if you got the chance to ask them how they do it, they would not understand.  i think they might just stare at you with the embarrassment of pity. maybe smile the way you do when children suddenly reveal a secret preoccupation with their origins, careful not to cause them shame,  on the contrary, to evince the great congratulating pleasure one feels in the presence of a superior talent and intelligence; or simply as one smiles to greet a friend who’s waking up, to prove no harm awaits him, you’ve dealt with and banished all harm.

 woven plaque basket with sunflower design, hopi, arizona, before 1935  from an american indian basketry exhibit in portsmouth, virginia   the arizona highway sailed across the desert— a gray battleship drawing a black wake, halting at the foot of the orange mesa, unwilling to go around.  hopi men and women—brown, and small, and claylike —peered down from their tabletops at yellow tractors, water trucks, and white men blistered with sun—red as fire ants—towing sunscreen-slathered wives in glinting airstream trailers in caravans behind them.  elders knew these bia roads were bad medicine—knew too that young men listen less and less, and these young hopi men needed work, hence set aside their tools, blocks of cottonwood root and half-finished koshari the clown katsinas, then signed on with the department of transportation,  were hired to stab drills deep into the earth’s thick red flesh on first mesa, drive giant sparking blades across the mesas’ faces, run the drill bits so deep they smoked, bearding all the hopi men in white—bad spirits, said the elders—  the blades caught fire, burned out—ma’saw is angry, the elders said. new blades were flown in by helicopter. while elders dreamed their arms and legs had been cleaved off and their torsos were flung over the edge of a dinner table, the young hopi men went back to work cutting the land into large chunks of rust.  nobody noticed at first—not the white workers, not the indian workers—but in the mounds of dismantled mesa, among the clods and piles of sand, lay the small gray bowls of babies’ skulls.  not until they climbed to the bottom did they see the silvered bones glinting from the freshly sliced dirt-and-rock wall— a mausoleum mosaic, a sick tapestry: the tiny remains roused from death’s dusty cradle, cut in half, cracked, wrapped in time-tattered scraps of blankets.  let’s call it a day, the white foreman said. that night, all the indian workers got sad-drunk—got sick —while elders sank to their kivas in prayer. next morning, as dawn festered on the horizon, state workers scaled the mesas, knocked at the doors of pueblos that had them, hollered into those without them,  demanding the hopi men come back to work—then begging them— then buying them whiskey—begging again—finally sending their white wives up the dangerous trail etched into the steep sides to buy baskets from hopi wives and grandmothers as a sign of treaty.  when that didn’t work, the state workers called the indians lazy, sent their sunhat-wearing wives back up to buy more baskets— katsinas too—then called the hopis good-for-nothings, before begging them back once more.  we’ll try again in the morning, the foreman said. but the indian workers never returned— the bia s and dot s calls to work went unanswered, as the fevered hopis stayed huddled inside.  the small bones half-buried in the crevices of mesa— in the once-holy darkness of silent earth and always-night— smiled or sighed beneath the moonlight, while white women in airstream trailers wrote letters home  praising their husbands’ patience, describing the lazy savages: such squalor in their stone and plaster homes—cobs of corn stacked floor to ceiling against crumbling walls—their devilish ceremonies and the barbaric way they buried their babies, oh, and those beautiful, beautiful baskets.

 tired with dull grief, grown old before my day, i sit in solitude and only hear long silent laughters, murmurings of dismay, the lost intensities of hope and fear; in those old marshes yet the rifles lie, on the thin breastwork flutter the grey rags, the very books i read are there—and i dead as the men i loved, wait while life drags  its wounded length from those sad streets of war into green places here, that were my own; but now what once was mine is mine no more, i seek such neighbours here and i find none. with such strong gentleness and tireless will those ruined houses seared themselves in me, passionate i look for their dumb story still, and the charred stub outspeaks the living tree.  i rise up at the singing of a bird and scarcely knowing slink along the lane, i dare not give a soul a look or word for all have homes and none's at home in vain: deep red the rose burned in the grim redoubt, the self-sown wheat around was like a flood, in the hot path the lizards lolled time out, the saints in broken shrines were bright as blood.  sweet mary's shrine between the sycamores! there we would go, my friend of friends and i, and snatch long moments from the grudging wars; whose dark made light intense to see them by ... shrewd bit the morning fog, the whining shots spun from the wrangling wire; then in warm swoon the sun hushed all but the cool orchard plots, we crept in the tall grass and slept till noon.

 four buskers almost balkanized, tonight, august 4th, the place de la contrescarpe.  every one of them in wind and limb complete, the accordionist all but a hunchback--  after the first melodious flourishes were done, the clarinet began to take his instrument apart,  blowing shorter tunes, to show the way it worked; but on a keyboard hanging from his neck  the carpenter pianist banged out routine chords and the violin a beanpole man was fingering  sliced through the edges of catalpa leaves with long shrieks, rat trills, and all in fun.  cars now orbiting the quadrangle of trees turned into tubes filled with human meat,  notes took the scent of carnage from their lager (even so, the buzz of talk, no way to stop it)  and cherry red the track suit of its rider,  the sliced leaves, iron chains that link old mooring posts around the beds of flowers.  fogged the eye with fright, and meaning trouble identical white camper caravans   rolled into view, the one behind the other, for things to jump from, us to be flung into.  rohmahniyah! he shouts, shaking his money pot, the clarinettist,ceausescu, fini! whereupon,  classic features, stepping light and fresh from reeds that told secrets of a beauty parlour.  a nice missouri girl, in gree, with pearls to plug each earlobe, pushed her wicker chair aside;  showing a dainty midriff, on steady legs she strolled across the street, as if to depollute  with every breath, every stride, the air our music for a moment had iunhabited.  then the white, lost caravans came back again, carnation milk inside, stringbags of potatoes,  family snug inside, in each a belgian grandpa, peering every which way, at the wheel.

 it’s dark in here, the dark inside of a man in the dark. it’s not night. one hears crows overhead, dawn fowl caws, the shod soles again  treading their sunlit plots above. one grows dotish-fond of such things. long live the things, their ways, their roots pushed goatish &amp; gray  through the skull, in this earth that gaily spins though one has crossed its smutted green threshold to reign in a crate. we have done no wrong,  my friends, &amp; yet we find ourselves soiled, sold, carbonized teeth in a moss-riven jaw. once i sat on a stool as my grandmother told  me of heaven. she cleaned fish for our living. i saw how her rusty black knife unseamed the sunset in each belly—coral, ochre, carmine, raw,  lice-infested sunsets in a pail. so many nights. night in the kitchen shack, night at the crumbling edge of our milk-pond province, a blade, lone cricket  raving in the lawn.

 eastham, massachusetts one of the spectators is disappointed there isn’t a guide to explain the beaching, the scientists busy cutting into ninety-four pilot whales stranded on the salt grass. no one knows why and, try as the rescue team might, not one whale will go back to water. so they’re injected to speed up the dying,  lined up like lumber and sawed into, except when the black skin splits we can’t stop staring, their meat is so red. i don’t want to know why this happens— what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly finished their love of motion. why should anything have to leave this world when water can cycle from atmosphere down to land, the ocean and back to forgiving sky.  i’m on my way to connecticut where my father has a little vegetation on his heart valve—that’s how the intern describes it, trying to minimize the danger of him slipping into a haze so cold, some nights, bone-cold, his hand can’t get from his plate to his mouth.  rain slicks the highway slowing me down. the same water fattened into snow in the woods of my childhood, the whiteness unbroken except where my father cut trails and taught me to ski, laying down the herringbone behind him as he broke up hills that left me with legs made of slush. he wanted me strong, no patience for pain. no choice but to find the muscle to follow. even now when he boasts how i zigzagged the breakneck hills in an icestorm, there’s no hint of my knee-chattering fear, slats skittering out of control, each run a victory of luck more than will, each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones. i wonder how it is for him now there in the ward where whiteness can’t hide the cold blank that’s ahead. when the whales beached, spectators came like pilgrims, each new arrival scanning the faces of those heading back to their cars to see how it changed them to survey so much death. nothing showed. their eyes followed the asphalt, heads bent in private devotion.  there in a room where others have died, my father keeps a record of each test and drug. he watches medicine drip into his arm and circle in the dark of his blood. i believe it will heal him, as i believe in the strength of my blood to protect me from failures of will. once when my grandmother at ninety-six lay delirious with pneumonia, pitching on her high horsehair bed, she saw three crows perched on the dresser.  they smell so awful, she said. please, open the window. let them out. it was my father who did what she asked. and the crows flew out, carrying her fever over the treeline, dissolving into sky, and she lived. whatever she saw, by love, luck or dumb yankee will, it was true. that’s what i mean by medicine.

 afterwards you had that drunk, drugged look my daughter used to get, when she had let go of my nipple, her mouth gone slack and her eyes turned vague and filmy, as though behind them the milk was rising up to fill her whole head, that would loll on the small white stalk of her neck so i would have to hold her closer, amazed at the sheer power of satiety, which was nothing like the needing to be fed, the wild flailing and crying until she fastened herself to me and made the seal tight between us, and sucked, drawing the liquid down and out of my body; no,this was the crowning moment, this giving of herself, knowing she could show me how helpless she was—that’s what i saw, that night when you pulled your mouth from mine and leaned back against a chain-link fence, in front of a burned-out church: a man who was going to be that vulnerable, that easy and impossible to hurt.

 when she comes back, from college, i will see the skin of her upper arms, cool, matte, glossy. she will hug me, my old soupy chest against her breasts, i will smell her hair! she will sleep in this apartment, her sleep like an untamed, good object, like a soul in a body. she came into my life the second great arrival, after him, fresh from the other world—which lay, from within him, within me. those nights, i fed her to sleep, week after week, the moon rising, and setting, and waxing—whirling, over the months, in a slow blur, around our planet. now she doesn’t need love like that, she has had it. she will walk in glowing, we will talk, and then, when she’s fast asleep, i’ll exult to have her in that room again, behind that door! as a child, i caught bees, by the wings, and held them, some seconds, looked into their wild faces, listened to them sing, then tossed them back into the air—i remember the moment the arc of my toss swerved, and they entered the corrected curve of their departure.

 i. he thinks of the chinese snake who is the beginning and the end  if you or i should die that day desire would not renew itself in any bed. the old snake of the world, eternity that holds his tail in his mouth, would spit it out and ease off through the grass like a piece of music to we don’t know where.  then it would be for the living to beat the grass and bring him back. but would he be set tamely to sucking his tail again in that absence?  ii. he marvels at the persistence of passion  like black duennas the hours sit and read our lips and watch our thighs. the years are pederasts: they wait for boys and will not meet my eyes.  and children are cool astronomers who scan us like old galaxies and calculate how many years before we’ll turn to gas or freeze.  and yet sometimes i have to shave and brush my teeth at dawn to keep my healthy middle-aged alive hands off you where you lie asleep.  iii. sometimes he contemplates adultery  i had no insanity to excuse this, but for a week my heart ran with another love, imagined another house, down to its books and bed. my miserable fluttered heart, you understand, chose this. now i am led home—cold, grave, contractual as a dog—by my scurrilous head.  iv. his hands, on a trip to wisconsin  it is night. i am a thousand miles from home. my hands lie awake and are aware of themselves, one on my noisy chest, the other, the right one, a matter of several pounds, oppressing my forehead. it is a week since it fluted the air goodbye. i think of the path in space the thing has made since then, veering and halting; of the shapes hands make washing a car, or in the uses of music.  two shapes it has traced honor this right hand: the curve that a plane rides out as it leaves or takes a deck on the scalloped sea; handily, handily then this two-pound creature felt the wired air, let the two monsters kiss, the shapes that it graphed then fairer than the hair of the clouds that watched or the sea’s own scalloped hair.  and he and his gauche fellow, moving symmetrically, have described one body so well they could dress that shape in air as they long to do now though they lie laced hunks of flesh on my belly— ahead of them some years of roving before the white landscape of age checks them, your body’s disaster, sure to be traced there, even so slight a change in a dear shape halting them, baffled, lascivious suddenly, or folded cold, or feeling your hands folded cold.  v. lines from his guest-book  shelley’s houses and walks were always a clutter of women, and god knows what further arrangements he kept in his mind. drôle de menage , rimbaud said of himself and verlaine,  as if there were any other kind. in yeats’ tower, in all that fakery of ghosts, some solid women came and slept as mrs. yeats’ guests. we are most our own strange selves when we are hosts.  here those who have loved or befriended me came to a proof: they must lodge in my head and in company under one roof. keeping house is the instinct of love; it is always a little ridiculous. yet it is with no light welcome we welcome the friends of the house.

 follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow, though thou be black as night and she made all of light, yet follow thy fair sun unhappy shadow.  follow her whose light thy light depriveth, though here thou liv’st disgraced, and she in heaven is placed, yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.  follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth, that so have scorched thee, as thou still black must be, till her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.  follow her while yet her glory shineth, there comes a luckless night, that will dim all her light, and this the black unhappy shade divineth.  follow still since so thy fates ordained, the sun must have his shade, till both at once do fade, the sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.     poetry out loud note : in the print anthology, this poem is titled "follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow." the student may give either title during the recitation.

 i consider the woman’s choice in liberating a red dress with pale-green sandals. my penury depresses me into a staring contest with a melting ice cube. a friend excited my husband with an invitation to pilot a boat with powerful thrusters. my gift of chocolate in pink cellophane failed to make the blonde smile. consequently, i remind the party-goers that trans world airlines painted a new night with nebulae.  i could be happy in alphabet city, buildings crumbling around my notepad. i could be happy sipping iced tea while admiring the seamless face of a pool. i could be happy gurgling back at an infant dribbling green saliva down his chin. i could be happy downing absolut gimlets (ice-cold, no ice) in a neighborhood bar with pool players providing the music, or a hotel whose walls are laminated with mahogany and where tuxedos prevail. i could be happy with your hand on my waist as you try to identify the scent hollowing my throat.  an entire landscape in antarctica disappears, evaporates until salt becomes the only debris. there are keys to everything, even handcuffs. you could have been happy, too.

 at a small monastery—or what had been a monastery—outside obrégon, we stopped; you were suffering the hollow nausea of your first pregnancy, sleeping as best you could through the thousand miles of pines and rocky fields of northern mexico, so i went ahead through the saddle-colored rooms, past the broken church and the row of empty sheds, where indian women, according to a sign, once baked the flat bread called sapatos de maria, to a garden in the back, over the parapet of which i could see the river through some willows: a rinsed bed of sand, dry now in winter. i didn’t want a child, and i was tired of closeness, tired of being kind, so was glad to be alone a while and lay down under a jacaranda tree, and watched through leaves the changing pattern of the sky, which i was tired of too, the scaly, stratospheric winter clouds, edged with light, like the tiny waves you pointed out, reflected on the bottom of a bridge we rowed under in a rented boat, the day you told me of the child—i was tired and slept.  it was nearly evening when i woke, two mestizo women hurried talking through the tulip beds, the sky was pale. they’d set small plaques among the plants, naming them, the ornamentals and the fruit. some, so the writing said, were descendants of the cuttings brought from spain by monks; intermingled here—pinot grape with ocotillo, damascena rose—they thrived. i thought of certain tenderness, and forbearance, a man might bring to vines and simple vegetables, cultivated in memory of his home perhaps, in a foreign place; and thought how sometimes what passes on from us has little to do with what we hoped, but nonetheless carries word of who we were and what we found. for a moment then, among the arbors and the flower beds, i did not feel so distant from this time and place, and the edge of my own local fears began to dull. i plucked a sprig—a leaf was all— from a holly bush, and brought it out to you, a little stronger in a portion of myself, a little reconciled, though i couldn’t know then that in a month we would lose the child, and in time you would pass, like a squandered fortune, from my life.

 myths of the landscape— the sun going down in the mouths of the furnaces, the fires banked and cooling, ticking into dark, here and there the sudden flaring into roses, then the light across the long factory of the field, the split and rusted castings, across the low slant tin roofs of the buildings, across fallow and tar and burnt potato ground. . . . everything a little still on fire, in sunlight, then smoke, then cinder, then the milling back to earth, rich earth, the silica of ash. the times i can taste the iron in the air, the gray wash like exhaust, smell the burn-off, my eyes begin to tear, and i'm leaning against a wall, short of breath, my heart as large as my father's, alone in such poverty my body scars the light. arable fields, waste and stony places, waysides— the day he got the job at the wellbaum and company foundry he wept, and later, in the truck, pulled the plug on a bottle. in the metallurgy of ore and coal and limestone, in the conversion of the green world to gray, in the face of the blue-white fires, i remember the fencerow, the white campion, calyx and coronal scales, the hawthorns, cut to the size of hedge, the haws so deep in the blood of the season they bled. the year we were poor enough to dig potatoes we had to drive there, then wait for the men to leave who let fires go out. there'd be one good hour of daylight, the rough straight rows running into shade. we'd work the ground until the sun was a single line. i can see my father, now cut in half by the horizon, coming toward me, both arms weighted down. i can see him bending over, gone. later, in the summer, i'd have painted the dead rust undulant sides of all the buildings aluminum, which in the morning threw a glare like water on the garden.

 the dim boy claps because the others clap. the polite word, handicapped, is muttered in the stands. isn’t it wrong, the way the mind moves back.  one whole day i sit, contrite, dirt, l.a. union station, ’46, sweating through last night. the dim boy claps because the others clap.  score, 5 to 3. pitcher fading badly in the heat. isn’t it wrong to be or not be spastic? isn’t it wrong, the way the mind moves back.  i’m laughing at a neighbor girl beaten to scream by a savage father and i’m ashamed to look. the dim boy claps because the others clap.  the score is always close, the rally always short. i’ve left more wreckage than a quake. isn’t it wrong, the way the mind moves back.  the afflicted never cheer in unison. isn’t it wrong, the way the mind moves back to stammering pastures where the picnic should have worked. the dim boy claps because the others clap.

 i  at the poem society a black-haired man stands up to say “you make me sick with all your talk about restraint and mature talent! haven’t you ever looked out the window at a painting by matisse, or did you always stay in hotels where there were too many spiders crawling on your visages? did you ever glance inside a bottle of sparkling pop, or see a citizen split in two by the lightning? i am afraid you have never smiled at the hibernation of bear cubs except that you saw in it some deep relation to human suffering and wishes, oh what a bunch of crackpots!” the black-haired man sits down, and the others shoot arrows at him. a blond man stands up and says, “he is right! why should we be organized to defend the kingdom of dullness? there are so many slimy people connected with poetry, too, and people who know nothing about it! i am not recommending that poets like each other and organize to fight them, but simply that lightning should strike them.” then the assembled mediocrities shot arrows at the blond-haired man. the chairman stood up on the platform, oh he was physically ugly! he was small-limbed and –boned and thought he was quite seductive, but he was bald with certain hideous black hairs, and his voice had the sound of water leaving a vaseline bathtub, and he said, “the subject for this evening’s discussion is poetry on the subject of love between swans.” and everyone threw candy hearts at the disgusting man, and they stuck to his bib and tucker, and he danced up and down on the platform in terrific glee and recited the poetry of his little friends—but the blond man stuck his head out of a cloud and recited poems about the east and thunder, and the black-haired man moved through the stratosphere chanting poems of the relationships between terrific prehistoric charcoal whales, and the slimy man with candy hearts sticking all over him wilted away like a cigarette paper on which the bumblebees have urinated, and all the professors left the room to go back to their duty, and all that were left in the room were five or six poets and together they sang the new poem of the twentieth century which, though influenced by mallarmé, shelley, byron, and whitman, plus a million other poets, is still entirely original and is so exciting that it cannot be here repeated. you must go to the poem society and wait for it to happen. once you have heard this poem you will not love any other, once you have dreamed this dream you will be inconsolable, once you have loved this dream you will be as one dead, once you have visited the passages of this time’s great art!   2  “oh to be seventeen years old once again,” sang the red-haired man, “and not know that poetry is ruled with the sceptre of the dumb, the deaf, and the creepy!” and the shouting persons battered his immortal body with stones and threw his primitive comedy into the sea from which it sang forth poems irrevocably blue.  who are the great poets of our time, and what are their names? yeats of the baleful influence, auden of the baleful influence, eliot of the baleful influence (is eliot a great poet? no one knows), hardy, stevens, williams (is hardy of our time?), hopkins (is hopkins of our time?), rilke (is rilke of our time?), lorca (is lorca of our time?), who is still of our time? mallarmé, valéry, apollinaire, éluard, reverdy, french poets are still of our time, pasternak and mayakovsky, is jouve of our time?  where are young poets in america, they are trembling in publishing houses and universities, above all they are trembling in universities, they are bathing the library steps with their spit, they are gargling out innocuous (to whom?) poems about maple trees and their children, sometimes they brave a subject like the villa d’este or a lighthouse in rhode island, oh what worms they are! they wish to perfect their form. yet could not these young men, put in another profession, succeed admirably, say at sailing a ship? i do not doubt it, sir, and i wish we could try them. (a plane flies over the ship holding a bomb but perhaps it will not drop the bomb, the young poets from the universities are staring anxiously at the skies, oh they are remembering their days on the campus when they looked up to watch birds excrete, they are remembering the days they spent making their elegant poems.)  is there no voice to cry out from the wind and say what it is like to be the wind, to be roughed up by the trees and to bring music from the scattered houses and the stones, and to be in such intimate relationship with the sea that you cannot understand it? is there no one who feels like a pair of pants?   3  summer in the trees! “it is time to strangle several bad poets.” the yellow hobbyhorse rocks to and fro, and from the chimney drops the strangler! the white and pink roses are slightly agitated by the struggle, but afterwards beside the dead “poet” they cuddle up comfortingly against their vase. they are safer now, no one will compare them to the sea.  here on the railroad train, one more time, is the strangler. he is going to get that one there, who is on his way to a poetry reading. agh! biff! a body falls to the moving floor.  in the football stadium i also see him, he leaps through the frosty air at the maker of comparisons between football and life and silently, silently strangles him!  here is the strangler dressed in a cowboy suit leaping from his horse to annihilate the students of myth!  the strangler’s ear is alert for the names of orpheus, cuchulain, gawain, and odysseus, and for poems addressed to jane austen, f. scott fitzgerald, to ezra pound, and to personages no longer living even in anyone’s thoughts—o strangler the strangler!  he lies on his back in the waves of the pacific ocean.   4  supposing that one walks out into the air on a fresh spring day and has the misfortune to encounter an article on modern poetry in new world writing, or has the misfortune to see some examples of some of the poetry written by the men with their eyes on the myth and the missus and the midterms, in the hudson review, or, if one is abroad, in botteghe oscure, or indeed in encounter, what is one to do with the rest of one’s day that lies blasted to ruins all bluely about one, what is one to do? o surely one cannot complain to the president, nor even to the deans of columbia college, nor to t. s. eliot, nor to ezra pound, and supposing one writes to the princess caetani, “your poets are awful!” what good would it do? and supposing one goes to the hudson review with a package of matches and sets fire to the building? one ends up in prison with trial subscriptions to the partisan, sewanee, and kenyon review!   5  sun out! perhaps there is a reason for the lack of poetry in these ill-contented souls, perhaps they need air!  blue air, fresh air, come in, i welcome you, you are an art student, take off your cap and gown and sit down on the chair.  together we shall paint the poets—but no, air! perhaps you should go to them, quickly, give them a little inspiration, they need it, perhaps they are out of breath, give them a little inhuman company before they freeze the english language to death! (and rust their typewriters a little, be sea air! be noxious! kill them, if you must, but stop their poetry! i remember i saw you dancing on the surf on the côte d’azur, and i stopped, taking my hat off, but you did not remember me, then afterwards you came to my room bearing a handful of orange flowers and we were together all through the summer night!)  that we might go away together, it is so beautiful on the sea, there are a few white clouds in the sky!  but no, air! you must go . . . ah, stay!  but she has departed and . . . ugh! what poisonous fumes and clouds! what a suffocating atmosphere! cough! whose are these hideous faces i see, what is this rigor infecting the mind? where are the green azores, fond memories of childhood, and the pleasant orange trolleys, a girl’s face, red-white, and her breasts and calves, blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes, fahrenheit temperatures, dandelions, and trains, o blue?! wind, wind, what is happening? wind! i can’t see any bird but the gull, and i feel it should symbolize . . . oh, pardon me, there’s a swan, one two three swans, a great white swan, hahaha how pretty they are! smack! oh! stop! help! yes, i see—disrespect for my superiors—forgive me, dear zeus, nice zeus, parabolic bird, o feathered excellence! white! there is achilles too, and there’s ulysses, i’ve always wanted to see them, and there is helen of troy, i suppose she is zeus too, she’s so terribly pretty—hello, zeus, my you are beautiful, bang! one more mistake and i get thrown out of the modern poetry association, help! why aren’t there any adjectives around? oh there are, there’s practically nothing else—look, here’s grey, utter,agonized, total, phenomenal, gracile, invidious, sundered, and fused, elegant, absolute, pyramidal, and . . . scream! but what can i describe with these words? states! states symbolized and divided by two, complex states, magic states, states of consciousness governed by an aroused sincerity, cockadoodle doo! another bird! is it morning? help! where am i? am i in the barnyard? oink oink, scratch, moo! splash! my first lesson. “look around you. what do you think and feel?”uhhh. . . “quickly!”this connecticut landscape would have pleasedvermeer. wham! a-plus. “congratulations!” i am promoted. ooohhhhh i wish i were dead, what a headache! my second lesson: “rewrite your first lesson line six hundred times. try to make it into a magnetic field.” i can do it too. but my poor line! what a nightmare! here comes a tremendous horse, trojan, i presume. no, it’s my third lesson. “look, look! watch him, see what he’s doing? that’s what we want you to do. of course it won’t be the same as his at first, but . . .” i demur. is there no other way to fertilize minds? bang! i give in . . . already i see my name in two or three anthologies, a serving girl comes into the barn bringing me the anthologies, she is very pretty and i smile at her a little sadly, perhaps it is my last smile! perhaps she will hit me! but no, she smiles in return, and she takes my hand. my hand, my hand! what is this strange thing i feel in my hand, on my arm, on my chest, my face—can it be . . . ? it is! air! air, air, you’ve come back! did you have any success? “what do you think?” i don’t know, air. you are so strong, air. and she breaks my chains of straw, and we walk down the road, behind us the hideous fumes! soon we reach the seaside, she is a young art student who places her head on my shoulder, i kiss her warm red lips, and here is the strangler, reading the kenyonreview! good luck to you, strangler! goodbye, helen! goodbye, fumes! goodbye, abstracted dried-up boys! goodbye, dead trees! goodbye, skunks! goodbye, manure! goodbye, critical manicure! goodbye, you big fat men standing on the east coast as well as the west giving poems the test! farewell, valéry’s stern dictum! until tomorrow, then, scum floating on the surface of poetry! goodbye for a moment, refuse that happens to land in poetry’s boundaries! adieu, stale eggs teaching imbeciles poetry to bolster up your egos! adios, boring anomalies of these same stale eggs! ah, but the scum is deep! come, let me help you! and soon we pass into the clear blue water. oh goodbye, castrati of poetry! farewell, stale pale skunky pentameters (the only honest english meter, gloop gloop!) until tomorrow, horrors! oh, farewell!  hello, sea! good morning, sea! hello, clarity and excitement, you great expanse of green—  o green, beneath which all of them shall drown!

(my mother ... ) all the while i kept thinking:her face has such a wild look ... as though she had never existed the fact is i have not yet seen her in daylight distance must remain distance a few proud buildings; your lovely photograph i find this loss very hard to bear the bells are ringing, i don’t quite know why what makes all autobiographies worthless is, after all, their mendacity yesterday and today have been bad days this oceanic feeling, continuous inner monologues i said, “all the beautiful things i still have to say will have to remain unsaid,” and the writing table flooded

 what can i do but make of the eyes of others my own eyes, but make of the world a ghazal whose radif is a haunting of me, me, me?  somewhere there are fingers still whole to tell the story of the empire that devours fingers. somewhere there is a city where even larvae  cannot clean the wounds of the living and cannot eat on the countless dead who are made to die tomorrow and tomorrow.  carrion beetles and boot bottoms grind corpses powder-soft to feed the small-mouthed gods of gardens and wind. roses made to toss their silk  to earth like immolated gowns, hills spewing ribbons of charred air from cities occupied by artillery and pilfered grain, limbs  blown from their bodies and made into an alphabet that builds this fool song, even now, presented before you as false curative, as vacant kiss — even  what is lost in the fabrication of strangers needs naught from strangers. even somewhere stings with stillness, stings with a home not surrendered but a given.  •  but i have not been with my feet on the earth there where bullets make use of skin like flags make use of the land. my thinking is as skeletal  as the bombed-out schools and houses untelevised. what do i know of occupation but my own colonized thinking to shake  free from. while my days themselves tremble from time and shake off place to feel falsely placeless, a hollow empathy as if its soft chisel  could make of this wall — my ignorance mighty before me upon which drawn figures alight against the stone — my own; what is mine is  the wall my votes and non-votes, my purchases wrapped in unthought have built and stretched, undead gray. there are no secrets in debris.  i have a home i hate, its steel and lights red and blue upon me. home itself a mist through which i pass and barely notice.  home, to assume you are home is to assume i am welcome in you — to what degree let the wounds say so — and can come and go as i please.  the television tells me over there, and one must point with a fully extended arm to show how far from, how unlike here there really is.over there  where they blow each other up over land and god. and it feels good to stretch as if from waking — this silence could be called a kind of sleep — and think beyond, where i am not and where those who are are not — wall upon which drawings of fists strike skyward and faces of activists stare into me  from my google search. turnstiles separate home from home. barbed wire catches clouds in its coil saws. what do i know of injustice  but having a home throughout which bullets, ballots, and brutality trifecta against people who were here before here was here  and people were brought here to change the landscape of humanity? that word has rolling hills and towering walls. to hammer against it not to get  to the other side — believe nothing is there — but to make obsolete side— know there is nothing. i know this: my metaphors have small arms,  my wallet has made monstrous my reflection, i have done terrible things by being alive. i have built a wonder of terror with my life.  •    [image of an eight-meter-tall wall, constructed by connected prefabrications. interspersed among them are surveillances (i’ll make them pay). what is closed opens then settles. spill: a scream, what makes it. on the wall a body leans, which is a caption: “this is not prayer.” (which side are you on?) here where there is no here, endurance measured by a field’s disruption and around it what makes possible a furthering (to settle this in court or to settle in this courtyard). argument: this thinking is real because it has been made touchable if touch is the mutual rejection of objects from entering into the other (let’s settle this once and for all) who’s going to pay for what reaches toward and fails at heaven? to settle the debt, settle in silence. if it is not silent (this roaring (is it fire / stone / a pen lifting (ban no ban no b — ) or falling?) is it home?) make it so.]  •  between his war with self and the war in a sand-sealed country neither of us could spell, juvie took from r what little childhood  chicago hadn’t taken. between bloody showers and rushed meals, him forced by bigger boys until pain became expectation and expectation  pleasure. a shortened sentence meant fighting for a country against people for whom r held no hatred while hating the ones he fought for.  there is venom in coercion misnamed loyalty. boys and bloody water in his head when he left to fight in heat and camo. then in the barrack’s  shower, three soldiers raped r. sand is the plaza of pardon. wind draws its name across the grains and leaves the grains with the name it gave.  who would i be after so many tried to live in me forcibly? r in the desert, our skype lost connection when an explosion blew out  what little service he had.oh shit, we been hit. then blackout silence and my pulse explicit. let us rejoice in this:  war is a love song that makes your body dangerous to others, that makes you unlivable. you become more private. you are always early to yourself.  when i saw him again, marijuana discharged him dishonorably and the men inside him shooting guns and shooting cum went with him. this is one veteran’s  legacy, one man i know and have lost to distance, my own pulling me from everything i’m meant to hold close. what do i know of exile but self-imposed  self-removal. when r kissed my forehead goodbye the first time i felt citizenly, patriotic, my white handkerchief au revoir-ing a friend from my mind  who returned with sand hissing down his pant legs. a hero is an hourglass. for what does his countdown drop its grains, skull to heel?

grief knows the passage  of the worm and the temperatures of dirt.  sky knows the neon of kite sail and tail.  fifteen thousand names written in the air  by ribbon, rhombi billowed into shields,  glide into the guinness book of records , memories  passed page to page across oceans and treaties  in ink out-blacking smoke. waves leave soft creases  on the gaza strip and know airborne diamonds  by the shadows of their measured shapes  tethered like falcons to a child’s quick hands ...  how to mistake american arrogance for love, to think kites could humanize the already-human and hide the anti-human from its history.  why cloak our custom of cloaking? to make palatable the blade we turn on ourselves we turn it on others. in good light the metal will give  us back to ourselves. does the wolf know it has a reflection? ask the water if it shows to us its beast self or has one given to it.  •    [image of an eight-meter-tall wall, over which is painted “is you coming or going or is i?” a ray of light ballistic through the form is both answer and rejection of an answer’s possibility.]  •  tragedy disturbs tragedy. there can never be just one way to see the end to ourselves.  the mediterranean has endless room where capsized boats of hundreds bloomed once with refugees. water can’t be trusted.  the wind with its countless hands hasting water into waves can’t be seen so can’t be trusted even though we feel it, even when we  know along its unseen force bobs curt hymns from the dead to the living. we don’t hear them rising from the salt like fins. we hear bombs  and think each storm carries the broken criesof a broken nation in its contortion. alibi for the living is the land: it’s the earth  itself that refuses the dead a home in burr or field, in the stone plateaus or tableaux of scree from a city of wild boars and roads  that lead to a burning garden, a gutted church, a school uniform hemmed by soldiers, a birch limned with blood and pointing dually  west to a row of houses roofless but for crows and east to a rifle hung above a threshold like a saint. something’s always watching, well-aimed  and unkind, empty and on fire or just- finished burning. and the water will rust the skin, will extinguish the fire and the flesh.  baptism is what the living do. the rest are left to idols of fish and worm, are left with the living’s pens and books bereft  and intricate as mausolea woven from husks of stories the dead cannot tell. they brux in our renditions as we cull their truth for our song.  •  the wilderness within us creeps closer to the surface of thought and burial. we drag ourselves from the selves  that laid bear traps that trapped us into our own dragging, one leg limp behind like a memory pain brings forward. low grass collects  pockets of our blood as if any gloss could reduce droughts in the smallest needs. if we make eye contact with the most beleaguered  of us, we pray the remains of god would shower spears to smite clean such embarrassment. we are not neighbors, just near. we are failures of nature  and the stars burn down through trees no light we can trust. because we were shrewd with conviction the pads of our right hands’ digits have singed  into them one letter each to spell faith. what we touch with that hand will fell our enemies who are ourselves. we draw a maze with our blood,  follow paths drawn from the cruelties sculpted into another’s body. i am losted by a child’s missing eye, dead-ended by a family encrusted with shrapnel.  if i follow my own disaster more closely, if i allow buzzards spiraling above prophecy enough to reveal time as caught in the loop  of their pinions, if i remove my shirt from my bloodied torso and twist from it my own oil, if in my pocket  i find the final ballot before the mine was tripped in god’s patience, if i see my vote had predicted the immolation of seasons  and the beheading of goats sacrificed to rain that washed away no blood and emulsified sickness into the oceans and seas, if pain rises  from the mouths of the dead in the shape the dead took when alive, if all this time we’ve been building tombs and calling them home —  •    [image of an eight-meter-tall wall bearing a hole in its center, or a 1.7272-meter-tall wall, which is me, bearing a hole in my center. i am the wall and the hole is what makes me better. i want to be better.]  •  hajjar, does a body on its back act as the body’s own grief?

 the frost performs its secret ministry, unhelped by any wind. the owlet's cry came loud—and hark, again! loud as before. the inmates of my cottage, all at rest, have left me to that solitude, which suits abstruser musings: save that at my side my cradled infant slumbers peacefully. 'tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness. sea, hill, and wood, this populous village! sea, and hill, and wood, with all the numberless goings-on of life, inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not; only that film, which fluttered on the grate,  still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing. methinks, its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live, making it a companionable form, whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets, every where echo or mirror seeking of itself, and makes a toy of thought.  but o! how oft, how oft, at school, with most believing mind, presageful, have i gazed upon the bars, to watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft with unclosed lids, already had i dreamt of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower, whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang from morn to evening, all the hot fair-day, so sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come! so gazed i, till the soothing things, i dreamt, lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams! and so i brooded all the following morn, awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book: save if the door half opened, and i snatched a hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up, for still i hoped to see the stranger's face, townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, my play-mate when we both were clothed alike!  dear babe, that sleepest cradled by my side, whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm, fill up the intersperséd vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought! my babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart with tender gladness, thus to look at thee, and think that thou shalt learn far other lore, and in far other scenes! for i was reared in the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim, and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars. but thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds, which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language, which thy god utters, who from eternity doth teach himself in all, and all things in himself. great universal teacher! he shall mould thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.  therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee, whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy apple-tree, while the night-thatch smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall heard only in the trances of the blast, or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles, quietly shining to the quiet moon.

 looking up, “the purple now,” she dips her brush and finishes the day. the flag  descends. she draws the fire with a marker on fax paper uncurling from its spool.  inventory of glasses, the handblown ones blue-edged could hold a sunset neat, the new  regime is softball-sized and etched with tigers. in town they’re pulling draughts for every swinging  door. don’t get angry, don’t get angry. the soaker’s washed and left to dry. iron  hessians oversee the fire gone to bed beside the harbor, geese calling  each to each triangulate the dark. passing through or are they wintering over?  in chevron resolve. like waking to the rain and walking anyway. she  thinking of what to do with pawpaw  jelly, he of mildew and of marrow, while  their youngest bouncing gums the leather dice cup, sister rolls, counts, and makes  a point. get even says the horizon like the sun, democratic and unsparing.

 i know the origin of rocks, settling out of water, hatching crystals from fire, put under pressure in various designs i gathered pretty, picnic after picnic.  and i know about love, a little, igneous lust, the slow affections of the sedimentary, the pressure on earth out of sight to rise up into material, something solid you can hold, a whole mountain, for example, or a loose collection of pebbles you forgot you were keeping.  
NEW POEM
 time to give up grieving my mother’s loss, faulting my father and his neolithic moral certitude about every detail on the evening news, his general absence hanging like the gray sheets on the line.  never mind how mismatched in the heart, i should be grateful they were there at all, for that moment that childhood stretched like fog, the beach empty and unmarked.  it comes to little now who i forgive, mourn, or thank. the dust shifts and we are barely suspended in the light.  i know this little thing: there’s a boy somewhere in a station where the trains still run, wearing scuffed brown shoes, gray overcoat, and cap; someone has neatly parted and combed his hair. he is waiting to be taken by the hand and told where we are going, to hear we are headed home— though i can see nothing beyond the smoke and midnight haze at the far end of the platform, where i am not even sure of the stars.

NEW POEM
 i  i can hear little clicks inside my dream. night drips its silver tap down the back. at 4 a.m. i wake. thinking  of the man who left in september. his name was law.  my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it. i rinse the face and return to bed. tomorrow i am going to visit my mother.   she  she lives on a moor in the north. she lives alone. spring opens like a blade there. i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books—  some for my mother, some for me including the collected works of emily brontë. this is my favourite author.  also my main fear, which i mean to confront. whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily brontë,  my lonely life around me like a moor, my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door. what meat is it, emily, we need?    three  three silent women at the kitchen table. my mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor, paralyzed with ice. it extends as far as the eye can see  over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky. mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully. the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps  once a minute over the twelve. i have emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother.  a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside. my mother is studying her lettuce. i turn to p. 217.  “in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway. . . .”  it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass. now and then a remark trails through the glass. taxes on the back lot. not a good melon,  too early for melons. hairdresser in town found god, closes shop every tuesday. mice in the teatowel drawer again. little pellets. chew off  the corners of the napkins, if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays. rain tonight.  rain tomorrow. that volcano in the philippines at it again. what’s her name anderson died no not shirley  the opera singer. negress. cancer. not eating your garnish, you don’t like pimento?  out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth. at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a depression, the ice has begun to unclench. black open water comes  curdling up like anger. my mother speaks suddenly. that psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it? you aren’t getting over him.  my mother has a way of summing things up. she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life.  well he’s a taker and you’re a giver i hope it works out, was all she said after she met him. give and take were just words to me  at the time. i had not been in love before. it was like a wheel rolling downhill. but early this morning while mother slept  and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in! come in! to the ghost of his heart’s darling,  i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too. she knows how to hang puppies, that emily.  it isn’t like taking an aspirin you know, i answer feebly. dr. haw says grief is a long process. she frowns. what does it accomplish  all that raking up the past? oh—i spread my hands— i prevail! i look her in the eye. she grins. yes you do.   whacher  whacher, emily’s habitual spelling of this word, has caused confusion. for example  in the first line of the poem printed tell me, whether, is it winter? in the shakespeare head edition. but whacher is what she wrote.  whacher is what she was. she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night. she whached eyes, stars, inside, outside, actual weather.  she whached the bars of time, which broke. she whached the poor core of the world, wide open.  to be a whacher is not a choice. there is nowhere to get away from it, no ledge to climb up to—like a swimmer  who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off, it just flies open. to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy,  although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel, grazing with euphemism the work of whaching.  but it has no name. it is transparent. sometimes she calls it thou.  “emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet,” records charlotte in 1828. unsociable even at home  and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out, emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers.  this sad stunted life, says one. uninteresting, unremarkable, wracked by disappointment and despair, says another.  she could have been a great navigator if she’d been male, suggests a third. meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question,  why cast the world away. for someone hooked up to thou, the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence.  but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face “lit up by a divine light”  and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life, is a space where the little raw soul  slips through. it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel, out of sight.  the little raw soul was caught by no one. she didn’t have friends, children, sex, religion, marriage, success, a salary or a fear of death. she worked  in total six months of her life (at a school in halifax) and died on the sofa at home at 2 p.m. on a winter afternoon in her thirty-first year. she spent  most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet, walking the moor or whaching. she says  it gave her peace. “all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day 4 years,” she wrote in her diary paper of 1837.  yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons, vaults, cages, bars, curbs, bits, bolts, fetters, locked windows, narrow frames, aching walls.  “why all the fuss?” asks one critic. “she wanted liberty. well didn’t she have it? a reasonably satisfactory homelife,  a most satisfactory dreamlife—why all this beating of wings? what was this cage, invisible to us, which she felt herself to be confined in?”  well there are many ways of being held prisoner, i am thinking as i stride over the moor. as a rule after lunch mother has a nap  and i go out to walk. the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light.  something inside it reminds me of childhood— it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick  and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering  something they never tell. you remember too much, my mother said to me recently.  why hold onto all that? and i said, where can i put it down? she shifted to a question about airports.  crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun.  on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else.  perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days. it is as if i could dip my hand down  into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country.  i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotape—here we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house, shadows  of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips.  law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea. time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room  and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying, you beauty. i can feel that beauty’s  heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room— no, i say aloud. i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water  and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood. i stop and turn and stand into the wind,  which now plunges towards me over the moor. when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die. this is not uncommon.  i took up the practice of meditation. each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers.  de profundis clamavi ad te domine. each morning a vision came to me. gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul.  i called them nudes. nude #1. woman alone on a hill. she stands into the wind.  it is a hard wind slanting from the north. long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift and blow away on the wind, leaving  an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth. it pains me to record this,  i am not a melodramatic person. but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights.  charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece. like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte  talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emily’s workshop—about the inexorable spirit (“stronger than a man, simpler than a child”),  the cruel illness (“pain no words can render”), the autonomous end (“she sank rapidly, she made haste to leave us”) and about emily’s total subjection  to a creative project she could neither understand nor control, and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth  “to breathe lightning.” the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning  and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere. it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there  but emily is not responsible. emily was in the grip. “having formed these beings she did not know what she had done,” says charlotte (of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine).  well there are many ways of being held prisoner. the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes, “on herself she had no pity.”  pitiless too are the heights, which emily called wuthering because of their “bracing ventilation” and “a north wind over the edge.”  whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her father’s house on every side, formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit,  taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities— an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another. “my love for heathcliff,” says catherine,  “resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight, but necessary.” necessary? i notice the sun has dimmed  and the afternoon air sharpening. i turn and start to recross the moor towards home. what are the imperatives  that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach  of one another when it hardens? what kind of necessity is that? the last time i saw law was a black night in september. autumn had begun,  my knees were cold inside my clothes. a chill fragment of moon rose. he stood in my living room and spoke  without looking at me. not enough spin on it, he said of our five years of love. inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces  which floated apart. by now i was so cold it was like burning. i put out my hand to touch his. he moved back.  i don’t want to be sexual with you, he said. everything gets crazy. but now he was looking at me. yes, i said as i began to remove my clothes.  everything gets crazy. when nude i turned my back because he likes the back. he moved onto me.  everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself  thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me. there was no area of my mind  not appalled by this action, no part of my body that could have done otherwise. but to talk of mind and body begs the question.  soul is the place, stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind, where such necessity grinds itself out.  soul is what i kept watch on all that night. law stayed with me. we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time,  caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language like the children we used to be. that was a night that centred heaven and hell,  as emily would say. we tried to fuck but he remained limp, although happy. i came again and again, each time accumulating lucidity,  until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries  visible around them like lines on a map. i saw the lines harden. he left in the morning.  it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind. at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away.   kitchen  kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in. no sound from the rest of the house. i wait a moment then open the fridge.  brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion. my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed. after extracting the yogurt container  from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door. bluish dusk  fills the room like a sea slid back. i lean against the sink. white foods taste best to me  and i prefer to eat alone. i don’t know why. once i heard girls singing a may day song that went:  violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone.  girls are cruelest to themselves. someone like emily brontë, who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman,  had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow. we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet.  reason with him and then whip him! was her instruction (age six) to her father regarding brother branwell.  and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode (they say) into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm.  cauterization of heathcliff took longer. more than thirty years in the time of the novel, from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor  because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s (“it would degrade me to marry heathcliff”) until the wild morning  when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights. heathcliff is a pain devil.  if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence (“so he will never know how i love him”)  heathcliff would have been set free. but emily knew how to catch a devil. she put into him in place of a soul  the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought. she broke all his moments in half,  with the kitchen door standing open. i am not unfamiliar with this half-life. but there is more to it than that.  heathcliff’s sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë, so far as we know. her question,  which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil, came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen (“kichin” in emily’s spelling) where she  and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet. there is a fragment  of a poem she wrote in 1839 (about six years before wuthering heights) that says:  that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy: he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky.  who is the iron man? my mother’s voice cuts across me, from the next room where she is lying on the sofa.  is that you dear? yes ma. why don’t you turn on a light in there?  out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky. okay ma. what’s for supper?   liberty  liberty means different things to different people. i have never liked lying in bed in the morning. law did. my mother does.  but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it— moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake.  i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper. i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free.  out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost. the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky. frozen mud crunches underfoot. the sound  startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke, one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s  arms like a needle in water—it is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hips—i  turn and face into the wind and begin to run. goblins, devils and death stream behind me.  in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life. i had no home in goodness anymore.  to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible.  perhaps this is what people mean by original sin, i thought. but what love could be prior to it? what is prior?  what is love? my questions were not original. nor did i answer them.  mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul, not the complex mysteries of love and hate.  but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight. there were in all thirteen of them.  nude #2. woman caught in a cage of thorns. big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way  unable to stand upright. nude #3. woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead. she grips it in both hands  endeavouring to wrench it out. nude #4. woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch.  covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab. with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater  she works hard at dislodging the crab. it was about this time i began telling dr. haw  about the nudes. she said, when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them? why keep watching? why not  go away? i was amazed. go away where? i said. this still seems to me a good question.  but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk. i have reached the middle  where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water. it is frozen. a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes.  certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black. four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air. each trunk  where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures— thousands of hair-thin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face  catching grins through the bars. emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says  a messenger of hope, comes every night to me and offers, for short life, eternal liberty.  i wonder what kind of liberty this is. her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death.  they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter by nineteenth-century life in a remote parish on a cold moor  in the north of england. they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life. “in so much of brontë’s work  the self-dramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama,” says one. another  refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world. i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question,  why keep watching? some people watch, that’s all i can say. there is nowhere else to go,  no ledge to climb up to. perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment, as with a very difficult sister.  “on that mind time and experience alone could work: to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable,” wrote charlotte of emily.  i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage. “my sister emily  was not a person of demonstrative character,” charlotte emphasizes, “nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings, even those nearest and dearest to her could,  with impunity, intrude unlicensed. . . .” recesses were many. one autumn day in 1845 charlotte “accidentally lighted on a ms. volume of verse in my sister emily’s handwriting.”  it was a small (4 x 6) notebook with a dark red cover marked 6d. and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand.  charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt “more than surprise” at its quality. “not at all like the poetry women generally write.”  further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel, not least for its foul language. she gently probes this recess  in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights. “a large class of readers, likewise, will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work  of words printed with all their letters, which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter only—a blank line filling the interval.”  well, there are different definitions of liberty. love is freedom, law was fond of saying. i took this to be more a wish than a thought  and changed the subject. but blank lines do not say nothing. as charlotte puts it,  “the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse, strikes me as a proceeding which,  however well meant, is weak and futile. i cannot tell what good it does—what feeling it spares— what horror it conceals.”  i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast. it is a two-way traffic,  the language of the unsaid. my favourite pages of the collected works of emily brontë are the notes at the back  recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emily’s verse, which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death. “prison for strongest[in emily’s hand] altered to lordly by charlotte.”   hero  i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not.  not. she puts her toast down on the side of her plate. you know you can pull the drapes in that room, she begins.   this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments, from what i call the rules of life series. my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night.  i open mine as wide as possible. i like to see everything, i say. what’s there to see?  moon. air. sunrise. all that light on your face in the morning. wakes you up. i like to wake up.  at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels. there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel,  the stubborn as your father channel and random channel. more toast? i interpose strongly, pushing back my chair.  those women! says my mother with an exasperated rasp. mother has chosen random channel. women?  complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper lying beside the grape jam.  the front page has a small feature about a rally for international women’s day— have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue?  nope. why, it’s a disgrace! those bathing suits— cut way up to here! (she points) no wonder!  you’re saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have high-cut legs? ma, are you serious?  well someone has to be responsible. why should women be responsible for male desire? my voice is high. oh i see you’re one of them.  one of whom? my voice is very high. mother vaults it. and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one? it looked so smart on you.  the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid. she will be eighty years old this summer.  her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around.  so ma, we’ll go—i pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate— visit dad today? she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility.  leave at eleven, home again by four? i continue. she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes. silence is assent in our code. i go into the next room to phone the taxi.  my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about 50 miles from here. he suffers from a kind of dementia  characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer. first, the presence in cerebral tissue  of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque, consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells. second, neurofibrillary snarlings  in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus. there is no known cause or cure. mother visits him by taxi once a week  for the last five years. marriage is for better or for worse, she says, this is the worse.  so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town. the april light is clear as an alarm.  as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow. i wish i could carry this clarity with me  into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce. i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy. these are my two wishes.  it is hard to find the beginning of dementia. i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone.  it was a sunday night in winter. i heard his sentences filling up with fear. he would start a sentence—about weather, lose his way, start another. it made me furious to hear him floundering—  my tall proud father, former world war ii navigator! it made me merciless. i stood on the edge of the conversation,  watching him thrash about for cues, offering none, and it came to me like a slow avalanche  that he had no idea who he was talking to. much colder today i guess. . . . his voice pressed into the silence and broke off,  snow falling on it. there was a long pause while snow covered us both. well i won’t keep you,  he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land. i’ll say goodnight now, i won’t run up your bill. goodbye.  goodbye. goodbye. who are you? i said into the dial tone.  at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock (5—25—3)  to the west wing, for chronic care patients. each wing has a name. the chronic wing is our golden mile  although mother prefers to call it the last lap. father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles.  my father tilts least, i am proud of him. hi dad how y’doing? his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage  and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air. my mother lays her hand on his. hello love, she says. he jerks his hand away. we sit.  sunlight flocks through the room. mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him, grapes, arrowroot biscuits, humbugs.  he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us. he uses a language known only to himself, made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals.  once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash— you don’t say! or happy birthday to you!— but no real sentence  for more than three years now. i notice his front teeth are getting black. i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people.  he always took good care of his teeth. my mother looks up. she and i often think two halves of one thought. do you remember that gold-plated toothpick  you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london? she asks. yes i wonder what happened to it. must be in the bathroom somewhere.  she is giving him grapes one by one. they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers. he used to be a big man, over six feet tall and strong,  but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house— except the hands. the hands keep growing. each one now as big as a boot in van gogh,  they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap. but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high note—he waits,  staring into my face. that quizzical look. one eyebrow at an angle. i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home.  it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane. hands firmly behind backs, legs wide apart, chins forward.  dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch. they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942.  it is dawn. they are leaving dover for france. my father on the far left is the tallest airman,  with his collar up, one eyebrow at an angle. the shadowless light makes him look immortal,  for all the world like someone who will not weep again. he is still staring into my face. flaps down! i cry. his black grin flares once and goes out like a match.   hot  hot blue moonlight down the steep sky. i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark. fumbling  and slowly consciousness replaces the bars. dreamtails and angry liquids  swim back down to the middle of me. it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now. this is not uncommon after loss of love—  blue and black and red blasting the crater open. i am interested in anger. i clamber along to find the source.  my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed. she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires. each wire has a little black switch.  one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on. she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger.  then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house. the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit  and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creatures—not quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws  under a load of time. i want to be beautiful again, she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily  as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound, comes— my pajamas are soaked.  anger travels through me, pushes aside everything else in my heart, pouring up the vents. every night i wake to this anger,  the soaked bed, the hot pain box slamming me each way i move. i want justice. slam.  i want an explanation. slam. i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever. slam. i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp. night springs  out the window and is gone over the moor. i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses.  emily brontë was good at cursing. falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse.  well, thou halt paid me back my love! but if there be a god above whose arm is strong, whose word is true, this hell shall wring thy spirit too!  the curses are elaborate:  there go, deceiver, go! my hand is streaming wet; my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessing—to forget! oh could that lost heart give back, back again to thine, one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline!  but they do not bring her peace:  vain words, vain frenzied thoughts! no ear can hear me call— lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall. . . .  unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still— life bows to my control, but love i cannot kill!  her anger is a puzzle. it raises many questions in me, to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt  by someone who rarely left home “except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” (charlotte tells us) and who  had no more intercourse with haworth folk than “a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates.”  how did emily come to lose faith in humans? she admired their dialects, studied their genealogies, “but with them she rarely exchanged a word.”  her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor. what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith? among her biographers  is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her six-month stay in halifax, but there is no evidence at all for such an event  and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 years. banal sexism aside, i find myself tempted  to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily. but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation.  as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women. it is a chilly thought.  the heart is dead since infancy. unwept for let the body go.  suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin. the vocation of anger is not mine. i know my source.  it is stunning, it is a moment like no other, when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore. i switch off the lamp and lie on my back,  thinking about emily’s cold young soul. where does unbelief begin? when i was young  there were degrees of certainty. i could say, yes i know that i have two hands. then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear—  from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep. out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky.  our guests are darkly lodged, i whispered, gazing through the vault . . .   thou  the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness. and i prefer to put it off. it is morning.  astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east. i am walking into the light. one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god.  emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou. she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power.  thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind. thou and emily influence one another in the darkness, playing near and far at once.  she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one.” i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet, there is no question,  it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night, without the terrible sex price to pay. this is a childish idea, i know.  my education, i have to admit, has been gappy. the basic rules of male-female relations were imparted atmospherically in our family,  no direct speech allowed. i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car. father in front.  we were waiting in the driveway for mother, who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car  dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels. father glanced sideways at her. showing a good bit of leg today mother, he said  in a voice which i (age eleven) thought odd. i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say. her answer would clear this up.  but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it. later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs.  she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen. well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men,  she was saying. laugh. not ropes, thorns. i have arrived at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a low swampy place. the swamp water is frozen solid. bits of gold weed  have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages.  i’ll come when thou art saddest, laid alone in the darkened room; when the mad day’s mirth has vanished, and the smile of joy is banished,  i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling has entire, unbiased sway, and my influence o’er thee stealing grief deepening, joy congealing, shall bear thy soul away.  listen! ’tis just the hour, the awful time for thee: dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll, forerunners of a sterner power, heralds of me?  very hard to read, the messages that pass between thou and emily. in this poem she reverses their roles,  speaking not as the victim but to the victim. it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou, who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered.  it is a shock to realize that this low, slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale  for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour. she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power  but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass, which is her true creation.  those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn. it is who i am.  is it a vocation of anger? why construe silence as the real presence?  why stoop to kiss this doorstep? why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul?  emily was fond of psalm 130. “my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning, i say more than they that watch for the morning.”  i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter,  that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire: ”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns,“ says the psalmist.  but for myself i do not believe this, i am not quenched— with thou or without thou i find no shelter. i am my own nude.  and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny. i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now,  from love to anger to this cold marrow, from fire to shelter to fire. what is the opposite of believing in thou—  merely not believing in thou? no. that is too simple. that is to prepare a misunderstanding. i want to speak more clearly.  perhaps the nudes are the best way. nude #5. deck of cards. each card is made of flesh.  the living cards are days of a woman’s life. i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end. nude #6 i cannot remember.  nude #7. white room whose walls, having neither planes nor curves nor angles, are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane  like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon. it is a living surface, almost wet. lucency breathes in and out.  rainbows shudder across it. and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering, be very careful. be very careful.  nude #8. black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row. a woman stands on the disc  amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her. nude #9. transparent loam.  under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench. into the trench she is placing small white forms, i don’t know what they are. nude #10. green thorn of the world poking up  alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground. the thorn is exploding  its green blood above her in the air. everything it is it has, the voice says. nude #11. ledge in outer space.  space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions, shrieking past the woman who stands pinned  to nothing by its pressure. she peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot. nude #12. old pole in the wind.  cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines  some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole. i cannot see how they are attached—  notches? staples? nails? all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots,  then untie and float down. the wind is gone. it waits.  by this time, midway through winter, i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama. then it stopped.  days passed, months passed and i saw nothing. i continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning  with my nerves open to the air like something skinned. i saw nothing. outside the window spring storms came and went.  april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches. i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought,  how slow! as it glided soundlessly past, but still—nothing. no nudes. no thou.  a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle, hoping to trick myself into some interior vision,  but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing.  i stopped watching. i forgot about nudes. i lived my life,  which felt like a switched-off tv. something had gone through me and out and i could not own it. “no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind.  emily does not feel them,” wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister. emily had shaken free.  a soul can do that. whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings,  you and i will never know. but i can tell you what i saw. nude #13 arrived when i was not watching for it. it came at night.  very much like nude #1. and yet utterly different. i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air.  it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached, but as i came closer i saw it was a human body  trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones. and there was no pain. the wind  was cleansing the bones. they stood forth silver and necessary. it was not my body, not a woman’s body, it was the body of us all. it walked out of the light.

200 fall out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water. he hears the iv tubes bursting, the sweet plasma spinning between the walls, the bag slipping to the floor and splattering through the night’s open screens.  the man screams. vomits blood and ulcers. gets tangled up in sheets and transparent plastic veins. after half an hour doves fly in. the leaves fall. fast.  after a few days a black man enters room 199. an orderly. he cleans his body with a warm sponge. his hands run slowly down the yellowed back, the belly and fragile shoulders of randi. dark birds fly over a forgotten landscape.

 after our rendez-vous—this the last word he said, waving to me as the train pulled away from the station. and so it seemed: harmless. till evening brought the first prick of fever, which soon trellised my veins; at 2 am came that knock on the city gates, little pig, little pig, let me come in. . . . ha! ever a bold and warlike people, we didn’t.  days of siege. we threw corpses dead of plague from the tops of parapets to frighten it away: but what was it? that vatic voice was not like his at all, and by its speech one could tell it somehow knew us well. the mystery deepened. a strange billowing cloud made my people short of breath, i heard them wheezing. the end seemed near. what could this ailment be?  hunting  out clues, i went over the roses and snows of his departed face like a treasure map, over his words hanging in air like the scrolls of alexandria. had i not been consensual, a free agent, gay, single as any singing lark, who chooses to unlock, to whom? well? one night, finally, i climbed our tallest tower, lay  in the open on its roof and had a brilliant dream. i saw my body nestled between angels like the body of the prophet jesus, i saw it leaking from a finger’s tip like a slit ragdoll. and then i saw: this feathery, amorphous creature black as mildew in the bath, soft as bread mold, chewing on my bloodpuddings in the corner.  and then i knew! that morning, i went out by the porter’s door pressing one finger to judicious lips like oedipus. your name, i said,i have it now: despair— shrieking, it vanished with brimstone and flames. so i etched harmless in that ground of merds and moss and to this day, my people listen to strangers crying wares with an intelligent ear, remembering our grave old danger.

 he was touched or he touched or she did and was, or they were and would. or the room could, its three doors, two windows or  the house on a slant touching, touched by the drift down street, cars pressing quick or slowing. all along the town touched a river, the river  the filth falling through it. what was clean— a source pure as rumor—a shore touching lake touched by wind above, and below, a spring. all touch blindly  further water. that blue touching blacker regions in the sea so weirdly solitary, each to under, to every sideways past deeper, where nowhere.  
NEW POEM
 my heart was suspect. wired to an ekg, i walked a treadmill that measured my ebb and flow, tracked isotopes that ploughed my veins, looked for a constancy i’ve hardly ever found. for a month i worried as i climbed the stairs to my office.  the mortality i never believed in was here now.  they say my heart’s ok, just high cholesterol, but i know my heart’s a house someone has broken into, a room you come back to and know some stranger with bad intent has been there and touched all that you love.  you know he can come back.  it’s his call, his house now.

NEW POEM
 with a boil the size of an egg protruding from her right hip, she knows what i must do, and to stall me has locked herself inside the bathroom, bargaining for a way out.  but it’s too late: i’ve seen the oozing wounds stopped up with bits of toilet paper and tape, the scarified pockets that crater the surface of her arms, buttocks, thighs.  a mean fix torched her last vein years ago, and she’s been banging the dope ever since, puncturing her body like a juju doll. she wants to kick, but not now.  i’m not gonna lie to you, she says in a velvet voice. i already know what she’s after: something stronger than local, a few percocet, a shot of demerol before she’ll let me begin.  all i can tell you is, when the abscess finally drains the odor is so foul it’s evil.  and i’m not sure, driving home later that night, still smelling the pallid citrus, whether it’s merely hallucination, the way her memory inhabits me; or if being in that same room, inhaling that same air, made some of her part of me.  and whose veins are these, beginning to twitch?  
NEW POEM
 —norton island, maine for ten days now, two luna moths remain silk-winged and lavish as a double broach pinned beneath the porch light of my cabin. two of them, patinaed that sea-glass green of copper weather vanes nosing the wind, the sun-lit green of rockweed, the lichen’s green scabbing-over of the bouldered shore, the plush green peat that carpets the island, that hushes, sinks then holds a boot print for days, and the sapling-green of new pines sprouting through it. the miraculous green origami of their wings—false eyed, doomed and sensual as the mermaid’s long green fins: a green siren calling from the moonlight.  a green siren calling from the moonlight, from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches that shed, like tiny white decrees, scrolled bark. they emerge from cocoons like greased hinges, all pheromone and wing, instinct and flutter. they rise, hardwired, driven, through the creaking pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog. two luna moths flitting like exotic birds towards only each other and light, in these their final few days, they mate, then starving they wait, inches apart, on my cabin wall to die, to share fully each pure and burning moment. they are, like desire itself, born without mouths. what, if not this, is love?  
NEW POEM
 to look at this fictitious steed you’d think some mixed-up farmer had crossed an eagle with a horse. it carries knights in armor through cloud fields at terrific speed. i wish the hippogriff would take me for a ride. of course it’s not real. but oh, if . . .!  
NEW POEM
 first there was some other order of things never spoken but in dreams of darkest creation.  then there was black earth, lake, the face of light on water. then the thick forest all around that light, and then the human clay whose blood we still carry rose up in us who remember caves with red bison painted in their own blood, after their kind.  a wildness swam inside our mothers, desire through closed eyes, a new child wearing the red, wet mask of birth, delivered into this land already wounded, stolen and burned beyond reckoning.  red is this yielding land turned inside out by a country of hunters with iron, flint and fire. red is the fear that turns a knife back against men, holds it at their throats, and they cannot see the claw on the handle, the animal hand that haunts them from some place inside their blood.  so that is hunting, birth, and one kind of death. then there was medicine, the healing of wounds. red was the infinite fruit of stolen bodies. the doctors wanted to know what invented disease how wounds healed from inside themselves how life stands up in skin, if not by magic.  they divined the red shadows of leeches that swam in white bowls of water: they believed stars in the cup of sky. they cut the wall of skin to let what was bad escape but they were reading the story of fire gone out and that was a science.  as for the animal hand on death’s knife, knives have as many sides as the red father of war who signs his name in the blood of other men.  and red was the soldier who crawled through a ditch of human blood in order to live. it was the canal of his deliverance. it is his son who lives near me. red is the thunder in our ears when we meet. love, like creation, is some other order of things.  red is the share of fire i have stolen from root, hoof, fallen fruit. and this was hunger.  red is the human house i come back to at night swimming inside the cave of skin that remembers bison. in that round nation of blood we are all burning, red, inseparable fires the living have crawled and climbed through in order to live so nothing will be left for death at the end.  this life in the fire, i love it. i want it, this life.  
NEW POEM
 from sonnets, third series  v  how well do i recall that walk in state across the common, by the paths we knew: myself in silver badge and riband blue, my little sister with her book and slate; the elm tree by the pond, the fence of wood, the burial place that at the corner stood where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate, the stones that grudg’d us way, the graveside weed, the ominous wind that turned us half about. smit the flying drops, at what a speed across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven we hurried homeward when the day was late and heard, with awe that left no place for doubt, god’s anger mutter in the darkened heaven.  
NEW POEM
 when my wife was breaking apart, my son was falling in love.  she lay on the couch with a heated sack of rice on her belly, sometimes dozing, sometimes staring out the window at the olive tree  as it broke into tiny white blossoms, as it swelled into bitter black fruit.  at first, i wanted to spare him. i wished he was still farming up north, tucking bulbs of green onions into their beds and watering the lettuce, his hands gritty, his head haloed in a straw hat.  but as the months deepened, i grew selfish.  i wanted him here with his new love. when i passed the open bathroom door, i wanted to see them brushing their teeth,  one perched on the toilet lid, one on the side of the tub, laughing and talking through their foamy mouths, toothbrushes rattling against their teeth.  like sage gives its scent when you crush it. like stone is hard. they were happy and i could touch it.  
NEW POEM
 i remember nights of playing lotería w/mom &amp; big manny as a way to learn the spanish they spoke to each other but not to their kids who caught on to certain words like cállate,cerveza,chicharrón; little nuggets i ate up like the pinto beans we used instead of the blue chips mom kept in her bingo bag she carried every friday night when her &amp; tia shirley went to the moose lodge, her hair &amp; coat reeking w/the smoke of all who lost.  i remember el borracho, the man always holding a bottle &amp; about to fall over yet never does like big manny stumbling home late at night after a payday, breath &amp; belly full of beer, who one time took a piss in our bedroom.  i remember la garza, not for the heron it is but cousin tony &amp; his kids, nights of sleepovers &amp; pizza, playstation on a 40-inch tv, the night he &amp; lil jesse sneaked bumps of coke in the bathroom &amp; i rubbed numb my teenage teeth.  i remember el musico, not the chubby man clutching his guitarra but my brother dave loading crates of records &amp; a dual turntable case like a coffin into the back of a van, the same set i hit my back on at ten when i fell out of the top bunk bed.  but i prefer to remember la sirena back when her breasts were free of the seashells she now holds to cover them in water so blue cold, her scales so red, her name clung to the tongue like dulce de leche.  
NEW POEM
 i saw in louisiana a live-oak growing, all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches, without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green, and its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself, but i wonder’d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for i knew i could not, and i broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss, and brought it away, and i have placed it in sight in my room, it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends, (for i believe lately i think of little else than of them,) yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love; for all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in louisiana solitary in a wide flat space, uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near, i know very well i could not.  
NEW POEM
 so fallen! so lost! the light withdrawn which once he wore! the glory from his gray hairs gone forevermore!  revile him not, the tempter hath a snare for all; and pitying tears, not scorn and wrath, befit his fall!  oh, dumb be passion’s stormy rage, when he who might have lighted up and led his age, falls back in night.  scorn! would the angels laugh, to mark a bright soul driven, fiend-goaded, down the endless dark, from hope and heaven!  let not the land once proud of him insult him now, nor brand with deeper shame his dim, dishonored brow.  but let its humbled sons, instead, from sea to lake, a long lament, as for the dead, in sadness make.  of all we loved and honored, naught save power remains; a fallen angel’s pride of thought, still strong in chains.  all else is gone; from those great eyes the soul has fled: when faith is lost, when honor dies, the man is dead!  then, pay the reverence of old days to his dead fame; walk backward, with averted gaze, and hide the shame!  
NEW POEM
 no woman wants to be low-hanging fruit, my glamorous girlfriend says, but i’m indiscriminate and love all fruit, i’m tempted to list each kind right here, in and out of season, because even just saying the names gives me pleasure, as does saying your name. i’m not alone with my passion — my whole family, we’re a little off in this regard, we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe or arguing over how many flats to buy when it’s peach-o-rama at the metropolitan. once i even drove half a day to get to pence orchards where i met and took photos of bert pence, who sold me three boxes of peaches at wholesale prices. he was so good to me, as was the late-summer freestone i picked as i walked back through the orchard in the august heat to the entrance gates, which were nothing like the gates of hell. on the contrary, i was in heaven there in yakima. i can still smell that single peach, which was profusely low-hanging, it was the definition of low-hanging, it fell into my hands, as you did — or perhaps as i did into yours — but that was months ago. when i walked past the stands yesterday, on what should have been the first day of spring, all produce had been covered with heavy blankets to keep it warm, to mitigate harm. today the temperature dropped so low someone thought to remove the fruit entirely and stash it away. with this strange weather we’re having, will i see you again? i can’t help myself.  
NEW POEM
 “i have heard (but not believed) the spirits of the dead may walk again.” winter’s tale if spirits walk, love, when the night climbs slow the slant footpath where we were wont to go, be sure that i shall take the self-same way to the hill-crest, and shoreward, down the gray, sheer, gravelled slope, where vetches straggling grow.  look for me not when gusts of winter blow, when at thy pane beat hands of sleet and snow; i would not come thy dear eyes to affray, if spirits walk.  but when, in june, the pines are whispering low, and when their breath plays with thy bright hair so as some one's fingers once were used to play— that hour when birds leave song, and children pray, keep the old tryst, sweetheart, and thou shalt know if spirits walk.

 touching your goodness, i am like a man who turns a letter over in his hand and you might think this was because the hand was unfamiliar but, truth is, the man has never had a letter from anyone; and now he is both afraid of what it means and ashamed because he has no other means to find out what it says than to ask someone.  his uncle could have left the farm to him, or his parents died before he sent them word, or the dark girl changed and want him for beloved. afraid and letter-proud, he keeps it with him. what would you call his feeling for the words that keep him rich and orphaned and beloved?  
NEW POEM
 the image that haunts me is not beautiful. i do not think it will open into a field of wildflowers; i doubt that it will take wing suddenly, startling us into admiration.  it is one of those brutish facts of life, the awkward nakedness of the memory when it takes off its clothes and crawls between the top and bottom sheet. or rather,  it is my mother’s memory that i carry, pressed into my own: how at her grandfather’s funeral, his daughter—my mother’s mother— stood at an open door and cried, and then  the blood ran down her legs, gushing from the womb where thirteen children had nestled, and now, at once horrified and at ease with her body’s impropriety, they gathered all around.  this was the grandmother who lost three of those thirteen, who hung a million baskets of wash, who peeled a million potatoes, and splattered her arms with the grease of constant cooking.  this was my grandmother who kept chickens, who left her voice in the throats of all my aunts, and was struck down in the cellar, legs twisted beneath the fall and half her face stiffened.  helpless until they found her, the jar of canned fruit smashed on the cement. and then at her funeral, i saw my mother’s tears, gliding ahead of me in a black limousine, a procession not beautiful but haunting.  
NEW POEM
 perhaps, this morning, we’re there, normal and soon forgotten, as news is when it’s passed over breakfast, like love, something that’s always cast, too heavy to hold for long. we breathe it in, the bacon, the coffee. we listen to the little quavers as the local tongues, water over rock, rise and fall, like stones skipping soft into the white that smoothed them. the women speak like grandmothers, softly opening their mouths, opening and drawing advice from themselves, like biscuits, and offering in kindness a little more than anyone could ask, more than anyone can take. i know their pitying. it looks like patience, the look on everyone’s faces as the peddler shuffles in his blindness, black hand held open, everyone awaiting the hiss of door, the whisper in everyone’s throats, breaking from patience into pleasure.

 some days i am happy to be no one the shifting grasses  in the may winds are miraculous enough as they ripple through the meadow of lupine  the field as iridescent as a renaissance heaven &amp; do you see that boy with his arms raised  like one of raphael’s angels held within this hush &amp; this pause &amp; the sky’s lapis expanse?  that boy is my son &amp; i am his only father even when i am no one  
NEW POEM
 it’s right before you drive away: our limbs still warm with sleep, coffee sputtering out, the north wind, your hips pressing me hard against the table. i like it hard because i need to remember this. i want to say harder. how we must look to the road that’s gone, to the splayed morning of cold butter and inveterate greed. light comes and goes in the field. oranges in a bowl, garlic, radio. in the story of us, no one wins. isolation is a new theme someone says. by now i’ve invented you. most people don’t like to touch dead things. that’s what my friend tells me when i find my fish on the floor. it must have wanted an out. sometimes my desire scares me. sometimes i watch football and think: four chances is enough to get there. but we don’t have helmets. i want to say harder, i can take it, but there’s no proof i can.

 what seemed a mystery was in fact a choice. insert bird for sorrow.  what seemed a memory was in fact a dividing line. insert bird for wind.  insert wind for departure when everyone is standing still. insert three mountains  burning and in three valleys a signal seer seeing a distant light and a signal bearer  sprinting to a far-off bell. what seemed a promise was in fact a sigh.  what seemed a hot wind, a not quite enough, a forgive me, it has flown away, is in fact.  in the meantime we paint the floors red. we stroke the sound of certain names  into a fine floss that drifts across our teeth. we stay in the room we share and listen  all night to what drifts through the window— dog growl, owl call, a fleet of mosquitoes  setting sail, and down the road, the swish of tomorrow’s donkey-threshed grain.

 a sentimental curator has placed two fragments of bronze grecian heads together boy  and girl so that the faces black- ened by the three thousand years of desert sand &amp; sun  seem to be whispering something that the gurgan lion &amp; the wing- ed dog of azerbaijan  must not hear but i have heard them as i hear you now half way around the world  so simply &amp; so quietly more like a child than like a woman making love say to me in  that soft lost near and distant voice i’m happy now i’m happy oh don’t move don’t go away.

 i scratch earth around timpsila on this hill, while below me, hanging in still air, a hawk searches the creekbed for my brothers. squat leaves, i’ll braid your roots into such long ropes, they’ll cover the rump of my stallion. withered flower, feed us now buffalo rot in the waist-high grass.  hear my sisters laugh? they dream of feasts, of warriors to owl dance with them when this war is over. they don’t see our children eating treebark, cornstalks, these roots. their eyes gleam in shallow cheeks. the wagon people do not think relationship is wealth.  sisters, last night the wind returned my prayer, allowing me to hear dog soldiers singing at ash hollow. i threw away my blanket stained with lies. above the wings of my tipi, i heard the old woman in maka sica sigh for us. then i knew the distance of high back bone’s death- fire from another world away. even they may never stop its motion.  yesterday at noon, i heard my cheyenne sister moan as she waded through deep snow before soldiers cut up her corpse to sell as souvenirs. are my brothers here? ghosts bring all my joy. i walk this good road between rock and sky. they dare not threaten with death one already dead.  
NEW POEM
 and now the green household is dark. the half-moon completely is shining on the earth-lighted tops of the trees. to be dead, a house must be still. the floor and the walls wave me slowly; i am deep in them over my head. the needles and pine cones about me  are full of small birds at their roundest, their fists without mercy gripping hard down through the tree to the roots to sing back at light when they feel it. we lie here like angels in bodies, my brothers and i, one dead, the other asleep from much living,  in mid-air huddled beside me. dark climbed to us here as we climbed up the nails i have hammered all day through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder of broom handles, crate slats, and laths foot by foot up the trunk to the branches where we came out at last over lakes  of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth that move with the moves of the spirit. each nail that sustains us i set here; each nail in the house is now steadied by my dead brother’s huge, freckled hand. through the years, he has pointed his hammer up into these limbs, and told us  that we must ascend, and all lie here. step after step he has brought me, embracing the trunk as his body, shaking its limbs with my heartbeat, till the pine cones danced without wind and fell from the branches like apples. in the arm-slender forks of our dwelling  i breathe my live brother’s light hair. the blanket around us becomes as solid as stone, and it sways. with all my heart, i close the blue, timeless eye of my mind. wind springs, as my dead brother smiles and touches the tree at the root;  a shudder of joy runs up the trunk; the needles tingle; one bird uncontrollably cries. the wind changes round, and i stir within another’s life. whose life? who is dead? whose presence is living? when may i fall strangely to earth,  who am nailed to this branch by a spirit? can two bodies make up a third? to sing, must i feel the world’s light? my green, graceful bones fill the air with sleeping birds. alone, alone and with them i move gently. i move at the heart of the world.  
NEW POEM
 i can love both fair and brown, her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays, her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays, her whom the country formed, and whom the town, her who believes, and her who tries, her who still weeps with spongy eyes, and her who is dry cork, and never cries; i can love her, and her, and you, and you, i can love any, so she be not true.  will no other vice content you? will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers? or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others? or doth a fear that men are true torment you? o we are not, be not you so; let me, and do you, twenty know. rob me, but bind me not, and let me go. must i, who came to travail thorough you, grow your fixed subject, because you are true?  venus heard me sigh this song, and by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore, she heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more. she went, examined, and returned ere long, and said, alas! some two or three poor heretics in love there be, which think to ’stablish dangerous constancy. but i have told them, since you will be true, you shall be true to them who are false to you.  
NEW POEM
 a rectangular bulova, my zadie called a dress watch, i wore it for years, and though it gave the wrong time i treasured the sense of community it offered, the beauty of certain numerals — the seven especially, the way it leaned into its subtle work and never changed, and signified exactly what it was and no more. in dreams i learned that only the watch and the circle of ash trees surrounding me, and the grass prodding my bare feet, and of course my nakedness were necessary, though common. just surrendering my youth, i still believed everything in dreams meant something i could parse to discover who we were.  as i write these words  in sepia across a lined page i have no idea why they’ve taken the shape i’ve given them, some cursive, some not, some elegantly articulated, others plain, many of no use at all. they go on working as best they can, like the parker 51 that spent its coming of age stumbling backwards into yiddish or the bulova that finally threw up its twin baroque arms in surrender to the infinite and quit without a word. the parker still works and is never to blame. on good days it works better than i, and when it leaks it leaks only ink, never a word best left unsaid. as a boy i would steal  into zadie’s bedroom, find the watch in a velvet box, wind it, hold it to each ear — back then both worked — to hear its music, the jeweled wheels and axles that kept time alive. there is still such joy in these tokens from back of beyond: the watch, the parker pen, the tiny pocket knife he used to separate truth from lies, the ivory cigarette holder — a gift, he claimed, from fdr who mistook him for a famous russian violinist. i could call them “infinite riches in a little room” or go cosmic and regard them as fragments of a great mystery instead of what they are, amulets against nothing.  
NEW POEM
 the inside out mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins, muscles, the bits of fat at her belly, her small gray spleen. at first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside, she's the ultimate open book. he can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp; ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she's lying; poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm. no need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood. he just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder. but before long, she starts to sense that her lover, like all the others before him, is getting restless. this is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world, the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness. as a last resort, she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. but eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is. her perfect skin. her long black hair. her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here.  
NEW POEM
 invisible fish swim this ghost ocean now described by waves of sand, by water-worn rock. soon the fish will learn to walk. then humans will come ashore and paint dreams on the dying stone. then later, much later, the ocean floor will be punctuated by chevy trucks, carrying the dreamers’ decendants, who are going to the store.  
NEW POEM
 señora, it is true the greeks are dead.  it is true also that we here are americans: that we use the machines: that a sight of the god is unusual: that more people have more thoughts: that there are  progress and science and tractors and revolutions and marx and the wars more antiseptic and murderous and music in every home: there is also hoover.  does the lady suggest we should write it out in the word? does madame recall our responsibilities? we are whores, fräulein: poets, fräulein, are persons of  known vocation following troops: they must sleep with stragglers from either prince and of both views. the rules permit them to further the business of neither.  it is also strictly forbidden to mix in maneuvers. those that infringe are inflated with praise on the plazas— their bones are resultantly afterwards found under newspapers.  preferring life with the sons to death with the fathers, we also doubt on the record whether the sons will still be shouting around with the same huzzas—  for we hope lady to live to lie with the youngest. there are only a handful of things a man likes, generation to generation, hungry or  well fed: the earth’s one: life’s one: mister morgan is not one.  there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style.  he that goes naked goes further at last than another. wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they’ll jimmy his door down and be thick in his bed—for a month:  (who recalls the address now of the imagists?) but the naked man has always his own nakedness. people remember forever his live limbs.  they may drive him out of the camps but one will take him. they may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope’s argument— he will lie in a house and be warm when they are shaking.  besides, tovarishch, how to embrace an army? how to take to one’s chamber a million souls? how to conceive in the name of a column of marchers?  the things of the poet are done to a man alone as the things of love are done—or of death when he hears the step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick only.  neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near him there where he lies on his left arm and will die, nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is jeering  and his knee’s in the soft of the bed where his love lies.  i remind you, barinya, the life of the poet is hard— a hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver:  is it just to demand of us also to bear arms?  
NEW POEM
 i know that i shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above; those that i fight i do not hate, those that i guard i do not love; my country is kiltartan cross, my countrymen kiltartan’s poor, no likely end could bring them loss or leave them happier than before. nor law, nor duty bade me fight, nor public men, nor cheering crowds, a lonely impulse of delight drove to this tumult in the clouds; i balanced all, brought all to mind, the years to come seemed waste of breath, a waste of breath the years behind in balance with this life, this death.

 i dream of jeanie with the light brown hair, borne, like a vapor, on the summer air; i see her tripping where the bright streams play, happy as the daisies that dance on her way. many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour. many were the blithe birds that warbled them o’er: oh! i dream of jeanie with the light brown hair, floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.  i long for jeanie with the daydawn smile, radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile; i hear her melodies, like joys gone by, sighing round my heart o’er the fond hopes that die:— sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,— wailing for the lost one that comes not again: oh! i long for jeanie, and my heart bows low, never more to find her where the bright waters flow.  i sigh for jeanie, but her light form strayed far from the fond hearts round her native glade; her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown, flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone. now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore while her gentle fingers will cull them no more: oh! i sigh for jeanie with the light brown hair, floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

 continue to pour my thoughts out on this topic of discussion slow down, i keep gettin the feeling that i’m rushin like my cousin’s dying breaths, or the decision that was made but lemme backtrack, letting feelings get in the way a normal adolescent, aspiring for the highest goals that were attainable, wanted to be the flyest we all searchin for something we’ve made a pact to do the drive of ambition, it’s in us, it’s in you now snatch every dream that a mother had for her son and replace that with a breath, “baby, just take another one!” a white man’s gun, the very courier of evil he left, enjoyed his night, but the gunshots were lethal deceitful, everything we’ve been told from the start we’ve more than just some ghetto thugs, these thoughts split us apart what you must understand is our culture bore from oppression the hip hop inside of us a form of expression i wish i had the chance to explain to jordan’s killer that the song “beef” by lil reese shouldn’t label him a dealer or is he ignorant or another ghetto thug? do you understand that your ignorance filled him with 3 slugs? i don’t want sympathy and i don’t want affection i want this country to head in the right direction instead of discussin who the grammys should be awardin work to prevent murders like those of my cousin, jordan.

 october, 1918 across a world where all men grieve and grieving strive the more, the great days range like tides and leave our dead on every shore. heavy the load we undergo, and our own hands prepare, if we have parley with the foe, the load our sons must bear.  before we loose the word that bids new worlds to birth, needs must we loosen first the sword of justice upon earth; or else all else is vain since life on earth began, and the spent world sinks back again hopeless of god and man.  a people and their king through ancient sin grown strong, because they feared no reckoning would set no bound to wrong; but now their hour is past, and we who bore it find evil incarnate held at last to answer to mankind.  for agony and spoil of nations beat to dust, for poisoned air and tortured soil and cold, commanded lust, and every secret woe the shuddering waters saw— willed and fulfilled by high and low— let them relearn the law:  that when the dooms are read, not high nor low shall say:— "my haughty or my humble head has saved me in this day." that, till the end of time, their remnant shall recall their fathers' old, confederate crime availed them not at all:  that neither schools nor priests, nor kings may build again a people with the heart of beasts made wise concerning men. whereby our dead shall sleep in honour, unbetrayed, and we in faith and honour keep that peace for which they paid.

 my mother has taken me to paddington station. we are inside a whale.  my father sleeps all day. when he wakes the cloisters come for him.  my sister can sit on her hair. at night, a man sits on her bed. her bed is covered in oak leaves.  the sleeves of my mother’s kaftan trail in the dirt. we keep forgetting it’s not her.  the telephone bursts from the wall. the wires are a joke. we get it.

 pale hands i loved beside the shalimar, where are you now? who lies beneath your spell? whom do you lead on rapture's roadway, far, before you agonise them in farewell?  oh, pale dispensers of my joys and pains, holding the doors of heaven and of hell, how the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins, beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.  pale hands, pink tipped, like lotus buds that float on those cool waters where we used to dwell, i would have rather felt you round my throat, crushing out life, than waving me farewell!

 and i will bend down to smell his desire his tomb's flowers and marble his wilting joy his swapping temptation for content  and i will keep him from the cold, visitors, oleander, and the sons of bitches and say: no one will resemble me like my father his white stumbling and the illusion that plucks words  a shout that walks on two feeble legs eyes me with the summer of discontent and sprinkles me with water, turns me green before it shakes the bitter dirt off its fingers … that's my father he cried from a darkness in the grave  and i will gather the house of your chucked absence as if we were alone on earth … you die so i can fold the falcon's wings after its departure and believe the silence that remains

 listen to the radio play joe, a doctoral candidate in literature rachel, his fiancée poet/critic  scene 1  poet: again like a rebellious nation my heart stands and cries: forward, to the battle! to the battle? now? what's a battle to an old man like me. o barricades of washed-up words, stanzas filling books with my heart's murmurs, my love is lined with lies and sweetened with the sweetest white sugar. my thoughts are rusty, my feelings but smoky furniture and scraps of youthful rage gone by. all this, piled on the barricades. but whither my flag, my withering flag? spring is in my heart again and winter in my eyes, fall in my arms and frost in my toes. o desire, o vain rebellion, what more . . . [the voice fades into the background.]  joe:   this is the end. this is the end. [we hear knocks at the door.] this is the end. this is the end. [rachel enters as joe continues grumbling.]  rachel: joe, joe, what's with you?  joe:   this is the end. [we hear him furiously tearing newspaper.] the end! the end! the end! the end!  rachel: [anxiously.] what's wrong with you? the end of what? what happened? good god. i have never . . .  joe: [apathetically.] this is the end. read the newspaper.  rachel: which newspaper? where?  joe: there, that ball, that ball of paper. [rachel opens it.] well read it!  rachel: one moment. you've torn and crumpled it . . . hold on . . . this is a   serious act of archaeological reconstruction.  joe: come on, read it out loud!  rachel: . . . and frost in my toes. o desire, o vain rebellion, what more do i ask? o dark desperation in a tenebrous valley like a ship of ghosts. but behold! what is that light on the horizon, yonder as if from a distant cave? my legs fail me, yet my heart soaks up hope like a big sponge in the bathtub.  [she laughs.] a big sponge in the bathtub!  joe: go on. go on.  rachel: [a little hurt.] fine, fine, stop rushing me . . . one moment, one moment . . . it's hard to make out . . . ok:  three maidens sit in that cave weaving my fate. spin-spin on the spindle, no not on the spindle, no. they crouch over books by lamplight. the students. how studious! till dawn breaks they study and maybe read my poems of yore.  joe: go on!  rachel: slowly i'll sneak through the rustling summer grass and watch, struck with awe. there is a window ancient, arched, and there she sits with her hand stroking the hair of her . . . head. o, my studious one, i begged to see you, only to see, not to touch, not to sit in your room, only to know your name, to call your name, o your name, your name and your name and your name. i'll peep stealthily . . .  enough, i can't read anymore.  joe: do you know what this means?  rachel: i know.  joe:   the end of my glorious dissertation. the end of the literature department's rising star. i'll remain a teaching assistant forever. i might as well go back to the army.  rachel: i won't let you, i love you.  joe:   so what? i'll sit and start writing on a new subject. come to me in four years when i'm done . . .  rachel: you're out of your mind.  joe:   . . . only to discover, like sisyphus, that it was all for naught. [despairingly.] what an idiot! and just yesterday i wrote the final chapter! [sarcastically.] here, look, the dissertation that will revolutionize the appreciation of d.g. castleman's poetry.  rachel: [sweetly.] and i drew the letters on the cover: "d.g. castleman's poetry and its interpretation."  joe:   the long silence of d.g. castleman . . .

 xxii  1  this is a slight stiff dance to a waking baby whose arms have been lying curled back above his head upon the pillow, making a flower—the eyes closed. dead to the world! waking is a little hand brushing away dreams. eyes open. here’s a new world.  _______________  there is nothing the sky-serpent will not eat. sometimesit stops to gnaw fujiyama, sometimes to slip its long andsoftly clasping tongue about the body of a sleeping childwho smiles thinking its mother is lifting it.  2 security, solidity—we laugh at them in our clique. it is tobacco to us, this side of her leg. we put it in our samovar and make tea of it. you see the stuff has possibilities. you think you are opposing the rich but the truth is you’re turning toward authority yourself, to say nothing of religion. no, i do not say it means nothing. why everything is nicely adjusted to our moods. but i would rather describe to you what i saw in the kitchen last night—overlook the girl a moment: there over the sink (1) this saucepan holds all, (2) this colander holds most, (3) this wire sieve lets most go and (4) this funnel holds nothing. you appreciate the progression. what need then to be always laughing? quit phrase making—that is, not of course—but you will understand me or if not—why—come to breakfast sometime around evening on the fourth of january any year you please; always be punctual where eating is concerned.  ________________ my little son’s improvisations exceed min: a round stoneto him’s a loaf of bread or “this hen could lay a dozengolden eggs.” birds fly about his bedstead; giants lean overhim with hungry jaws; bears roam the farm by summerand are killed and quartered at a thought. there are interminable stories at eating time full of bizarre imagery,true grotesques, pigs that change to dogs in the telling,cows that sing, roosters that become mountains and oceansthat fill a soup plate. there are groans and growls, dunclouds and sunshine mixed in a huge phantasmagoria thatnever rests, never ceased to unfold into—the day’s poorlittle happenings. not that alone. he has music which ihave not. his tunes follow no scale, no rhythm—alone themood in odd ramblings up and down, over and over witha rigor of invention that rises beyond the power to followexcept in some more obvious flight. never have i heard socrushing a critique as those desolate inventions, involvedhalf-hymns, after his first visit to a christian sunday school.  3  this song is to phyllis! by this deep snow i know it’s springtime, not ring time! good god no! the screaming brat’s a sheep bleating, the rattling crib-side sheep shaking a bush. we are young! we are happy! says colin. what’s an icy room and the sun not up? this song is to phyllis. reproduction lets death in, says joyce. rot, say i. to phyllis this song is!  ________________ that which is known has value only by virtue of thedark. this cannot be otherwise. a thing known passes outof the mind into the muscles, the will is quit of it, saveonly when set into vibration by the forces of darknessopposed to it.

 is it because your sable hair is folded over brows that wear at times a too imperial air;  or is it that the thoughts which rise in those dark orbs do seek disguise beneath the lids of eastern eyes;  that choose whatever pose or place may chance to please, in you i trace the noblest women of your race?  the crowd is sauntering at its ease, and humming like a hive of bees— you take your seat and touch the keys.  i do not hear the giddy throng; the sea avenges israel’s wrong, and on the wind floats miriam’s song!  you join me with a stately grace; music to poesy gives place; some grand emotion lights your face.  at once i stand by mizpeh’s walls; with smiles the martyred daughter falls, and desolate are mizpeh’s halls!  intrusive babblers come between; with calm, pale brow and lofty mien, you thread the circle like a queen!  then sweeps the royal esther by; the deep devotion in her eye is looking “if i die, i die!”  you stroll the garden’s flowery walks; the plants to me are grainless stalks, and ruth to old naomi talks.  adopted child of judah’s creed, like judah’s daughters, true at need, i see you mid the alien seed.  i watch afar the gleaner sweet; i wake like boaz in the wheat, and find you lying at my feet!  my feet! oh! if the spell that lures my heart through all these dreams endures, how soon shall i be stretched at yours!

 we visit by phone as the morphine haze retreats, late afternoon, most days. our mingled past is set against the pin- hole lights of cars cruising the blacked-out streets:  we four in the college smoker popping no-doz, honors students carrying heavy course loads tipped sideways by sex, one by one discarding our virginities on the altar of inverse pride,  ironing our blouses with peter pan collars to wear on dates with those 90-day wonders, ensigns in training for the second world war in the business school across the charles river.  we called ourselves the unholy four. whenever any three of us met on campus we huddled to bray austria! russia! prussia! in unison. it came out sounding like horseshit!  post graduation one year, look at us: my new husband atop your even newer one's car singing the bawdy verses of "roll me over" in a drunken tenor  while the scandalized uncles and aunties —it wasn't enough that you'd wed a chinese— wrung their hands. you drove off trailing just married in two languages.  now bj is gone, and hettie. you have, they say, only days. it is my plan to go with you as far as the border. i've been that far— did i come back from there morally improved?  somehow better equipped to support you this side of the douane and wave, your two cats curled like commas beside you as the barrier lifts and you drive on through?

 san josé, costa rica tortillas clap against floured palms, steaming bowls of avena, frijoles black as the rumbling sky, arroz con pollo simmers. against the kitchen  window, small clouds rise. papá dances to the electric beat of the marimba, his cheek bristly against mamá’s neck; his thick fingers sift  through her wispy hair. i am nowhere to be found, neither in the foreground nor background. today i sit in this chair, in the corner of my house, covered with a poncho of blue flowers, looking out at asphalt roads overflowing with rain, fogging the glass. along the road, steam rises like blotchy fingerprints.

 my wife tells me she hears a beetle scurrying across the kitchen floor. she says our daughter is dreaming  too loudly, just listen, her eyelids are fluttering like butterflies.  what about the thunder, i say, what about the dispatches from the police car parked outside, or me rolling over like a whale?  she tells me there’s a leaf falling and grazing the downstairs window, or it could be glass cutters, diamonds, thieves working their hands toward the latch. she tells me our son is breathing too quickly, is it pneumonia, is it the furnace suddenly pumping monoxides through the house?  so when my wife says sleep, she means a closing of the eyes, a tuning of the ears to ultra frequencies.  (it is what always happens when there are children, the bed becoming at night a listening post, each little ting forewarning disaster.)  downstairs there is the sound of something brushing against something else and i try to listen as my wife might listen, insects, i say, dust on a table top, maybe a knife’s edge against the palm.  but she tells me it’s only the african violet on the windowsill putting out another flower, and falls luxuriously into a dream of being awake and vigilant.  so the house grows noisier, there are clicks in the woodwork, there are drips, raps, clunks, things to make sense of, make benign.  my son and daughter are sleeping calmly, and the stairs, yes, are creaking, the wind, i think, or maybe two men, where’s the beaker of acid, the bowling ball, the war hoop i learned in second grade?  so this is what it’s like when there’s no one left but you to love and defend.  outside there are cats in a fight and they remind me too much of babies crying. then the bottle thrown against the stoop, the sound of something delicate shattered.  my wife stirs, be glad, she says, sound doesn’t carry far, that you don’t hear the whole of it, cries in the night, children in other cities, hurts, silences.  and she’s right, i can’t hear the whole of it, or else i hear too much and it’s noise or i make it noise because it’s too much.  so i begin homing in on something around me, something distinct, my wife’s breathing, a window’s rattle. outside, grass is lengthening in the dark, and sap running up the phloem of the maple, (do i hear it? and how the stars must be wheeling!) and in the far room, my children’s hearts are keeping time, for them, for us who have begun to listen in earnest.

 in the clear light that confuses everything only you, dark laurel, shadow my house,  lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake. and at night, quivering with tears,  you are like the tree called tasso’s. crippled, and hooped with iron, it stands on peter’s hill.  when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity,  that tree makes their own torsion seem natural. and so, they’re comforted.   2 one of the local philosophers ... he says, “in california we have the old anarchist tradition.”  what can he mean? is there an anarchist tradition? and why would an anarchist want one? o california,  is there a tree without opinions? come, let me clasp you! let me feel the idea breathing.  i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts— “the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall.”  like the girls in our neighborhood, they’re beautiful and silent.   3 as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china. a lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other.  i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods. he pointed behind him, and i saw  that the hills were covered with armed men, and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear.  he said, “we are as various as the twigs of a tree, but now the tree moves as one man.  it walks. and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving.”   4 i said, “yet, all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing.  when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear and all the dead we had to,  it was a time of forgetfulness, like a plucked string. it was a river of darkness.  was it not so on your side, when you came to the sea that was covered with ships? let us speak to each other,  let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air. that bird flies over the heads of the armed men.”   5 one part of the tree grows outward. the other i saw when, with a light, i explored the cellar—shattering roots.  they had broken through the wall, as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last.  i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles. these things are the beginning  of things not visible to the naked eye. it was so in the time of tobit— the dish glowed when the angel held it.  it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning.

 those notes are fetching when they touch the ear. it's true, there are more tears in sand than water. "come out and play," the song's refrain in my head, my sawdust showing. my heart, your eyes is what the day made.  there, the notes, the song, the besidedness to live on saturday, to walk out, wanted to, right out the frame. the sadness, gas pumps, sunshine on oil, that crow overhead destroys the picture. everything faking it so badly.  what's so wrong about the real, so off with clarity, dumbfuck, shirttail-hanging scatter-brained word. shattered-pane world?  the whir of the camera inside pictures but we want the voice to lift, don't we, across the mini-plaza to where? how about pulling taffy for a living or a rabbit from one ideal-ology to another. that's the trick isn't it, parallel lives?  you know, here a dumpster there a dane. on the street i see birds, bricks, clouds i see a friend getting into her car i see myself in the puddle i see. and even if we pray to remain unabated, a minor chord can sometimes reconnoiter the most distant thoughts camouflaged in lace and literature.  o western wind let's not decorate the light with roseate diadems, plumbago shadows in the rushes. haven't we heard enough from the birds, their annual trips and cross-talk? listen. the arc of a rocket is louder than a rainbow.

 beloved, men in thick green coats came crunching through the snow, the insignia on their shoulders of uncertain origin, a country i could not be sure of, a salute so terrifying i heard myself lying to avoid arrest, and was arrested along with jocko, whose tear had snapped off, a tiny icicle he put in his mouth. we were taken to the ice prison, a palace encrusted with hoarfrost, its dome lit from within, jocko admired the wiring, he kicked the walls to test the strength of his new boots.  a television stood in a block of ice, its blue image still moving like a liquid center. you asked for my innermost thoughts.  i wonder will i ever see a grape again?  when i think of the vineyard where we met in october—when you dropped a cluster custom insisted you be kissed by a stranger—how after the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms turned pink.  it seemed our future was sealed.  everyone said so.  it is quiet here.  not closing our ranks weakens us hugely.  the snowflakes fall in a featureless bath.  i am the stranger who kissed you.  on sunny days each tree is a glittering chandelier.  the power of mindless beauty!  jocko told a joke and has been dead since may.  a bullethole in his forehead the officers call a third eye.  for a month i milked a barnful of cows.  it is a lot like cleansing a chandelier.  wipe and polish, wipe and polish, round and round you go. i have lost my spectacles.  is the book i was reading still open by the side of our bed?  treat it as a bookmark saving my place in our story.

 esto no es realismo mágico dear martín: in izalco, while christ waits for easter in his glass tomb in the cathedral a single long note is blown on a trumpet en el parque central. los perros flacco forage at the feet of la gente. los poetas mount the stage in a shower of rose petals thrown by old ladies. the mayor opens his arms wide. in the audience are campesinos, hijitos, shopkeepers, viejos, the town trauma surgeon, and a generous contigent of la policia con pistolas, escopetas y m16s. solamente el volcán duerme esta noche. los perros flaccos jump into the big blue garbage cans. martín, you will certainly believe this. each poeta is introduced with a fireworks rocket. los perros flaccos jump out of the big blue garbage cans. poetas de argentina, taiwan, guatemala, españa, peru, nicaragua, france, costa rica, brazil, venezuela, chile, y los estados unidas open their mouths. out come pajaros, serpientes, y duendes, hombres, mujeres, y alquimistas with flasks of aether; out come revolutionaries in diapers, ambassadors in limousines of obsidian, the virgin in a madonna t-shirt, y los indios with flutes made of thigh bones and bombs made of skulls; out come the dead dictators chained together by ectoplasm swinging censors that emit the stink of money, priests with rifles, nuns with giant beasts whose names are forgotten hidden in the musk of their habits; out come conquistadores on roller skates, moros in black on black motorcycles, mad max with tattoos de los maras salvatruche. when los poetas have finished, there are more fireworks. they are swarmed by hijitos, viejos y otros wanting autographs. their hands are as soft as their hearts. death does not hide here but lives among them dressed in white lace with earrings rattling on her skull. life does not hide here but steps through irony as if it were the vanishing fog.

 the landscape (the landscape!) again: gloucester, the shore one of me is (duplicates), and from which (from offshore, i, maximus) am removed, observe.  in this night i moved on the territory with combinations (new mixtures) of old and known personages: the leader, my father, in an old guise, here selling books and manuscripts.  my thought was, as i looked in the window of his shop, there should be materials here for maximus, when, then, i saw he was the young musician has been there (been before me)  before. it turned out it wasn’t a shop, it was a loft (wharf- house) in which, as he walked me around, a year ago came back (i had been there before, with my wife and son,  i didn’t remember, he presented me insinuations via himself and his girl) both of whom i had known for years. but never in gloucester. i had moved them in, to my country.  his previous appearance had been in my parents’ bedroom where i found him intimate with my former wife: this boy was now the librarian of gloucester, massachusetts!   black space, old fish-house. motions of ghosts. i, dogging his steps. he (not my father, by name himself with his face twisted at birth) possessed of knowledge pretentious giving me what in the instant i knew better of.  but the somber place, the flooring crude like a wharf’s and a barn’s space   i was struck by the fact i was in gloucester, and that my daughter was there—that i would see her! she was over the cut. i hadn’t even connected her with my being there, that she was  here. that she was there (in the promised land—the cut! but there was this business, of poets, that all my jews were in the fish-house too, that the librarian had made a party  i was to read. they were. there were many of them, slumped around. it was not for me. i was outside. it was the fort. the fort was in east gloucester—old gorton’s wharf, where the library  was. it was a region of coal houses, bins. in one a gang was beating someone to death, in a corner of the labyrinth of fences. i could see their arms and shoulders whacking  down. but not the victim. i got out of there. but cops tailed me along the fort beach toward the tavern  the places still half-dark, mud, coal dust.  there is no light east of the bridge  only on the headland toward the harbor from cressy’s  have i seen it (once when my daughter ran out on a spit of sand  isn’t even there.) where is bristow? when does i-a get me home? i am caught  in gloucester.

 1  against the low, new york state mountain background, a smokestack sticks up and gives out its snakelike wisp. thin, stripped win- ter birches pick up the vertical lines. last night we five watched the white, painted upright bars of steel in an ancient, new york jail called herkimer (named for a general who lost an arm). cops threw us against the car. their marks grow gaudy over me. they burgeon beneath my clothes. i know i give my wound too much thought and time. gallows loomed outside our sorry solitary cells. “you are in the oldest of our new york jails,” they said. “and we’ve been in books. it’s here they had one of dreiser’s characters arraigned.” the last one of our company to be hanged we found had chopped her husband up and fed him to the hungry swine. they nudged the wan- ing warmth of his flesh. each gave him a rooting touch, translating his dregs into the hopes of pigs. and now with their spirited wish and with his round, astonished face, her changed soul still floats about over their small farm near this little new york town.   2  the door bangs shut in the absolute dark. toilets flush with a great force, and i can hear the old, gentle drunk, my neighbor in the tank, hawk his phlegm and fart. in the early day we line up easily as a cliché for our bread and bowls of gruel. we listen, timeless, for the courthouse bell, play rummy the whole day long and “shoot the moon,” go to bed and jack off to calm down, and scowl harshly, unmanned, at those who were once our friends. the prison of our skins now rises outside and drops in vertical lines before our very eyes.   3  outdoors again, now we can walk to the erie locks (“highest lift locks in the world!”) the old iron bridge has a good bed— cobbles made of wood. things pass through this town everywhere for it was built in opposite tiers. two levels of roads on either side the canal, then two terraces of tracks and higher ranks of beds: roads where trucks lumber awkwardly above the town— like those heavy golden cherubim that try to wing about in the old, baroque church. the little town—with its gothic brick bank, victorian homes with gingerbread frieze and its blasted factories (collapsed, roofs roll- ing back from walls like the lids of eyes)— has died and given up its substance like a hollow duct, smokestack or a pen through which the living stuff flows on.   4  so we walk the long, dead-end track along the shallow, frozen lake where the canal forms a fork (this time of year the locks don’t work). and now and again we look back, for the troopers haunt the five of us out the ledges toward the locks. (we know they want to hose our bellies and our backs. or—as they said— “play the mambo” on our heads.) we do not yet feel quite free— though the blue and yellow, newly painted posts for ships bloom gaily in the cold, and the bulbs about their bases bulge for spring. soon the great, iron gates will open out and the first woman-shaped ship, mammoth, silent, will float toward us like a god come back to make us feel only half afraid. until then, though my friends will be gone from this dry channel of snow and stone, i’ll stay here among the monuments of sheer, brown and gray rock where you can read the names of lovers, sailors and of kids etched in chalk, and in this winter air still keep one hand over my aching ear.  buffalo, march 1967

 each morning in the little white cabin by the river they woke to a raccoon clawing under the floorboards or banging in the wood stove. they did not discuss this. instead they said it was a perfect day to pick blueberries on the hill, or that a hike to the old glassworks sounded good. they were beginning to speak not in meat but in the brown paper the butcher wraps around it. brown paper around dirty magazines. like dirty magazines, they only traced the contour of substance: silk over skin, skin over muscle, muscle over bone. what's under bone? marrow? their forks so small and dull. as if for dolls. you can tell dolls from animals because the latter are made of meat. many eat it, also. lions are interesting. lions don't eat the flesh of their kills right away, but first lap up the blood, until the meat is blanched nearly white. white as the little cabin by the river they stayed in that summer. white as the raccoon covered in ashes, his black eyes bottomless and bright with hate.

 as we drove back, crossing the hill, the house still hidden in the trees, i always thought— a fool’s fear—that it might have caught fire, someone could have broken in. as if things must have been too good here. still, we always found it locked tight, safe and sound.  i mentioned that, once, as a joke; no doubt we spoke of the absurdity to fear some dour god’s jealousy of our good fortune. from the farm next door, our neighbors saw no harm came to the things we cared for here. what did we have to fear?  maybe i should have thought: all such things rot, fall— barns, houses, furniture. we two are stronger than we were apart; we’ve grown together. everything we own can burn; we know what counts—some such idea. we said as much.  we’d watched friends driven to betray; felt that love drained away some self they need. we’d said love, like a growth, can feed on hate we turn in and disguise; we warned ourselves. that you might despise me—hate all we both loved best— none of us ever guessed.  the house still stands, locked, as it stood untouched a good two years after you went. some things passed in the settlement; some things slipped away. enough’s left that i come back sometimes. the theft and vandalism were our own. maybe we should have known.

 you could figure it as a trapdoor, blur of hinge and down into the unconscious of this stranger moving around your garden like a trap— making all the greens unstable as the warble of nausea come bang up to greet you. bang to rights is how he'd like to have your house. cuckoo, wool-wearing garden-dweller, new-age salvationist, holy among your cow-parsley and roses. meanwhile, the unaccustomed heat. meanwhile, a sky tunnelling upward— sense of proportion—golden section of elder hedge; then the disgraceful paddock gone wild.  
NEW POEM
 i. children's arms  on my way home i pass a cameraman on a platform on the bumper of a car inside which, rolling and plunging, a comedian is working; on one white lot i see a star stumble to her igloo through the howling gale of the wind machines. on melrose a dinosaur and pterodactyl, with their immense pale papier-mâché smiles, look over the fence of the lost world. whispering to myself the tale these shout—done with my schoolwork, i commence my real life: my arsenal, my workshop opens, and in impotent omnipotence i put on the helmet and the breastplate pop cut out and soldered for me. here is the shield i sawed from beaver board and painted; here on top the bow that only odysseus can wield and eleven vermilion-ringed, goose-feathered arrows. (the twelfth was broken on the battlefield when, searching among snap beans and potatoes, i stepped on it.) some dry weeds, a dead cane are my spears. the knife on the bureau's my throwing-knife; the small unpainted biplane without wheels—that so often, helped by human hands, has taken off from, landed on, the counterpane— is my spad. o dead list, that misunderstands and laughs at and lies about the new live wild loves it lists! that sets upright, in the sands of age in which nothing grows, where all our friends are old, a few dried leaves marked this is the greenwood— o arms that arm, for a child's wars, the child!  and yet they are good, if anything is good, against his enemies . . . across the seas at the bottom of the world, where childhood sits on its desert island with achilles and pitamakan, the white blackfoot: in the black auditorium, my heart at ease, i watch the furred castaways (the seniors put a play on every spring) tame their wild beasts, erect their tree house. chatting over their fruit, their coconuts, they relish their stately feasts. the family's servant, their magnanimous master now, rules them by right. nature's priests, they worship at nature's altar; when with decorous affection the admirable crichton kisses a girl like a big wendy, all of us squirm or sit up in our seats . . . undone when an english sail is sighted, the prisoners escape from their eden to the world: the real one where servants are servants, masters masters, and no one's magnanimous. the lights go on and we go off, robbed of our fruit, our furs— the island that the children ran is gone.  the island sang to me:believe! believe! and didn't i know a lady with a lion? each evening, as the sun sank, didn't i grieve to leave my tree house for reality? there was nothing there for me to disbelieve. at peace among my weapons, i sit in my tree and feel:friday night, then saturday, then sunday!  i'm dreaming of a wolf, as mama wakes me, and a tall girl who is–outside it's gray, i can't remember, i jump up and dress. we eat in the lighted kitchen. and what is play for me, for them is habit. happiness is a quiet presence, breathless and familiar: my grandfather and i sit there in oneness as the sunset bus, lit by the lavender and rose of sunrise, takes us to the dark echoing cavern where pop, a worker, works for our living. as he rules a mark, a short square pencil in his short square hand, on a great sheet of copper, i make some remark he doesn't hear. in that hard maze—in that land that grown men live in—in the world of work, he measures, shears, solders; and i stand empty-handed, watching him. i wander into the murk the naked light bulbs pierce: the workmen, making something, say something to the boy in his white shirt. i jerk as the sparks fly at me. the man hammering as acid hisses, and the solder turns to silver, seems to me a dwarf hammering out the ring in the world under the world. the hours blur; bored and not bored, i bend things out of lead. i wash my smudged hands, as my grandfather washes his black ones, with their gritty soap: ahead, past their time clock, their pay window, is the blue and gold and white of noon. the sooty thread up which the laborers feel their way into their wives and houses, is money; the fact of life, the secret the grown-ups share, is what to do to make money. the husband adam, eve his wife have learned how not to have to do without till santa claus brings them their boy scout knife— nor do they find things in dreams, carry a paper route, sell christmas seals . . . starting his saturday, his sunday, pop tells me what i love to hear about, his boyhood in shelbyville. i play what he plays, hunt what he hunts, remember what he remembers: it seems to me i could stay in that dark forest, lit by one fading ember of his campfire, forever . . . but we're home. i run in love to each familiar member of this little state, clustered about the dome of st. nicholas—this city in which my rabbit depends on me, and i on everyone—this first rome of childhood, so absolute in every habit that when we hear the world our jailor say: "tell me, art thou a roman ?" the time we inhabit drops from our shoulders, and we answer: "yea. i stand at caesar's judgment seat, i appeal unto caesar." i wash my hands, pop gives his pay envelope to mama; we sit down to our meal. the phone rings: mrs. mercer wonders if i'd care to go to the library. that would be ideal, i say when mama lets me. i comb my hair and find the four books i have out:the food of the gods was best. liking that world where the children eat, and grow giant and good, i swear as i've often sworn: "i'll never forget what it's like, when i've grown up." a prelude by chopin, hammered note by note, like alphabet blocks, comes from next door. it's played with real feeling, the feeling of being indoors practicing. "and yet it's not as if—" a gray electric, stealing to the curb on silent wheels, has come; and i see on the back seat (sight more appealing than any human sight!) my own friend lucky, half wolf, half police-dog. and he can play the piano— play that he does, that is—and jump so high for a ball that he turns a somersault. "hello," i say to the lady, and hug lucky . . . in my talk with the world, in which it tells me what i know and i tell it, "i know—" how strange that i know nothing, and yet it tells me what i know!— i appreciate the animals, who stand by purring. or else they sit and pant. it's so— so agreeable. if only people purred and panted! so, now, lucky and i sit in our row, mrs. mercer in hers. i take for granted the tiller by which she steers, the yellow roses in the bud vases, the whole enchanted drawing room of our progress. the glass encloses as glass does, a womanish and childish and doggish universe. we press our noses to the glass and wish: the angel- and devilfish floating by on vine, on sunset, shut their eyes and press their noses to their glass and wish.   ii. a night with lions  when i was twelve we'd visit my aunt's friend who owned a lion, the metro-goldwyn-mayer lion. i'd play with him, and he'd pretend to play with me. i was the real player but he'd trot back and forth inside his cage till he got bored. i put tawny in the prayer i didn't believe in, not at my age, but said still; just as i did everything in fours and gave to something, on the average, one cookie out of three. and by my quartz, my ores, my wood with the bark on it, from the petrified forest, i put his dewclaw . . . now the lion roars his slow comfortable roars; i lie beside my young, tall, brown aunt, out there in the past or future, and i sleepily confide my dream-discovery: my breath comes fast whenever i see someone with your skin, hear someone with your voice. the lion's steadfast roar goes on in the darkness. i have been asleep a while when i remember: you are—you, and tawny was the lion in— in tarzan. in tarzan! just as we used to, i talk to you, you talk to me or pretend to talk to me as grown-up people do, of jurgen and rupert hughes, till in the end i think as a child thinks: "you're my real friend."   iii. a street off sunset  sometimes as i drive by the factory that manufactures, after so long, vicks vaporub ointment, there rises over me a eucalyptus tree. i feel its stair-sticks impressed on my palms, my insteps, as i climb to my tree house. the gray leaves make me mix my coughing chest, anointed at bedtime, with the smell of the sap trickling from the tan trunk, where the nails go in. my lifetime got rid of, i sit in a dark blue sedan beside my great-grandmother, in hollywood. we pass a windmill, a pink sphinx, an allbran billboard; thinking of salâmmbo, robin hood, the old prospector with his flapjack in the air, i sit with my hands folded: i am good.  that night as i lie crossways in an armchair reading amazing stories(just as, long before, i'd lie by my rich uncle's polar bear on his domed library's reflecting floor in the last year of the first world war, and see a poor two-seater being attacked by four triplanes, on the cover of the literary digest, and a camel coming to its aid; i'd feel the bear's fur warm and rough against me, the colors of the afternoon would fade, i'd reach into the bear's mouth and hold tight to its front tooth and think, "i'm not afraid")  there off sunset, in the lamplit starlight, a scientist is getting ready to destroy the world. "it's time for you to say good night," mama tells me; i go on in breathless joy. "remember, tomorrow is a school day," mama tells me; i go on in breathless joy.  at last i go to mama in her gray silk, to pop, to dandeen in her black silk. i put my arms around them, they put their arms around me. then i go back to my bedroom; i read as i undress. the scientist is ready to attack. mama calls, "is your light out?" i call back, "yes," and turn the light out. forced out of life into bed, for a moment i lie comfortless in the blank darkness; then as i always do, i put on the earphones of the crystal set— each bed has its earphones—and the uneasy tissue of their far-off star-sound, of the blue-violet of space, surrounds the sweet voice from the tabernacle of the four-square gospel. a vague marionette, tall, auburn, holds her arms out, to unshackle the bonds of sin, of sleep—as, next instant, the sun holds its arms out through the fig, the lemon tree, in the back yard the clucking hens all cackle as mama brings their chicken feed. i see my magazine. my magazine! dressing for school, i read how the good world wins its victory over that bad man. books; book strap; jump the footstool you made in manual training . . . then we three sit down, and one says grace; and then, by rule, by that habit that moves the stars, some coffee— one spoonful—is poured out into my milk and the milk, transubstantiated, is coffee. and mama's weekday wash-dress, dandeen's soft black silk are ways that habit itself makes holy just as, on sunday mornings, wednesday nights, his will comes in their ways—of church, of prayer meeting—to set free the spirit from the flesh it questions. so, so unquestioned, my own habit moves me to and through and from school, like a domino, till, home, i wake to find that i am playing dominoes with dandeen. her old face is slow in pleasure, slow in doubt, as she sits weighing strategies: patient, equable, and humble, she hears what this last child of hers is saying in pride or bewilderment; and she will grumble like a child or animal when, indifferent to the reasons of my better self, i mumble: "i'd better stop now—the rabbit . . ." i relent and play her one more game. it is miraculous to have a great-grandmother: i feel different from others as, between moves, we discuss the war between the states. the cheerful troops ride up to our farmhouse, steal from us the spoons, the horses—when their captain stoops to dandeen and puts dandeen on his horse, she cries . . . as i run by the chicken coops with lettuce for my rabbit, real remorse hurts me, here, now: the little girl is crying because i didn't write. because— of course, i was a child, i missed them so. but justifying hurts too: if only i could play you one more game, see you all one more time! i think of you dying forgiving me—or not, it is all the same to the forgiven . . . my rabbit's glad to see me; he scrambles to me, gives me little tame bites before he eats the lettuce. his furry long warm soft floppy ears, his crinkling nose are reassuring to a child. they guarantee, as so much here does, that the child knows who takes care of him, whom he takes care of.  mama comes out and takes in the clothes from the clothesline. she looks with righteous love at all of us, her spare face half a girl's. she enters a chicken coop, and the hens shove and flap and squawk, in fear; the whole flock whirls into the farthest corner. she chooses one, comes out, and wrings its neck. the body hurls itself out—lunging, reeling, it begins to run away from something, to fly away from something in great flopping circles. mama stands like a nun in the center of each awful, anguished ring. the thudding and scrambling go on, go on—then they fade, i open my eyes, it's over . . . could such a thing happen to anything ? it could to a rabbit, i'm afraid; it could to— "mama, you won't kill reddy ever, you won't ever, will you?" the farm woman tries to persuade the little boy, her grandson, that she'd never kill the boy's rabbit, never even think of it. he would like to believe her . . . and whenever i see her, there in that dark infinite, standing like judith, with the hen's head in her hand, i explain it away, in vain—a hypocrite, like all who love. into the blue wonderland of hollywood, the sun sinks, past the eucalyptus, the sphinx, the windmill, and i watch and read and hold my story tight. and when the bus stops at the corner and pop—pop!—steps down and i run out to meet him, a blurred nimbus, half-red, half-gold, enchants his sober brown face, his stooped shoulders, into the all-father's. he tells me about the work he's done downtown, we sit there on the steps. my universe mended almost, i tell him about the scientist. i say, "he couldn't really, could he, pop ?" my comforter's eyes light up, and he laughs. "no, that's just play, just make-believe," he says. the sky is gray, we sit there, at the end of our good day.  
NEW POEM
 all thoughts, all passions, all delights, whatever stirs this mortal frame, all are but ministers of love, and feed his sacred flame.  oft in my waking dreams do i live o'er again that happy hour, when midway on the mount i lay, beside the ruined tower.  the moonshine, stealing o'er the scene had blended with the lights of eve; and she was there, my hope, my joy, my own dear genevieve!  she leant against the arm{'e}d man, the statue of the arm{'e}d knight; she stood and listened to my lay, amid the lingering light.  few sorrows hath she of her own, my hope! my joy! my genevieve! she loves me best, whene'er i sing the songs that make her grieve.  i played a soft and doleful air, i sang an old and moving story— an old rude song, that suited well that ruin wild and hoary.  she listened with a flitting blush, with downcast eyes and modest grace; for well she knew, i could not choose but gaze upon her face.  i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand; and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land.  i told her how he pined: and ah! the deep, the low, the pleading tone with which i sang another's love, interpreted my own.  she listened with a flitting blush, with downcast eyes, and modest grace; and she forgave me, that i gazed too fondly on her face!  but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight, and that he crossed the mountain-woods, nor rested day nor night;  that sometimes from the savage den, and sometimes from the darksome shade, and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade,—  there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright; and that he knew it was a fiend, this miserable knight!  and that unknowing what he did, he leaped amid a murderous band, and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land!  and how she wept, and clasped his knees; and how she tended him in vain— and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain;—  and that she nursed him in a cave; and how his madness went away, when on the yellow forest-leaves a dying man he lay;—  his dying words—but when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty, my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity!  all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve; the music and the doleful tale, the rich and balmy eve;  and hopes, and fears that kindle hope, an undistinguishable throng, and gentle wishes long subdued, subdued and cherished long!  she wept with pity and delight, she blushed with love, and virgin-shame; and like the murmur of a dream, i heard her breathe my name.  her bosom heaved—she stepped aside, as conscious of my look she stepped— then suddenly, with timorous eye she fled to me and wept.  she half enclosed me with her arms, she pressed me with a meek embrace; and bending back her head, looked up, and gazed upon my face.  'twas partly love, and partly fear, and partly 'twas a bashful art, that i might rather feel, than see, the swelling of her heart.  i calmed her fears, and she was calm, and told her love with virgin pride; and so i won my genevieve, my bright and beauteous bride.  
NEW POEM
 the eyes open to a cry of pulleys, and spirited from sleep, the astounded soul hangs for a moment bodiless and simple as false dawn. outside the open window the morning air is all awash with angels.  some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses, some are in smocks: but truly there they are. now they are rising together in calm swells of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear with the deep joy of their impersonal breathing;  now they are flying in place, conveying the terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving and staying like white water; and now of a sudden they swoon down into so rapt a quiet that nobody seems to be there. the soul shrinks  from all that it is about to remember, from the punctual rape of every blessèd day, and cries, “oh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry, nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam and clear dances done in the sight of heaven.”  yet, as the sun acknowledges with a warm look the world’s hunks and colors, the soul descends once more in bitter love to accept the waking body, saying now in a changed voice as the man yawns and rises, “bring them down from their ruddy gallows; let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves; let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone, and the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating of dark habits, keeping their difficult balance.”  
NEW POEM
 i  room after room, i hunt the house through we inhabit together. heart, fear nothing, for, heart, thou shalt find her— next time, herself!—not the trouble behind her left in the curtain, the couch's perfume! as she brushed it, the cornice-wreath blossomed anew: yon looking-glass gleamed at the wave of her feather.  ii  yet the day wears, and door succeeds door; i try the fresh fortune— range the wide house from the wing to the centre. still the same chance! she goes out as i enter. spend my whole day in the quest,—who cares? but 'tis twilight, you see,—with such suites to explore, such closets to search, such alcoves to importune!

 some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than i, say, where his centric happiness doth lie; i have lov'd, and got, and told, but should i love, get, tell, till i were old, i should not find that hidden mystery. oh, 'tis imposture all! and as no chemic yet th'elixir got, but glorifies his pregnant pot if by the way to him befall some odoriferous thing, or medicinal, so, lovers dream a rich and long delight, but get a winter-seeming summer's night.  our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day, shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay? ends love in this, that my man can be as happy'as i can, if he can endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play? that loving wretch that swears 'tis not the bodies marry, but the minds, which he in her angelic finds, would swear as justly that he hears, in that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres. hope not for mind in women; at their best sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.  
NEW POEM
 tired of his dark dominion ... —george meredith it was something i’d overheard one evening at a party; a man i liked enormously saying to a mutual friend, a woman wearing a vest embroidered with scarlet and violet tulips that belled below each breast, “well, i’ve always preferred athens; greece seems to me a country of the day—rome, i’m afraid, strikes me as being a city of the night ... ” of course, i knew instantly just what he meant— not simply because i love standing on the terrace of my apartment on a clear evening as the constellations pulse low in the roman sky, the whole mind of night that i know so well shimmering in its elaborate webs of infinite, almost divine irony. no, and it wasn’t only that rome was my city of the night, that it was here i’d chosen to live when i grew tired of my ancient life as the underground man. and it wasn’t that rome’s darkness was of the kind that consoles so many vacancies of the soul; my rome, with its endless history of falls ... no, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark of the dreamer; this dark was like the violet fur spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of the she-wolf—all the sequins above in sequence, the white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians, a dark like the polished back of a mirror, the pool of the night scalloped and hanging above me, the inverted reflection of a last, odd narcissus ...  one night my friend nico came by close to three a.m. —as we drank a little wine, i could see the black of her pupils blown wide, the spread ripples of the opiate night ... and nico pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost touching my mouth, as she sighed, “look ... ,” and deep within the pupil of her left eye, almost like the mirage of a ship’s distant, hanging lantern rocking with the waves, i could see, at the most remote end of the receding, circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway, at the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil, a tiny, dangling crucifix— silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting in her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain ... some years later, i saw nico on stage in new york, singing inside loosed sheets of shattered light, a fluid kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked, emerging venus steps up along the scalloped lip of her shell, innocent and raw as fate, slowly obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly love of sexual sincerity ... i didn’t bother to say hello. i decided to remember the way in rome, out driving at night, she’d laugh as she let her head fall back against the cracked, red leather of my old lancia’s seats, the soft black wind fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents, ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves; the sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ... both of us racing silently as light. nowhere, then forever ... into the mind of the roman night.

 i went to the dances at chandlerville, and played snap-out at winchester. one time we changed partners, driving home in the moonlight of middle june, and then i found davis. we were married and lived together for seventy years, enjoying, working, raising the twelve children, eight of whom we lost ere i had reached the age of sixty. i spun, i wove, i kept the house, i nursed the sick, i made the garden, and for holiday rambled over the fields where sang the larks, and by spoon river gathering many a shell, and many a flower and medicinal weed — shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys. at ninety-six i had lived enough, that is all, and passed to a sweet repose. what is this i hear of sorrow and weariness, anger, discontent and drooping hopes? degenerate sons and daughters, life is too strong for you — it takes life to love life.

NEW POEM
 she always got mad at him every time he came home in the middle of the morning with his pant legs wet. she knew he had fallen in the ditch again. his legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches. he was too old to be walking over temporary dikes. she wished he didn’t do that, but sometimes he had to. she sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches, his head hitting hard cement, his body slowly sinking into the water. water that was only three feet deep. a harmless three feet of water, where children played, and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet, especially on hot summer evening. she knew he would drown, she knew it was bound to happen sometime.  as far as the eye could see, flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains. mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like. fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage place beneath the earth’s surface.  we are called “the people of the cotton fields” because of the labor our families did. for us there was no reservation, no housing &amp; urban development, no tribal support. we were a people segregated in row houses all lined up along the roads of our labor.  it is a muggy summer evening. my father, my sister, and i sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun. the change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally, to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.  on this evening the anticipation is shattered. a boy comes to the house. he gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing. with what the boy says to him my father moves quickly. as quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him. back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy. he rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat. he gets into his truck and drives away.  we pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing. a second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off. in a tone i recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her. she starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house. my sister and i walk beside her. saying nothing. her hands wring the towel she carries with her. this towel, a multipurpose kind of thing. women carry it to fan themselves, to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies. i remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university. whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.  we continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton. rows of cotton my family and i know well. in early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth, and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals. and in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks. now i can’t begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked, up and back, up and back along these rows.  we walk alongside her. the setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs, the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms. she heads toward the irrigation ditch. the ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery. the water is shallow. i see my father’s truck pulling up on the opposite side. in the front seat there are women, and in the back, men. the men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes. equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields. i remember the hoe he carried. it was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done. i recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship. “they call this a hoe?” i said to my husband. it had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of. the handle was too thin, causing blisters. once in awhile i look around for the type of hoe my father carried. i found one once, but didn’t have money to buy it.  in slow motion, weighed down by the heat, the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck. they slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging. in cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch. my mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string, is pulled toward them from the opposite side. their movement is dreamlike. they peer into the muddy water. and as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying, motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces. with a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail. this sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.

 the whit’ning ground in frost is bound; the snow is swiftly falling; while coldly blows the northern breeze, and whistles through the leafless trees, in hollow sounds appalling.  on this cold plain, now reach’d with pain, once stood my father’s dwelling: where smiling pleasure once was found, now desolation frowns around, and wintry blasts are yelling.  hope’s visions wild my thoughts beguil’d, my earliest days delighting, till unsuspected treach’ry came, beneath affection’s specious name, the lovely prospect blighting.  with many a wile of blackest guile did henry first deceive me: what winning words to him were giv’n! he swore, by all the pow’rs of heav’n, that he would never leave me.  with fondest truth i lov’d the youth: my soul, to guilt a stranger, knew not, in those too simple hours, that oft beneath the sweetest flow’rs is couch’d the deadliest danger.  with him to roam i fled my home; i burst the bonds of duty; i thought my days in joy would roll; but henry hid a demon’s soul beneath an angel’s beauty!  shall this poor heart e’er cease to smart? oh never! never! never! did av’rice whisper thee, or pride, false henry! for a wealthier bride to cast me off for ever?  my sire was poor: no golden store had he, no earthly treasure: i only could his griefs assuage, the only pillar of his age, his only source of pleasure.  with anguish wild, he miss’d his child, and long in vain he sought her: the fiercest thunder-bolts of heav’n shall on thy guilty head be driv’n, thou disobedient daughter!  i feel his fears, i see his tears, i hear his groans of sadness: my cruel falsehood seal’d his doom: he seems to curse me from the tomb, and fire my brain to madness!  oh! keenly blow, while drifts the snow, the cold nocturnal breezes; on me the gath’ring snow-flakes rest, and colder grows my friendless breast; my very heart-blood freezes!  ‘tis midnight deep, and thousands sleep, unknown to guilt and sorrow; they think not of a wretch like me, who cannot, dare not, hope to see the rising light to-morrow!  an outcast hurl’d from all the world, whom none would love or cherish, what now remains to end my woes, but here, amid the deep’ning snows, to lay me down and perish?  death’s icy dart invades my heart: just heav’n! all-good! all-seeing! thy matchless mercy i implore, when i must wake, to sleep no more, in realms of endless being!

 why should a foolish marriage vow, which long ago was made, oblige us to each other now when passion is decay'd? we lov'd, and we lov'd, as long as we could, till our love was lov'd out in us both: but our marriage is dead, when the pleasure is fled: 'twas pleasure first made it an oath.  if i have pleasures for a friend, and farther love in store, what wrong has he whose joys did end, and who could give no more? 'tis a madness that he should be jealous of me, or that i should bar him of another: for all we can gain is to give our selves pain, when neither can hinder the other.

 i have led her home, my love, my only friend, there is none like her, none. and never yet so warmly ran my blood and sweetly, on and on calming itself to the long-wished-for end, full to the banks, close on the promised good.  none like her, none. just now the dry-tongued laurels’ pattering talk seem’d her light foot along the garden walk, and shook my heart to think she comes once more; but even then i heard her close the door, the gates of heaven are closed, and she is gone.  there is none like her, none. nor will be when our summers have deceased. o, art thou sighing for lebanon in the long breeze that streams to thy delicious east, sighing for lebanon, dark cedar, tho’ thy limbs have here increased, upon a pastoral slope as fair,  and looking to the south, and fed with honeyed rain and delicate air, and haunted by the starry head of her whose gentle will has changed my fate, and made my life a perfumed altar-frame; and over whom thy darkness must have spread with such delight as theirs of old, thy great forefathers of the thornless garden, there shadowing the snow-limbed eve from whom she came.  here will i lie, while these long branches sway, and you fair stars that crown a happy day go in and out as if at merry play, who am no more so all forlorn, as when it seemed far better to be born to labour and the mattock-hardened hand than nursed at ease and brought to understand a sad astrology, the boundless plan that makes you tyrants in your iron skies, innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes, cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand his nothingness into man.  but now shine on, and what care i, who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl the countercharm of space and hollow sky, and do accept my madness, and would die to save from some slight shame one simple girl.  would die; for sullen-seeming death may give more life to love than is or ever was in our low world, where yet ’tis sweet to live. let no one ask me how it came to pass; it seems that i am happy, that to me a livelier emerald twinkles in the grass, a purer sapphire melts into the sea.  not die; but live a life of truest breath, and teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs. oh, why should love, like men in drinking-songs, spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?  make answer, maud my bliss, maud made my maud by that long loving kiss, life of my life, wilt thou not answer this? “the dusky strand of death inwoven here with dear love’s tie, makes love himself more dear.” is that enchanted moan only the swell of the long waves that roll in yonder bay? and hark the clock within, the silver knell of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white, and die to live, long as my pulses play; but now by this my love has closed her sight and given false death her hand, and stol’n away to dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell  among the fragments of the golden day. may nothing there her maiden grace affright! dear heart, i feel with thee the drowsy spell. my bride to be, my evermore delight, my own heart’s heart, my ownest own, farewell; it is but for a little space i go: and ye meanwhile far over moor and fell beat to the noiseless music of the night! has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow of your soft splendour that you look so bright? i have climbed nearer out of lonely hell. beat, happy stars, timing with things below, beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell. blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe that seems to draw—but it shall not be so: let all be well, be well.

 of these long scorching days but today my daughter is truly exasperating— stop it! i shout—or i’ll— and i twist her little pinked arm slowly, calibrating my ferocity—  you can’t hurt me you can’t hurt me! she’s so defiant, glowering, glaring at me— but frightened, her eyes bright with tears— see, i’m not even crying!  i see. but it’s the angel of extermination i see, shining in his black trappings, and turning ecstatically toward him, a little jewish girl tempts him to play his game of massacre.  —after vittorio sereni

 wife two was a stripper. and sweet, as well. he traded her in for me. to people i don't know, i say she was a dancer. i watch them, puzzled, wonder how anyone could not love a ballerina. and you have to question a guy like that: trading in a sweet stripper for me. not a homemaker. not home much at all. not sweet. more like my grandfather, jimmy grieco. mean. my mother likes to describe the blue-sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and i let it go. i was six. i begged for another. she said,okay, but, if you let this one go, i’m really going to be mad. i nodded, took the string in my hand, held tight, and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away.you were never sweet, my mother says. *** in vegas, a few weeks ago, jimmy and i sorted photographs in his double-wide just off boulder highway. my mother stood on the sidelines. she hates how i ask jimmy for the hard stories. tell me about the moonshine. tell me about the dead kids. tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm. jimmy’s crooked finger points to a picture of the family. that was leonard.he was deaf and dumb. died at twelve. that was vincent.the baby who fell off the staircase without a rail. dead at two. then there's his mother, surrounded by her children.she was tough, he says.tough. when chicago’s black hand demanded ten thousand dollars, she stuffed five grand in her apron, grabbed my grandfather—then five—and took him to deliver the money.that's all you'll ever get, she said,and don’t touch my kids or i’ll kill you. *** my grandfather never asks about the first or second wife. i don’t have to tell him that ballerina-fable. he knows i’m three and mean. he knows it for his whole life. his first, my grandmother, was like sugar. he burned her, abandoned her in la, raced to mexico, paved road turning to dirt; he ate prickly pear, maybe, on the way to his quick divorce. and, though he won’t tell this story, his own father lived, first, with a sweet woman on a wheat farm, far south in craco, italy. he boarded a ship, told his wife he’d send for her, and then fled to new york. and in an apartment on mulberry street, he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world. she wasn’t pretty.she was tough. she got busted twice for making moonshine. her sons loved her. she was mean.

 the column of the commander yielded to our first sweep. even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall of the general’s tomb without knowing it. so we began. his armies retook nubia, libya, and the levant, lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed sun king. overseer of all scribes, overseer of the priests of horus, grain-giver to all lands, royal chief of staff, regent, the general had himself carried on his palanquin through the wailing processions to oversee the work on this place. and so carved, thus: one of his men punches a nubian in the face. the general was low-born; everything had counted and he knew what counted most. his platoons lift open palms towards tutankhamun. the general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court for beseeching libyans. only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here, or the comeback challenge nuts! in the ardennes winter forest. he had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff to a higher, private terrace looking across to memphis. but then he rose to pharaoh. so he is not here. instead his first wife lay here, and then his queen also. at his own royal tomb in the valley, where the designs remained uncarved, sketching idea along stone, he does not rest either. the fine picklock hand got past anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him, the lord of upper and lower egypt. it got past truth with her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance. the general did deep obeisance to her. he is not here.  what at last moves the heart?  so much already moved, even in his own century, architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs. cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations. so coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudently remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off on their walk through the countryside. he followed them in his mind. that way no one would have to dismantle horeheb’s outer court to secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones. he cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones, sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples, hill lines, and the murder of lamb’s mother by his sister, a brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distance where such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther, then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, evening in the bath of waning fire, one bird stitching the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem— though he was not there, he could tell them that none the less he was next to his words and his word was with them, even unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back. one dome of air and fire. but he was not there. nor i here.  what removes the heart from what moves it?  as if i were the lecturer before a congress of doctors, his clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared out in silence, and at last said, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, the only thing i can see at this moment inside my brain, such as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.

 the day ended badly with a broken ankle, a jinxed printer, and a dead car. the dry yellow grass against the sunset saved me. roosters  pranced across a lawn of shit, proudly plumed in black feathers, bobbing before the gray goats. it was the first day i saw god in the quiet,  and found a mustard seed was very small. there i had been for years cursing “why?” and all the gold in the sun fell upon me.  there was a white mare in the midst of brown smog, majestic in the refinery clouds. even the radio wouldn’t work!  my mother limps and her hair falls out. the faithful drive white chevy trucks or yellow camrys, and i’m here golden  on the smoking shock-less bus. i lost language in this want, each poem dust, spanish fluttered  as music across the desert, even weeds tumbled unloved. the police sirens seared the coming night, dogs howled helplessly sad.  lo i walk the valley of death, love lingers in my hard eyes. mañana never comes just right. i mend myself in the folds  of paper songs, ring my paper bells for empty success.quiero nada, if i sing long enough, i’ll grow dreamlike and find a flock of pigeons, white under wings lifting awkward bodies like doves across the silky blue-white sky.

 at dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay: waves were broken scrolls.          beyond donegal, white mountains hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.  later, there was sleet: trees down on the drumholm road; near timoney’s farm, a frantic goose pinned under branches.  all night long, we spoke of loneliness, long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.  then the sky cleared and a marvel began: the hills turned blue; in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke. it gathered like a dream drenched in frost.  that should have been all.                           we had worn out night.  but single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the broken fence. they arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram: a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.  their image is with me still.               the backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as morning.

 mine own john poynz, since ye delight to know the cause why that homeward i me draw, and flee the press of courts, whereso they go, rather than to live thrall under the awe of lordly looks, wrappèd within my cloak, to will and lust learning to set a law: it is not for because i scorn or mock the power of them, to whom fortune hath lent charge over us, of right, to strike the stroke. but true it is that i have always meant less to esteem them than the common sort, of outward things that judge in their intent without regard what doth inward resort. i grant sometime that of glory the fire doth twyche my heart. me list not to report blame by honour, and honour to desire. but how may i this honour now attain, that cannot dye the colour black a liar? my poynz, i cannot from me tune to feign, to cloak the truth for praise without desert of them that list all vice for to retain. i cannot honour them that sets their part with venus and bacchus all their life long; nor hold my peace of them although i smart. i cannot crouch nor kneel to do so great a wrong, to worship them, like god on earth alone, that are as wolves these sely lambs among. i cannot with my word complain and moan, and suffer nought, nor smart without complaint, nor turn the word that from my mouth is gone. i cannot speak and look like a saint, use willes for wit, and make deceit a pleasure, and call craft counsel, for profit still to paint. i cannot wrest the law to fill the coffer with innocent blood to feed myself fat, and do most hurt where most help i offer. i am not he that can allow the state of him caesar, and damn cato to die, that with his death did scape out of the gate from caesar's hands (if livy do not lie) and would not live where liberty was lost; so did his heart the common weal apply. i am not he such eloquence to boast to make the crow singing as the swan; nor call the liond of cowardes beasts the most that cannot take a mouse as the cat can; and he that dieth for hunger of the gold call him alexander; and say that pan passeth apollo in music many fold; praise sir thopias for a noble tale, and scorn the story that the knight told; praise him for counsel that is drunk of ale; grin when he laugheth that beareth all the sway, frown when he frowneth and groan when is pale; on others' lust to hang both night and day: none of these points would ever frame in me. my wit is nought—i cannot learn the way. and much the less of things that greater be, that asken help of colours of device to join the mean with each extremity, with the nearest virtue to cloak alway the vice; and as to purpose, likewise it shall fall to press the virtue that it may not rise; as drunkenness good fellowship to call; the friendly foe with his double face say he is gentle and courteous therewithal; and say that favel hath a goodly grace in eloquence; and cruelty to name zeal of justice and change in time and place; and he that suffer'th offence without blame call him pitiful; and him true and plain that raileth reckless to every man's shame. say he is rude that cannot lie and feign; the lecher a lover; and tyranny to be the right of a prince's reign. i cannot, i; no, no, it will not be! this is the cause that i could never yet hang on their sleeves that way, as thou mayst see, a chip of chance more than a pound of wit. this maketh me at home to hunt and to hawk, and in foul weather at my book to sit; in frost and snow then with my bow to stalk; no man doth mark whereso i ride or go: in lusty leas at liberty i walk. and of these news i feel nor weal nor woe, save that a clog doth hang yet at my heel. no force for that, for it is ordered so, that i may leap both hedge and dyke full well. i am not now in france to judge the wine, with saffry sauce the delicates to feel; nor yet in spain, where one must him incline rather than to be, outwardly to seem: i meddle not with wits that be so fine. nor flanders' cheer letteth not my sight to deem of black and white; nor taketh my wit away with beastliness; they beasts do so esteem. nor i am not where christ is given in prey for money, poison, and treason at rome— a common practice used night and day: but here i am in kent and christendom among the muses where i read and rhyme; where if thou list, my poinz, for to come, thou shalt be judge how i do spend my time.

 for r.g. as if sliding down the green, scuffed face of the wave, a seaplane falls and turns together, keeping the waters of  the ear flat: a dead calm. but when the window’s frowning strip of shoreline, the battalions of tropical-drinks umbrellas  guarding the sandcastles and saltboxes of the rich, when these flip upside down, and the pale  clouded sky floats below the ocean, then we jolt awake— but this is not her dream, not water or land.  tell me again, what illness do i think i have?  the ropes of blood coil through her neck, they twist as it twists, as the head looks for parents and young men,  for nurses, strangers, year upon year attending until the pulpy blood knots up at last, and the warrens of  the brain dry and crackle, a town of names she saunters one long night: streets without signs lead to a girlhood park,  to songs under stars, and lipstick, old houses forever unbuilding themselves—but within the blue  jungle scaffolding, a gallery of faces stares back at her, portraits she can’t place . . . and then the town  flattens and crumbles behind her, it grows to dry scrabbled pasture under a dishplate moon, hanging there  in the tints of the sky, yet like a stopped clock, right twice a day:  now ma’am, can you remember the name of the president who was shot in the ‘60s?  —lincoln?  and if the names had sunk beneath the sea, rolling hump and hollow, leopard spotted foam—surgeons would haul up  the big sharks and club them silly, knife off a fin, then drop them bleeding onto the docks of alcatraz,  warning the inmates: “see that? no inside fin, they’ll  swim round this rock forever. . . .”  the convicts build the prison, then move inside, their block minds ignite a thousand homes by dawn,  then melt in the butter sun of breakfast porridge. . . . but this is not the philosopher’s circle prison,  no lidless eye radiates from the center, beneficent and watchful: the neutered grounds  here at the residence for life are groomed like the campus of depression state u:  past the dwarfish berms and drumlins a mazy cobalt walkway slithers to the storage lake,  with its hooded fount of aqua vitae sudsing the green larvae, its dry gazebo isle no one shuffles to . . .  one night, the distraught residence cook shoots himself dead: everyone mourns, but only the young staff  seek counseling, their threshold of death not yet raised to that of teetering mr. on-his-toes,  of ms. wheelchair-with-political-bumper-stickers, or elegant mrs. whisper, polite confused survivors of  wiped-out families, trolley cars, jobs learned and lost, a cosmos squeezed beneath the blood boulder—  why can’t i remember my problem?  they do not scream. they who once made things happen now watch things happen to them:  they hand their middle chapters to their children, and quietly appraise the spindle of  a leafless sapling outside, staked to three larger poles of wood: all of them under arrest.  and you must calm yourself. in the acrid hold of their boat, whose strangely knotted sail whips the wind  round on each side, anchorless boat that hugs the dock, and keeps the dock from drifting to sea,  you can hear the first, reeling chapters, of pierside painters crowding a rustic barrel-and-shanty scene  so clichéd the locals called it “port motif number one”—: the washy dab and smear of the medical test,  can you tell me what day this is?  —you mean now?  the brush like an oar rinses off its paints; a filmy rainbow upon the waters, coils and ribbons  you trace in your own sweet time.

 by this he knew she wept with waking eyes: that, at his hand's light quiver by her head, the strange low sobs that shook their common bed were called into her with a sharp surprise, and strangled mute, like little gaping snakes, dreadfully venomous to him. she lay stone-still, and the long darkness flowed away with muffled pulses. then, as midnight makes her giant heart of memory and tears drink the pale drug of silence, and so beat sleep's heavy measure, they from head to feet were moveless, looking through their dead black years, by vain regret scrawled over the blank wall. like sculptured effigies they might be seen upon their marriage-tomb, the sword between; each wishing for the sword that severs all.  
NEW POEM
 thus piteously love closed what he begat: the union of this ever-diverse pair! these two were rapid falcons in a snare, condemned to do the flitting of the bat. lovers beneath the singing sky of may, they wandered once; clear as the dew on flowers: but they fed not on the advancing hours: their hearts held cravings for the buried day. then each applied to each that fatal knife, deep questioning, which probes to endless dole. ah, what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life!— in tragic hints here see what evermore moves dark as yonder midnight ocean's force, thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse, to throw that faint thin line upon the shore!  
NEW POEM
 what may the woman labour to confess? there is about her mouth a nervous twitch. 'tis something to be told, or hidden:—which? i get a glimpse of hell in this mild guess. she has desires of touch, as if to feel that all the household things are things she knew. she stops before the glass. what sight in view? a face that seems the latest to reveal! for she turns from it hastily, and tossed irresolute, steals shadow-like to where i stand; and wavering pale before me there, her tears fall still as oak-leaves after frost. she will not speak. i will not ask. we are league-sundered by the silent gulf between. yon burly lovers on the village green, yours is a lower, and a happier star!  
NEW POEM
 last night, when the moon slipped into my attic room as an oblong of light, i sensed she’d come to commiserate.  it was august. she traveled with a small valise of darkness, and the first few stars returning to the northern sky,  and my room, it seemed, had missed her. she pretended an interest in the bookcase while other objects  stirred, as in a rock pool, with unexpected life: strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed, the paper-crowded desk;  the books, too, appeared inclined to open and confess. being sure the moon harbored some intention,  i waited; watched for an age her cool gaze shift first toward a flower sketch pinned on the far wall  then glide down to recline along the pinewood floor, before i’d had enough.moon, i said,we’re both scarred now.  are they quite beyond you, the simple words of love? say them. you are not my mother; with my mother, i waited unto death.  
NEW POEM
 for a long time the spanish from spain who came here became slightly insane in a special way and just a little. you can try this yourself. walk farther than you can into the forest in new york so it’s a toss-up whether or not you know the way back. for you there’s going to be a smidge of confusion, a glow of fear that smells like burning rye toast, and the illusion that you are the only person alive on the earth. you will probably have the second illusion that no one likes you, which doesn’t jibe with the first illusion of no other people. this was about the extent of it, for the spanish, they felt all that just a few hours a week, but every week at home, living in, say, small san francisco, which made thinking slow and hard at these times, but if you try this yourself in the deep woods you’ll see you can still think enough and you’ll remember your way back to the loving arms of your wife, husband, or mother, in rochester. (yes, you could try it as a child, but please don’t.) the spanish had a purpose to walk east inland to the sierras, the gold. the indians said there were five hills and two mountains entirely of gold and you had to wear ferns dangling before your eyes like sunglasses when you got near the mountains. the hills, they said, were not so bright. the spanish thought this was bullshit but were having trouble with the coast (where they truly believed the gold was) which was that boats could not travel north and south even as fast as people walking because the pacific coast was opposing currents (you made half a mile an hour in the water with biggest sail). an expedition of thirty spaniards from spain (living in small san francisco) walked east inland toward what’s now mariposa. it means butterfly. in that place, the shivering feathery insects rose from the ground and blacked out the sun. the sky had no room for more butterflies so the leftovers attached to the trees, making the trees appear like ragged trees. look up the other way, the explorers said to each other, but that way, when they did, was no blue sky but darkness of orange insects that did not fly in clouds but were the sky, so any forward motion by the thirty men seemed, not seemed did make the sky covered each inch with the thin trembling insects, brown or green or orange, but as a whole a black ceiling with little light between them and the men, who thought slow and hard but did think, and so returned to small san francisco where no one believed them but understood the illusion because when they asked the thirty men what such an encounter with butterflies felt like, the men described feeling the way all the colonists and explorers and priests and women felt a few hours each week at home— fear making the olfactory illusion of burning rye toast hand in hand with the illusion of being the only one and the simultaneous but contradictory illusion that no one likes you. how could everybody hate you if there was no everybody? or even anybody. well there was a way to fix this and we use it now around here (i mean in new york and california and nevada and hawaii, not just in my house) which is to wrap our loving arms around each other. it works very well and i know you’ve tried it. the spanish from spain brought virtuous women over for that purpose only (you don’t think the virtuous babes looked for gold, did you?) and it worked very well except the women were worse, i mean much worse, not just specially a little insane and needed the loving arms much more than the men. they needed longer sessions and more sessions. what’s more, if the expedition of thirty butterfly illusionists had gone six miles further, they would have seen silver sticking out of the ground like glass after a four-car accident on a street in rochester. but for many decades the promise of the waiting loving arms, versus the unacceptable illusion of the butterflies forming the entire black sky, kept them near the coasts. when you put down this book, you could decide for yourself if it is true that wrapping loving arms around somebody is as temporarily powerful as i’ve made it out to be or is possibly permanently powerful or is an illusion like the massed feathery insects which were absolute.

 when my grandmother died i thought, “she can’t die again.” everything in her life happened once and forever: her bed on our roof, the battle of good and evil in her tales, her black clothes, her mourning for her daughter who “was killed by headaches,” the rosary beads and her murmur, “forgive us our sins,” her empty vase from the ottoman time, her braid, each hair a history —  first were the sumerians, their dreams inscribed in clay tablets. they drew palms, so dates ripen before their sorrows. they drew an eye to chase evil away from their city. they drew circles and prayed for them: a drop of water a sun a moon a wheel spinning faster than earth. they begged: “oh gods, don’t die and leave us alone.”  over the tower of babel, light is exile, blurred, its codes crumbs of songs leftover for the birds.  more naked emperors passed by the tigris and more ships . . . the river full of crowns helmets books dead fish, and on the euphrates, corpse-lilies floating.  every minute a new hole in the body of the ship.  the clouds descended on us war by war, picked up our years, our hanging gardens, and flew away like storks.  we said there isn’t any worse to come.  then the barbarians came to the mother of two springs. they broke my grandmother’s grave: my clay tablet. they smashed the winged bulls whose eyes were sunflowers widely open watching the fragments of our first dreams for a lifetime.  my hand on the map as if on an old scar.  
NEW POEM
 1922: the stone porch of my grandfather’s summer house i  “i won’t go with you. i want to stay with grandpa!” that’s how i threw cold water on my mother and father’s watery martini pipe dreams at sunday dinner. ... fontainebleau, mattapoisett, puget sound.... nowhere was anywhere after a summer at my grandfather’s farm. diamond-pointed, athirst and norman, its alley of poplars paraded from grandmother’s rose garden to a scary stand of virgin pine, scrub, and paths forever pioneering.  one afternoon in 1922, i sat on the stone porch, looking through screens as black-grained as drifting coal. tockytock, tockytock clumped our alpine, edwardian cuckoo clock, slung with strangled, wooden game. our farmer was cementing a root-house under the hill. one of my hands was cool on a pile of black earth, the other warm on a pile of lime. all about me  were the works of my grandfather’s hands: snapshots of his liberty bell silver mine; his high school at stuttgart am neckar; stogie-brown beams; fools’-gold nuggets; octagonal red tiles, sweaty with a secret dank, crummy with ant-stale; a rocky mountain chaise longue, its legs, shellacked saplings. a pastel-pale huckleberry finn fished with a broom straw in a basin hollowed out of a millstone. like my grandfather, the d é cor was manly, comfortable, overbearing, disproportioned.  what were those sunflowers? pumpkins floating shoulder-high? it was sunset, sadie and nellie bearing pitchers of ice-tea, oranges, lemons, mint, and peppermints, and the jug of shandygaff, which grandpa made by blending half and half yeasty, wheezing homemade sarsaparilla with beer. the farm, entitled char-de-sa in the social register, was named for my grandfather’s children: charlotte, devereux, and sarah. no one had died there in my lifetime ... only cinder, our scottie puppy paralyzed from gobbling toads. i sat mixing black earth and lime.  ii  i was five and a half. my formal pearl gray shorts had been worn for three minutes. my perfection was the olympian poise of my models in the imperishable autumn display windows of rogers peet’s boys’ store below the state house in boston. distorting drops of water pinpricked my face in the basin’s mirror. i was a stuffed toucan with a bibulous, multicolored beak.  iii  up in the air by the lakeview window in the billiards-room, lurid in the doldrums of the sunset hour, my great aunt sarah was learning samson and delilah. she thundered on the keyboard of her dummy piano, with gauze curtains like a boudoir table, accordionlike yet soundless. it had been bought to spare the nerves of my grandmother, tone-deaf, quick as a cricket, now needing a fourth for “auction,” and casting a thirsty eye on aunt sarah, risen like the phoenix from her bed of troublesome snacks and tauchnitz classics.  forty years earlier, twenty, auburn headed, grasshopper notes of genius! family gossip says aunt sarah tilted her archaic athenian nose and jilted an astor. each morning she practiced on the grand piano at symphony hall, deathlike in the off-season summer— its naked greek statues draped with purple like the saints in holy week.... on the recital day, she failed to appear.  iv  i picked with a clean finger nail at the blue anchor on my sailor blouse washed white as a spinnaker. what in the world was i wishing? ... a sail-colored horse browsing in the bullrushes ... a fluff of the west wind puffing my blouse, kiting me over our seven chimneys, troubling the waters.... as small as sapphires were the ponds:quittacus, snippituit, and assawompset, halved by “the island,” where my uncle’s duck blind floated in a barrage of smoke-clouds. double-barreled shotguns stuck out like bundles of baby crow-bars. a single sculler in a camouflaged kayak was quacking to the decoys....  at the cabin between the waters, the nearest windows were already boarded. uncle devereux was closing camp for the winter. as if posed for “the engagement photograph,” he was wearing his severe war-uniform of a volunteer canadian officer. daylight from the doorway riddled his student posters, tacked helter-skelter on walls as raw as a boardwalk. mr. punch, a water melon in hockey tights, was tossing off a decanter of scotch. la belle france in a red, white and blue toga was accepting the arm of her “protector,” the ingenu and porcine edward vii. the pre-war music hall belles had goose necks, glorious signatures, beauty-moles, and coils of hair like rooster tails. the finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts being bushwhacked on the veldt— they were almost life-size....  my uncle was dying at twenty-nine. “you are behaving like children,” said my grandfather, when my uncle and aunt left their three baby daughters, and sailed for europe on a last honeymoon ... i cowered in terror. i wasn’t a child at all— unseen and all-seeing, i was agrippina in the golden house of nero.... near me was the white measuring-door my grandfather had penciled with my uncle’s heights. in 1911, he had stopped growing at just six feet. while i sat on the tiles, and dug at the anchor on my sailor blouse, uncle devereux stood behind me. he was as brushed as bayard, our riding horse. his face was putty. his blue coat and white trousers grew sharper and straighter. his coat was a blue jay’s tail, his trousers were solid cream from the top of the bottle. he was animated, hierarchical, like a ginger snap man in a clothes-press. he was dying of the incurable hodgkin’s disease.... my hands were warm, then cool, on the piles of earth and lime,  a black pile and a white pile.... come winter, uncle devereux would blend to the one color.

 my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room and offers supper in a bowl made of his breath.  the stew has boiled and i wonder at the cat born from its steam.  the cat is in the bedroom now, mewling. the cat is indecent and i, who am trying to be tidy, i, who am trying to do things the proper way, i, who am sick from the shedding, i am undone.  my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room and offers pastries in a basket spun from his vision.  it is closely woven, the kind of container some women collect.  i have seen these in many colors, but the basket he brings is simple: only black, only nude. the basket he brings is full of sweet scones and i eat even the crumbs. as if i've not dined for days.  my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room and offers tea made from the liquid he's crying.  i do not want my lover crying and i am sorry i ever asked for tea.  my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room pretending he never cried. he offers tea and cold cakes. the tea is delicious: spiced like the start of our courtship, honeyed and warm.  i drink every bit of the tea and put aside the rest.  my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room like a man loving his strength. the lock i replaced this morning will not keep him away.  my lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room and brings me nothing.  perhaps he has noticed how fat i've grown, indulged.  perhaps he is poor and sick of emptying his store.  it is no matter to me any longer, he has filled me, already, so full.  my lover who is far away opens the door to my room and tells me he is tired.  i do not ask what he's tired from for my lover, far away, has already disappeared.  the blankets are big with his body. the cat, under the covers, because it is cold out and she is not stupid, mews.

 i. the first question is always phrased this way: “so. how much indian are you?”  ii. we did not live in tepees. we did not braid our hair. we did not fringe our shirts. we did not wear war bonnets. we did not chase the buffalo. we did not carry shields. we were never plains indians. we tried to ride, but we kept falling off of our dogs.  iii. a local official came to our office to ask our help with a city event. he had a splendid idea, he said. to kick off the event and show everyone in town that our tribe was still around, we should go up to the bluff overlooking the city and make a big smoke signal. then they would know we were here. who ever heard of smoke signals in the forests? i imagined us upon the bluff, lighting one of those firestarter bricks. we haven’t made fire since the boy scouts took over. and how would the citizens know it was us? they’d probably call the fire department.  iv. as they ask, they think,yes, i can see it in her face. high cheekbones (whatever those are)and dark hair.  here’s a thought: don’t we all have high cheekbones? if we didn’t, our faces would cave in. (but i do have a colonized nose.)  i’m sick of explaining myself.  “you know,” i finally say, “it doesn’t matter to my people.” i ride off to my ranch-style home. time to weave a basket, or something.  
NEW POEM
 i.  the question is not how like the animals we are but how we got that way. we laugh, for what is a suicide note  but the epitaph of an emotion? few of us die out in the open; and when you say thesis, i say antithesis,  but we don’t stop there: we take our opposing ideas, plant them on opposing cliffs and then build a footbridge  between them, seemingly flimsy yet sturdy enough in fact to support a battalion. hidden behind trees, we watch  the soldiers march across it, single file, too scared to look down. we cheer them all, all except the boy  in the fairy tale who knew no fear. him we pity. he laughs open-eyed, ready to die as we were not.  he is one of us, all right, but better, stronger, stranger. he asks for more fear than anyone can bear.   ii.  the guilty had three choices: awkward chords of candor, canned laughter, or the wild hyacinth’s sutra, before  silence returned triumphant, and the journey resumed in darkness, though the sky above was classically blue.  everyone kept his opinion to himself as harmony dictated, and effigies of tristan and isolde  accompanied their stubborn footsteps across the wild terrain. yet the longing for a loud catharsis  at night renewed their pain. “if only we could climb out of these clouds and heartfelt headaches,  like ravished children in the glory of a snowball fight after school, and never again have to descend,  who would not abandon these erotic shipwrecks and fall asleep like tigers in the destined heights?”   iii.  at a festival of conceptual art in cairo, i saw a tank buried entirely in snow.  i knew then that silence is the source of all music, all laughter, all thought, and so  i stuffed pebbles in my mouth and stood by the sea and roared my defiance of the waves. it was here,  years before, that our plane and its shadow converged: i ran from the fire, carrying the flames  in my arms. i ran and ran, feeling like a man fighting a newspaper on a windy beach, but it wasn’t  a beach at all: the sand beneath me was snow, is snow, and the spears in the desert sky look like stars.  in the pyramid’s triangular shadow, i was the man who heard the crimson explosion, and ran. and ran.   iv.  keats in one of his letters says, “my imagination is a monastery and i am its monk.” i wonder.  if a man’s imagination is his monastery, this place looks a lot like an empty railway station,  king’s cross in london or the gare st. lazare in paris, a place whose smoke and fog monet dissolved  into a chorus of colors. there we stood, my love and i, having made our vows under the suspended clock,  hero and bride. but as we walked away, side by side, down the station’s sunless nave, amid the excitement  of the crowd, and foreign languages spoken loud, we knew our exile had already begun, could hear  the conductor’s shrill whistle, could see the light at the end of the tunnel, where the battlefields begin.   v.  paradise was hardly what psyche with her bleeding blackberries and nervous orgasms  could have foretold, enjoyed, and renounced for the sake of some querulous abstraction  designed to keep us unhappy but alive. call it civilization. call our disobedience instinctive.  or say we obeyed an angry muse, who ordered us to dance. “or else?” i asked. she sighed before answering.  “or else a dismal armchair will be your lot with chamber music your sole narcotic—music that will make  you face your former self, and grieve over incidents scarcely recalled, and eat without pleasure, and drink  without thirst, and dread what shall never come to pass.” in the revelation of our nakedness, we danced.   vi.  “a ball that is caught is fuller, by the weight of its return, than the same ball thrown.” our empty hands say so.  we feel free. in the other room the true believers remain, the ones who insist that evil is real, the only real thing.  cannibals and missionaries they are, accomplices in sin, greedy for punishment, to inflict or endure it.  we are glad to leave them behind, glad not to have to hear their chants and wails. down the elevator we go  and out into the canyon created by skyscraper shadows. yet even we, dedicated as we are to good living,  sometimes walk around with a lost look on our faces, as if the blessing for a piece of fruit or cup of wine  had suddenly come to mind, though cup and plate are empty; had come to mind and faded almost instantly away.   vii.  admit it: you used to walk around thinking there had to be a reason for things, for everything. that way  paranoia lies. not a science of syllables, the solitude total, but the prophet’s lit lantern was what you wanted—  and what you got was “neon in daylight,” a pleasure recommended by frank o’hara. those pleasures meant a lot to you,  you even thought you lived for them, until the first death (a nervous uncle broke the news when you landed at kennedy)  and the first marriage (you stayed up all night and read beyond the pleasure principle, a fair description  of your lovemaking). it seems that new myths are needed and consumed all the time by folks like you. each erases the last,  producing tomorrow’s tabula rasa, after a night of dreams in which the tigers of wrath become the tigers of repose.   viii.   go back to the beginning, to the first fist fight. they played for high stakes those days. the penalty for losing  was death or slavery, take your pick. to spare a life was the mark of the master; the mark of his slave  was fear. noble savage, nothing. forget about paradise. my vote goes to hobbes’s “life of man, solitary, poor,  nasty, brutish, and short.” an amazing sentence: the syllable that ends it also lends it its poignancy,  since we go on wanting what we can scarcely bear. go back, go back, back to when god became a swan  with beautiful wounded wings, and raped the astonished maiden. back to the dream that stays real when you wake up,  accustomed to your hunger and clinging to it, like a panther accustomed to his cage. go back.   ix.  a slap in the face, and the face burns with shame. anger comes later, comes stranger, looking for someone to blame.  end of message. can’t see the stars; can’t say anything that hasn’t been said before  by somebody slamming the door; can only repeat the syntax that brought the crowd to its feet  in the silence that appeased the nightingale. end of tale. but its moral was simple:  i lost the hearing in one of my ears and listened with the other to a deaf man’s  symphony. he built a heaven out of his fears that there wasn’t one. end of nightmare.  —the imperfect past, going by too fast, begged us to collect it. it couldn’t last.    x.  the doctor put his cards on the table. “take your pick,” he said. he was able  to offer me fear of extinction or fear of pain, though freedom from neither. “you mustn’t complain.”  in the vertiginous air, the monks wore masks to keep their germs to themselves and their  identities a secret. a hero to his own valet, the sultan choreographed his murderous ballet  until scheherazade, entering the circus tent with john the baptist’s head on a silver tray,  told her tale and made the crowd repent. the curtain dropped and the crowd went on its way,  but no one could say what the nightmare meant, or why it was sent to us, or by whom it was sent.   xi.  you can’t have it, so you want it, or you couldn’t have it, so you no longer want it, or  you’re stuck with it, forever. it was designed with you in mind, like the locked door that swung open majestically when you  spoke the magic words or just answered in the affirmative when your name was called. “here i am, ready to meet you,  ready to make any sacrifice,” you said, still in bed, wrestling with an evil angel  in your sleep. you were seventeen years old then and woke up with a limp. desire is like that:  the girl knows what you want and cries when she gives it to you because it was yours because  she whispered your name in your sleeping ear and said: “here i am.” and was gone a minute later.   xii.  i met her in one of those sleazebag bars— i think it was called the bottom line—in buffalo,  self-proclaimed “city of no illusions,” where silent men in shirtsleeves sit on bar stools and watch  girls with tattoos on their buttocks strip down to g-strings and panties. they dance to the thump  of moronic music, grind and hump under hot strobe lights, and then, when the act is over, circulate among the scumbags,  gyrating in front of each in turn, making each feel special, and each, aroused by the mingled smell of musk and sweat,  folds a dollar and sticks it into her crotch for a tip. she was different. when i left the bar that night i knew  she would follow, and she did, and i never looked back, never glanced at the rear-view mirror. all other women turned into her.   xiii.  her name was mary but was miriam before that and soon she will change it to alice. what she offered was a shadow  the shape of europe on the map above the bed of my youth. her shawl is all that remains of europe in the downstairs closet.  it was forbidden to lift up her skirt and look, look. yet boys and girls danced across the bridal morning like a bridge  as the wings of the fog like white sails lingered across the bay. i flew, like a caterpillar with wings, into a new day.  that was the day we buried europe. we built a dome in air and in the icy silence of the tomb. to hang like a spider  on a subway strap seemed a suitable fate for some, but we lit a candle and watched it cast the shadow of a mountain  in a valley. it was the awful shadow of some unseen power, a heaven in a wild flower. europe, bloody europe was gone.   xiv.  in the dream of your choice, you wake up in the garden of eden, alone except for a whore with a heart,  wearing a nurse’s uniform. the serpent says: listen carefully. this is for your own good.  at the tone it will be eight o’clock. nine out of ten physicians recommend  that you surround yourself with the kind of sorrows that can be instantly relieved by frivolous kisses,  with vegetables as lush as fruits ripening in your hands. when the hospital gates are opened,  don’t hesitate, run! and when you arrive at last in the land of the free, take your place in line with all of the others  as though nothing had happened between then and now to make you doubt the conviction that you’re blessed.   xv.  if you were a painter, you’d paint the wind green. it would shake the boughs of the honey locust trees.  it would chase the leaves across the continent. it would scatter their crumbs in a twist of swirling snow.  it would be colorless and green at the same time, the wind that aligns the pond and the cloud,  the wind that is everywhere, in constant motion, as buoyant as ariel and as scornful of gross caliban,  the wind that holds up the fly ball, drives it back into fair territory, causes it to drift within reach  of the right-fielder, who waves off the second baseman, until a last gust lifts the ball over both their heads  and it lands safely for the double that ends the game in extra innings, costing our team the pennant.   xvi.  after the flood, refreshed, was the first time you realized that the road to truth was the road  of flagrant fiction. you surrounded yourself with symbols (a mountain, a window, an ark,  a rainbow) and mythic creatures (the dove that returned and the raven that didn’t). you understood the dream  of the old woman who interpreted the sailor’s dream. then came the other birds, the clouds that come  when the rain is done, and the wind that signals the discovery of dry land, a new continent,  as the report of a gun sounds the start of the race, as the bottle broken beneath the bridegroom’s foot  begins the marriage, as church bells start the funeral parade and all the townspeople march in the procession.   xvii.  no longer is there freedom in confusion, nor forgiveness in confession,  nor charm in the old illusion of moonlight, the tower, the howling dog, the escaping lovers,  escaping into midnight in the western hemisphere, when the possibilities of expansion still seemed limitless  and the soul could choose among stars without number in the vast velvet night without end.  —in the midst of other woe than ours, i went to the window and cured the solitude of the listeners outside  who shivered in the rain, waiting for the police to come and ambulance sirens to sound. drunk i was when  i went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and said, “dad, dad, is that you?” in the terror of the night.   xviii.  “wherever you follow,” he said, “i will lead.” where summer met fall, she picked up a brittle orange leaf.  he wanted to lie on the grass, to lean and loaf at his ease, but the crisis intervened: news of her unpaid loan  prompted him to put his sandals on his head, as in the zen koan. slowly he walked away. silence followed, then the sound of a moan  in the room next door. so orange it seemed a painted moon shone against the indigo sky. and quickly her mood  went from unreasonable euphoria to realistic dejection, as the wood in the fireplace turned to ash without first yielding a flame. the wool  of their sweaters had begun to unravel. “if the fool persists in his folly,“ someone said, “he will have food  enough to eat, loaves and fishes galore. worship the good, which is beautiful though untrue. turn your back on gold.”   xix.  if we were painters we’d favor vibrant stripes, primary colors, flat surfaces, a lot of white  remaining on the canvas. if we were composers we’d take the music of exotic jungles with us  when we visit the vast vacant tundra. “if i were rich enough,” vowed the philanthropist, “i’d move  to a magnolia mansion and spend my days translating modern literature into ancient greek.”  great plans, distant vistas, a rearguard action to sabotage the present—and here we’ve all assembled,  at the antiseptic airport, with haunted looks on our faces. occasional eye contact between man with tan and woman in white.  “you look like your voice,” she says, breaking the silence. the rest of us know where we’re going, but we don’t know when.   xx.  they’ve cornered the market on moral outrage. yes, they have. the more noise they make about it, the more nervous we get.  they’re always telling us just how shallow we are. the only convictions we have, they say, are on our driver’s licenses.  the charge is not entirely fair to us, though it has its grain of truth. we tend to luxuriate in our indecisiveness. not they. no one can say  they lack conviction and passion and certitude. we have our doubts, which make us less glamorous and give us  the haunted look we wear. but something in defense of our bemused spectatorship must be said: at least it spares us  the postures of those hypocrite lechers, brothers and others who sublimate their sexuality into opulent rhetoric and chide us  for not doing the same. they have our best interests at heart. they may even be happier than we are. we have our doubts.   xxi.  today’s graffiti is in the sky: “more than meets the eye.” growing up i could tell the months by their smell.  first come the fruitstand smells of spring in the city, then the backyard trees get back their green, and we know  it’s the real thing. poetry is this puzzle of missing parts is best represented by clouds in the early evening sky,  because they constantly change shape, are utterly indifferent to us, and seem both remote and near at hand  at once. the creation of the world is a ballet with the dancers and music missing: what you see  is a miniature stage-set in a museum display case, and then suddenly you are walking in it, along the boulevard raspail,  until the eiffel tower comes into view. watch it organize the bridges of the seine into a coherent surprise.   xxii.  love accompanies the stranger to his streetlamp encircled by signing insects. the song he hears  meant doom or wax in the mariners’ ears. and now, as the smell of fresh cut grass gives way to the smell  of brown leaves burning, i want to tell you what i heard that night, and how the day  erased it: i woke to the rattle of a passing car which, accelerating up the rapidly rising ramp,  seemed delighted with its capacity for making noise. from far away i could hear it coming. and just as we know that fame isn’t all  it’s cracked up to be, that it can be downright nasty in fact, and yet we want it anyway,  so i, too, knew i belonged in one of those cars, tall behind the steering wheel, racing to meet the changing light.   xxiii.  winter came last. waves of snow from who knows which wind turned the meadow beside the frozen waterfall  into an ocean. the boy in the fairy tale who knew no fear soon learned. on the shore of the wide world he could hear  the violins of anger, spelling danger. poetry in this era of disbelief meant staring at a leaf until it turned into a star.  it was easier in the past. all you had to do was sleep outside and let nature take over. there were more stars in the sky  than we had room for in our philosophy. and when we woke, berries grew beside the burbling brook and bled in our soft hands.  the question was not how like the gods we were but whether we could recognize them in our sleep  and remember what we had seen, remember them clearly, when the radio alarm welcomes us into its next musical day.   xxiv.  i live in a boat in front of the door depicting the gods as they might have been forgotten  by lazarus during the tortures of interrogation. what i see are tombs and yellow stains on the snow.  instead of quotations, i will refer to my heart, instead of an altar, i will guard the munitions  and drink wine with the sour taste of cork and eat sour strawberries in the city of new york.  you who’ve been looking for a lost address, and mothers who seem to be fighting back their tears,  what made you think you could resist the roar of the years as they echo in a cavernous subway station?  can you see the boat in front of the door? what was it you forgot during the interrogation?   xxv.  ovid had it wrong. the plight of the frightened maiden gliding noiselessly into the woods, like a deer whose eyes  had been mesmerized by headlights on a cold november night, was implausible without the contrivance of arrows: love’s dart  claimed apollo while the dart of fear pierced daphne’s heart, and so she ran, deeper and deeper into the woods, losing ground  all the while to apollo (for love moved faster than fear), until the gods, granting her wish, turned the nymph  into a laurel, which apollo hopelessly embraced. poetic justice? yes, except it didn’t happen that way. their foot race ended  in a forest clearing, where daphne, exhausted but unashamed, made apollo watch her undress. he entered her  at her request, as if his will were an extension of her own. the trees, inclining their branches, nodded in consent. love won.   xxvi.  the boy, who was more eager than his father to live on a raft, sleep in the woods, and study the stars,  became his father, but not before he hid in a cave, slept in it overnight, and was saved by a spider from sure destruction.  the king’s soldiers, hot on his trail, saw the web stretch unbroken in the mouth of the cave, and assumed that no one was there.  what is the correct interpretation of the spider’s web? to the soldiers it meant desolation; to the spider, conquest;  to the grandfather telling the tale, providence. the boy sees the dew cling to the web at dawn. the natural camouflage  of rabbits and snakes isn’t lost on him. he notices the triangle formed by three birds in the bare-branched sycamore.  he can hear the hum of a bee admiring a tulip’s genitalia. and at night, he knows, all the colors are present in the white of the stars.   xxvii.  that was the year i first read h ö lderlin. the evening fell more slowly and the first day of spring  arrived more suddenly and stayed lovelier longer. boys pursued muses and girls impersonated them.  with the instinct of insects, he and she on the meadow mate. what they dreamed stays real when they wake up  in the evening of the first day of spring. did they fall out of paradise or were they pushed?  it’s unclear, but we next see them enter the gathering dusk, hand in hand, and the camera pulls back and the voiceover says,  “good fortune is even harder to bear than the bad fortune that came first. remember this  about the gods: their own immortality suffices them. the source of all rivers is a riddle even i cannot solve.”   xxviii.  how little i have changed since then, or how much of the change is in the eyes of the beholder  of a book i lived rather than wrote, whose author seems like a stranger to me today. i remember,  for example, wanting to write an apocalyptic parody of milton, in milton’s high style, titled “eden in flames.”  adam and eve celebrated their carnality, and when they woke, the branches of the fruit trees curved gracefully down  and served them nectar. i couldn’t bring myself to describe their banishment, and so the project failed. yet what i heard  when i slept sounded a lot like the chorus of joy in beethoven’s ninth, and what i saw when i woke up,  if only for the length of a dream, was a deer, eyes mesmerized by headlights, motionless in the middle of the road.   xxix.  you could be the only passenger on the bus who notices that the driver is blind. i, by contrast,  have eyes only for lovely you. give me your hand. i will kiss it. you are cordially invited to my studio,  which resembles a psychiatrist’s office. once there, i put on my glasses, read passages out loud from plato, hobbes, marx, and freud,  and ask you for your opinion of each. together we analyze solitude. there is a meeting of the minds,  and sex follows. it’s the first day of spring and we want to walk along the river and roll on the grass and take off  our clothes while leaving the windows wide open. in fact, we can’t wait to get off this bus, which seems to be going  nowhere fast, as spring puts her tongue in my ear and names the forbidden parts of her body.   xxx.  no one could say what the nightmare meant in the operating theater or the circus tent.  and none of this will help us pay the rent: many are called and sleep through the ringing,  but we know it’s spring, though we’ve thrown our watches away. our dreams, stretching across the chasm of day.  don’t deter us from waking, jumping into our clothes, dancing down the avenue, and swinging through  the revolving doors of the future, where we used to live, the day before yesterday, when we weren’t dying.  —the question is whether the raven will return after his end-of-the-world adventures, after the storm  when one by one the masks slip off, and the bride embraces the guilty son: true to the test, remembered and confessed.   
NEW POEM
 i gave you sorrow to hang on your wall like a calendar in one color. i wear a torn place on my sleeve. it isn’t as simple as that.  between no place of mine and no place of yours you’d have thought i’d know the way by now just from thinking it over. oh i know i’ve no excuse to be stuck here turning like a mirror on a string, except it’s hardly credible how it all keeps changing. loss has a wider choice of directions than the other thing.  as if i had a system i shuffle among the lies turning them over, if only i could be sure what i’d lost. i uncover my footprints, i poke them till the eyes open. they don’t recall what it looked like. when was i using it last? was it like a ring or a light or the autumn pond which chokes and glitters but grows colder? it could be all in the mind.  anyway nothing seems to bring it back to me.  and i’ve been to see your hands as trees borne away on a flood, the same film over and over, and an old one at that, shattering its account to the last of the digits, and nothing and the blank end.  the lightning has shown me the scars of the future.  i’ve had a long look at someone alone like a key in a lock without what it takes to turn.  it isn’t as simple as that.  winter will think back to your lit harvest for which there is no help, and the seed of eloquence will open its wings when you are gone. but at this moment when the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye and my only chance is bleeding from me, when my one chance is bleeding, for speaking either truth or comfort i have no more tongue than a wound.

 she’s got a hundred &amp; two temperature, delivery room nurses said. you’re gonna live, though — long enough to know you’re going to go as quickly as you came, gonna make your mother swear by you, going to shake your bible with red-tipped nails before you vanish into chicago south side skies that bleed — not like watercolor, not like a wound, not like a fat, bitten plum — not necessarily. no, not necessarily. nothing that precious or predictable.speak nicely to others &amp; they will nicely speak to you, your mother said. no, not so, you said fairly close to the end. no time to wait for mother’s ride home or for saviors, coming soon.

 never give all the heart, for love will hardly seem worth thinking of to passionate women if it seem certain, and they never dream that it fades out from kiss to kiss; for everything that’s lovely is but a brief, dreamy, kind delight. o never give the heart outright, for they, for all smooth lips can say, have given their hearts up to the play. and who could play it well enough if deaf and dumb and blind with love? he that made this knows all the cost, for he gave all his heart and lost.

 to michael lally you had your own reasons for getting in your own way. you didn’t want to be clear to yourself. you knew a hell of a lot more than you were willing to let yourself know. i felt natural love for you on the spot. r-e-s-p-e-c-t. right. beautiful. i don’t use the word lightly. i protested with whatever love (honesty) (&amp; frontal nudity) a yes basically reserved irish catholic american providence rhode island new englander is able to manage. you are sophisticated, not uncomplicated, not naïve, and not simple. an entertainer, &amp; i am, too. frank o’hara respected love, so do you, &amp; so do we. he was himself &amp; i was me. and when we came together each ourselves in iowa, all the way that was love, &amp; it still is, love, today. can you see me in what i say? because as well i see you know in what you have to say, i did love frank, as i do you, “in the right way”. that’s just talk, not logos, a getting down to cases: i take it as simple particulars that we wear our feelings on our faces.  
NEW POEM
 i bring the cat’s body home from the vet’s in a running-shoe box held shut with elastic bands. then i clean the corners where she has eaten and slept, scrubbing the hard bits of food from the baseboard, dumping the litter and blasting the pan with a hose. the plastic dishes i hide in the basement, the pee- soaked towel i put in the trash. i put the catnip mouse in the box and i put the box away, too, in a deep dirt drawer in the earth.  when the death-energy leaves me, i go to the room where my daughter slept in nursery school, grammar school, high school, i lie on her milky bedspread and think of the day i left her at college, how nothing could keep me from gouging the melted candle-wax out from between her floorboards, or taking a razor blade to the decal that said to the firemen, “break this window first.” i close my eyes now and enter a place that’s clearly expecting me, swaddled in loss and then losing that, too, as i move from room to bone-white room in the house of the rest of my life.  
NEW POEM
 the word penis is probably the most misattributed word in english, i think. because almost nobody has a real one. the standards are made in japanese or german factories.  womb/vagina sets are unusual too if genuine. standards are from china; they are recycled sheepskin wallets. i was shocked too when i heard this.  i do not have an actual either but they called me a genius when i figured it out about the fetal lamb/sheep skin. what else to do with all the wallets  now that there’s no money? only barter. i do not know what the inside of this thing looks like but i think it looks like a brain made of mozzarella cheese.  standard penises are made of a certain kind of plant. an ocean weed and how it’s fitted is by body weight at birth which is why you shouldn’t smoke  if you are pregnant, you will be blamed even though it’s complicated to know exact reasons as we all in the new world know better each day.  they’ve made new lingo to go with the genuine penis. they say unicorn, i say wasabi. apparently, almost everyone gets green horseradish with sushi.  wasabi takes several million years to grow, its taste is delicate. when i mentioned japan earlier, i meant the motor city.  when i say wasabi near japan; it’s island of slow unit dance or remarkable mask. when i say new world, it’s where the newly suited go.  t-cell robots, we of lambs and plants and jellyfish that are in our eyes which are colored by their place in the ocean. really, if you broke us down, you’d have quite a collection:  resins from pine, precious stones, silver dust, and sea grass filaments, stalks, pig livers, skin, a milk protein.  this is the equipment for the dominant standard penis holders of the unreal, and i would love to be one with a genuine but i have not the stomach to pull off the cunning necessary  for the genuine purse/penis license. you barter for it; you lie. don’t get me wrong, it must be nice  to have options. but to get them dishonestly? it’s bothering. i know, i know! i have got to say goodbye to the babyhood phase.  learn to thrive! nobody has a father or a mother. i know this means to thrive! to be one’s own lover.  my sheepskin wallet is . . . what could a person say? stuck in the past, tripped up by the concept of wallet?  it’s not like anything gets taken out unless it’s rotten which it probably isn’t because i feel okay and you look alright.  it’s that it wants to be ultimate although a new and genuine vagina/womb set from a biped has not been recorded in over 180 years  which means billions of here/now moments. which means forgotten a trillion times and remembered exactly one plus that.  there’s not as much empty space as we thought in the old blueprints that made donuts in space—the halo, the homeric lure.  the one electron penis and the drone. i’ve been sick and found all this out because i couldn’t get out of bed and there was a diamond near my head.  i was reading about moray eels, their hydraulics. how they practically fly-fish with agility.  it’s the forward going. i’d like to go boldly. i’ve kept a card of energy.  wilderness saved from childhood. of this secret, one must be silent so the sun can trust us.  kids need each other. better they never get separated entirely.  contra this, i do want to fly fish. to cast off and plant it then go with the nylon line. where to take off  the old wallet and give it back to a lamb. i’ll be the promo homo making arrangements to go to the show  where we trade our new pieces congenially and find others, depleted by scavengers, and get them up-and-running to better suns,  not the promised land, exactly the opposite. exactly the opposite of anything promised.

 les morts c’est sous terre; ça n’en sort guère. laforgue our diaries squatted, toad-like, on dark closet ledges. forget-me-not and thistle decalcomaned the pages. but where, where are they now, all the sad squalors of those between-wars parlors?— cut flowers; and the sunlight spilt like soda on torporous rugs; the photo albums all outspread ... the dead don’t get around much anymore.

 because a little reprieve, a little hope (even for those whom i love) would exculpate the world of  its actions, i hold to logic steadfast. belief, without knowledge, dislodges perception of all the empirical world — (even for you, mom and dad). know that if, for you, on some filthy lie i could wish for the mind’s persistence after death, i would say no.

NEW POEM
 after alfred stieglitz not so much the missing of things but the nostalgia of colors, their music,  the ordinary revelation of a family’s life caught in the flop and dance, a jig,  if you will, of their layers, outer and inner skins, the secret things so close to the body,  the taste, the salt and sweet of blood, and shit, and piss, and then, rinsed and scrubbed, leaving  beneath the astringent scent of soap a musky marker of self for strays  to smell or imagine as they walk past the parade of the living  on taut lines, propped by poles with nails for a hook, above  the startling green of grass and hedge, the barefaced concrete steps,  the sky, inscrutable as a wall; this is what one carries as a kind  of sweetness — the labor of brown hands, elbow-deep in suds, the rituals  of cleansing, the humility of a darning or a frayed crotch, the dignity  of cleanliness, the democracy of truth, the way we lived our lives in the open.  
NEW POEM
 1. of the gardens of adonis, lydia, i love most of all those fugitive roses that on the day they are born, that very day, must also die. eternal, for them, the light of day: they're born when the sun is already high and die before apollo's course  across the visible sky is run. we too, of our lives, must make one day: we never know, my lydia, nor want to know of nights before or after the little while that we may last. 2. to be great, be whole: nothing that's you should you exaggerate or exclude. in each thing, be all. give all you are in the least you ever do. the whole moon, because it rides so high, is reflected in each pool.  
NEW POEM
 xii  once again i look out your window and the world looks oddly different, maybe the fields have blossomed, or perhaps more stars have been born  delirious waves caress my feet, something new, unknown, sunsets whisper in my ear as well, everywhere i find your odor, your shape  you are among old-growth pines, in the fog along the coastal rocks, around the most somber of afternoons  impossible to wipe away your job from my eyes, from my sad mouth— you are the universe made flesh  
NEW POEM
 oh antic god return to me my mother in her thirties leaned across the front porch the huge pillow of her breasts pressing against the rail summoning me in for bed.  i am almost the dead woman’s age times two.  i can barely recall her song the scent of her hands though her wild hair scratches my dreams at night.   return to me, oh lord of then and now, my mother’s calling, her young voice humming my name.  
NEW POEM
 i have had playmates, i have had companions, in my days of childhood, in my joyful school-days, all, all are gone, the old familiar faces.  i have been laughing, i have been carousing, drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies, all, all are gone, the old familiar faces.  i loved a love once, fairest among women; closed are her doors on me, i must not see her — all, all are gone, the old familiar faces.  i have a friend, a kinder friend has no man; like an ingrate, i left my friend abruptly; left him, to muse on the old familiar faces.  ghost-like, i paced round the haunts of my childhood. earth seemed a desert i was bound to traverse, seeking to find the old familiar faces.  friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother, why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling? so might we talk of the old familiar faces —  how some they have died, and some they have left me, and some are taken from me; all are departed; all, all are gone, the old familiar faces.  
NEW POEM
 that which her slender waist confin’d, shall now my joyful temples bind; no monarch but would give his crown, his arms might do what this has done.  it was my heaven’s extremest sphere, the pale which held that lovely deer, my joy, my grief, my hope, my love, did all within this circle move.  a narrow compass, and yet there dwelt all that’s good, and all that’s fair; give me but what this ribbon bound, take all the rest the sun goes round.  
NEW POEM
 the sheep-killing dogs saunter home, wool scraps in their teeth.  from the den of the moon ancestral wolves howl their approval.  the farm boys, asleep in their beds, live the same wildness under their lids; every morning they come back through the whites of their eyes to do their chores, their hands pausing to pet the dog, to press its ears back, over the skull, to quiet that other world.  
NEW POEM
 for grandfather, in bangkok i can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards away from your casket, away from their expert invasions, kneeling by the order of our births alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics, the family at your death keeps to form, having to act out that love of endings.  i can say the little i know of how you lived is your patient gaze in old photographs, surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling offspring back from the states or australia or wherever they’d been taken, children barely known but abided on holidays. today i’m told we have to place  pennies in the dead man’s mouth to remind us of the portions left behind. you pay the debt, someone says,you give your something solid back, push your currency up against the open,  up against the father tongue. it’s the formal silence we love, the hush that’s planned, the good answer, monks, boyish and newly shorn, who know to whip your burial cloth exactly three times over the altar flame to purify countless threads.  who know when to kneel, when to back away from the casket. the casket itself carved patiently, inlaid with the images, portions left behind of silver shrunken disciples, each framed to each then framed again by  squares of alabaster scrollwork whittled into black wood: the whole teak surface worried, grandfather, with carpenter’s gold, splintered, then resplintered, puzzled with lapis.  the eastern window’s been slivered open, to make the sun stab the craftmen’s metallic fretwork. the mourners too, suddenly embossed, become dozens shifting to kneel. when a few clouds  eclipse the sun, wiping away the borders, the frame and scrimshaw, so that we stand briefly in the room’s darkened largeness, next to me someone whispers,  how your vessel is rented, a work to be given back.  
NEW POEM
 october 18, 1914 i dreamt that people from the land of chimes arrived one autumn morning with their bells, to hoist them on the towers and citadels of my own country, that the musical rhymes  rung by them into space at meted times amid the market's daily stir and stress, and the night's empty star-lit silentness, might solace souls of this and kindred climes.  then i awoke; and lo, before me stood the visioned ones, but pale and full of fear; from bruges they came, and antwerp, and ostend,  no carillons in their train. foes of mad mood had shattered these to shards amid the gear of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end.  
NEW POEM
 there was dai puw. he was no good. they put him in the fields to dock swedes, and took the knife from him, when he came home at late evening with a grin like the slash of a knife on his face.  there was llew puw, and he was no good. every evening after the ploughing with the big tractor he would sit in his chair, and stare into the tangled fire garden, opening his slow lips like a snail.  there was huw puw, too. what shall i say? i have heard him whistling in the hedges on and on, as though winter would never again leave those fields, and all the trees were deformed.  and lastly there was the girl; beauty under some spell of the beast. her pale face was the lantern by which they read in life’s dark book the shrill sentence: god is love.  
NEW POEM
 i lay down under language it left me and i slept  —you, the comforter, came into the room  my blood, my mouth all buttoned away—  makers of houses, books, clothes- makers, goodbye—  
NEW POEM
 the count of cappuccino, the marquise of meringue, all the little cantuccini... and what was the song they sang?  oh, the best of us is nothing but a sweetening of the air, a tryst between the teeth and tongue: we meet and no one’s there  though the café’s always crowded as society arrives and light glints to and fro between the eyes and rings and knives.  we’ll slip away together, perfect ghosts of appetite, the balancing of ash on fire and whim—the mating flight  of amaretti papers, my petite montgolfiere , our lit cage rising weightless up the lift shaft of the air.  so the count of cappuccino, the marquise of not much more, consumed each other’s hunger. then the crash. and then the war.  
NEW POEM
 the roman catholic bells of princeton, new jersey, wake me from rousing dreams into a resounding hangover. sweet jesus, my life is hateful to me. seven a.m. and time to walk my dog on a leash.  ice on the sidewalk and in the gutters, and the wind comes down our one-way street like a deuce-and-a-half, a six-by, a semi, huge with a cold load of growls.  there's not only leaf left to bear witness, with twitch and scuttle, rattle and rasp, against the blatant roaring of the wrongway wind. only my nose running and my face frozen  into a kind of grin which has nothing to do with the ice and the wind or death and december, but joy pure and simple when my black and tan puppy, for the first time ever, lifts his hind leg to pee.  
NEW POEM
 which are the magic moments in ordinary time? all of them, for those who can see. that is what redemption means, i decide at the meeting. then walk with david wearing his new yale t-shirt and new long hair to 103. leonard and eileen come, too. leonard wears a shark’s tooth on a chain around his neck and long blond hair. these days he’s the manager of boots and saddles (“bras and girdles,” my beloved bobby used to say) and costumer for the gay cable network’s dating game. one week the announcer is a rhinestone cowboy, sequin shirt and black fur chaps, the next a leatherman, etc. eileen’s crewcut makes her face light up. underneath our hairstyles, 23 years of sobriety, all told— the age of a girl who’s “not so young but not so very old,” wrote berryman, who flew from his recovery with the force of a poet hitting bottom. it’s not the way i choose to go out of this restaurant or day today, and i have a choice. wanda the comedian comes over to our table. “call me wicked wanda,” she smirks when we’re introduced. why is new york city awash in stand-up comics at the least funny point in its history? still, some things stay the same. people wonder what the people in their buildings would think if the ones who were wondering became incredibly famous, as famous as madonna. debby harry lived in eileen’s building in the village in the early seventies, and she was just the shy girl in the band upstairs. poets read the writing of their friends, and are happy when they like it thoroughly, when the work’s that good and the crippling sense of competition stays away. trips get planned: david home to california, eileen to new mexico, chris and i to france and spain, on vectors which will spread out from a single point, like ribs of an umbrella. then after the comfort of a wedge of blueberry peach pie and cup of decaf, sober friends thread separate ways home through the maze of blankets on the sidewalk covered with the scraps of someone else’s life. mine consists of understanding that the magic isn’t something that i make, but something that shines through the things i make and do and say the way a brooch or scrap of fabric shines from the detritus to catch leonard’s eye and be of use for costumes, when i am fearless and thorough enough to give it room, all the room there is in ordinary time, which embraces all the people and events and hopes that choke the street tonight and still leaves room for everyone and everything and every other place, the undescribed and indescribable, more various and cacophonous than voice can tell or mind conceive, and for the sky’s vast depths from which they’re all a speck of light.  
NEW POEM
 i try to make myself afraid, the way you must have been afraid, stepping out onto this stage— but with a fear so pure, so  perfectly informed that you strode out shouting. here, where the neon yellow arrows painted on the floor shoot forward underfoot  in blackness—beneath the hanging sequence of tinted skies—out toward that mindless immortalizing light, now dark. now i think i feel the heat you  must have felt rising from the front rows. a gaping fire door, a furnace: your single body standing here with no shadow, swinging on itself.  had you been a fool, you might have thought that they loved you. they never love you, you said. they are hungry for the god in his gold eclipse, the pure you on fire.  john and i move quickly, each with a handful of ash, scattering. the sound of no sound falling into the cracks in the boards, the footlights, the first row. a small personal snow: a prince  of dust, a villain of dust. each part you played drifting up again, recomposing. i open my hand, i let you go—back into the lines you learned, back into the body and the body's beauty—  back into the standing ovation: bow after bow after bow.  
NEW POEM
 waiting for your ride in front of the house where you spent the night, where, as a third ear during their endless intimate, important, and kinky phone calls, you pretended to rinse glassware; you were a dog from the pound, grateful, sniffing the upholstery.  later, lying in the center of their king-sized bed, a giant wall-to-wall mirror, isolating you like a rabbit; it was also their exercise room with torture equipment; something in you twitched; flickering a bizarre video in your head.  it’s morning now. you’re standing outside, with nightgown and toothbrush wrapped in your purse, waiting for a bus to take you somewhere else. you’re depressed. they’re asleep of course. their network wrapped around them. you keep wondering why you’re missing something. then you look back and see your pricked-up ears, your waggy self, stuck inside their picture window, where for years it will wave at you—naive, apologetic, embarrassed.  
NEW POEM
 there were no road rails. i remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffs we motored along. i remember speed in a parched chevy clunker that could not have sped, and bench seats, and no buckles, and bare thighs peeling off faux leather at every hairpin. every elevated canyon mile was a feat but a breath of less slickened air too, less cog and fume — a winding away from the wavering, sea-leg steam off blinding sidewalks, infinite sidewalks and other shoeless kids kicking rusted palm leaves outside infinite apartment complexes. away from our corner of the valley of concrete corners, of no evidence of valley besides boulders stacked in the distance of every vista.  the driver was a stranger, was my mother after my whole life had passed with stranger after stranger, was my mother after seven years, and me at seven years with her driving that snuff-colored nova from her blinding valley not a valley — through laurel, topanga, malibu canyons all the way to some fantastic, to her beloved blue — eucalyptus choking local growth the whole trek. and the cooling air as we  efforted west, and the jolt of a castle,the castle, in a distant crook of a range that hid the slate of the ocean,  made me want to stop moving but not stop here. i remember hoping to find hermit crabs the size of the mole on my right side chin. and if i tethered them to a stick they’d line up by mass and trade shells, find homes that fit. and there’d be one left without, one torn out. a book said a scientist leaned into wet sand, watched a torn crab die in the beak of a gull. i can’t remember if i saw that death or read it.  i remember  watching a wrong castle tucked into a wrong mountain notch on the chin of the sky, like the hermit mole on my chin if my face were the sky. “it’s a beauty mark,” my mother had said, “don’t pick at it.” i eyed that smoking stranger at the wheel and dug my nail in as the pacific swelled into view that first time.  
NEW POEM
 because a lie is not a lie if the teller believes it, the way beautiful things  reassure us of the world’s wholeness, of our wholeness, is not quite a lie.  beautiful things believe their own narrative, the narrative that makes them  beautiful. i almost believed it until the new mother strapped  her infant to her chest, opened the eighth-floor window,  and jumped. my daughter tells me, after her preschool field trip  to the firefighter museum, about the elephant mask, its hose  like a trunk, and the video of a man on fire being smothered in blankets.  she asks me if she knows anyone who got dead in a fire, anyone who  got fired. when will i die? she asks. when i was a child, i churched  my hands, i steepled my hands, and all the people were inside,  each finger a man, a woman, a child.when i die, will you  still love me? she asks. the mother cracked on the pavement—  how did the baby live? look, he smiles and totters around  the apartment eight stories up. beautiful things reassure us  of the world’s wholeness: each child sliding down the pole  into the fire captain’s arms. but what’s whole doesn’t sell  itself as such: buy this whole apple, this whole car. live this whole life.  a lie is not a lie if the teller believes it? next time the man  in the video will not ignite. the baby will open like a parachute.  
NEW POEM
 sweet marie-anne, she thought being french, intellectual and brunette  entitled her, in any parisian cafe to prompt service—and she was  probably right, (as the policeman later confirmed)—always provided  the situation was normal, and she herself did not let the race down.  so that afternoon, she said to me: “sit by me,mon cheri, and order  a drink!”—well! the waiter came as was his duty, only to stand aghast  at the unspeakable scandal of a full-blooded french woman kissing  this merde of a black man openly and full on the lips!—purebred son of  the galls, his first impulse was to smash his tray at the black head  and shriek out for help to the army of riot police permanently stationed on the streets  of the latin quarter . . . —but he was a non-violent man, and besides,  he had the customer’s tip to think of. so he turned to me, swallowing hard, and  with controlled french politeness, he said: “m’sieur, please sit opposite the lady—  “yes, with the sacre table between you, face to face—or mon cul, dammit, i shall not serve you!”—and i was still wiping off her lipstick, wondering what to do, when my lady  spoke, her face red with indignation: “but you’re mistaken! this one’s not like the rest,  “can’t you see! he’s a bon sauvage, and has written such brilliant essays in impreccable french  “on the phallus of—pardon, the merits of negritude! show him my dear!” she turned to me, “show how well  “you quote molière, corneille, and—” but the waiter was already smiling and bowing: i had passed my test.  
NEW POEM
 we have gone out in boats upon the sea at night, lost, and the vast waters close traps of fear about us. the boats are driven apart, and we are alone at last under the incalculable sky, listless, diseased with stars.  let the oars be idle, my love, and forget at this time our love like a knife between us defining the boundaries that we can never cross nor destroy as we drift into the heart of our dream, cutting the silence, slyly, the bitter rain in our mouths and the dark wound closed in behind us.  forget depth-bombs, death and promises we made, gardens laid waste, and, over the wastelands westward, the rooms where we had come together bombd.  but even as we leave, your love turns back. i feel your absence like the ringing of bells silenced. and salt over your eyes and the scales of salt between us. now, you pass with ease into the destructive world. there is a dry crash of cement. the light fails, falls into the ruins of cities upon the distant shore and within the indestructible night i am alone.  
NEW POEM
 of course we knew the “incidents,” the aura of divinity, duck-and-cover in the parking garage, gloria swanson chinchilla redux, yes, he’d been a bombshell—the eyes still sang with the merriment of a punchbowl, fine wrists, that dahlia neck, skin bleached with peroxide, of course he swam in the nude, stashed gin in the toilet tank, stored stockings in the freezer so they wouldn’t run, had a thing for adenauer, played roulette with the .45 won in a cuban dancehall, raging along hallways, fathering four children, feeling the eyes of the back stairs, beck of the undercurrent, his own hand in his lap like an orphan, of course he gardened in dior, of course he was flagrant,  but what escaped us was the way he peeked into the neighbor’s kitchen drawers for something he swore they’d stolen, beyond the foreground obligation, aspiration insistent as a stuck car horn in the slow blue hours of morning, discarded affection, what escaped us was the dampness at the collarbone, the delicacy of the pose (cigarette and upturned cheek), the lingering by the kitchen knives, the bias cut off the dressing gown, break and fall, tumbrel of illusion—  and what we wanted to escape: that he was ruthless, beyond hope.  
NEW POEM
 from the cliff's edge, kicking her feet in panic and despair as the circle of light contracts and blackness takes the screen. and that is how we leave her, hanging—though we know she will be rescued, only to descend into fresh harm, the story flowing on, disaster and reprieve—systole, diastole—split rhythm of a heart that hungers  only to go on. so why is this like my mother, caged in a railed bed, each breath, a fresh installment in a tortured tale of capture and release? nine days she dangled, stubborn, over the abyss, the soft clay crumbling beneath her fingertips, until she dropped with a little bird cry of surprise into the swift river below.  here metaphor collapses, for there was no love to rescue her, no small boat waiting with a net to fish her out, although the water carried her, and it was april when we buried her among the weeping cherries and the waving flags and in the final fade, a heron breasted the far junipers to gain the tremulous air and swim away.  
NEW POEM
 there hangs this bellied pear, let no rake doubt, meat for the tongue and febrile to the skin, wasting for the mildew and the rot, a tallow rump slow rounded, a pelt thin and for the quickest bite; so, orchard bred, heaviest downward from the shaking stem. whose fingers curve around the ripened head lust to split so fine a diadem.  there is the picker, stretches for the knife, there are the ravening who claw the fruit, more, those adjuring wax that lasts a life, and foxes, freak for cunning, after loot. for that sweet suck the hornet whines his wits, but husbandman will dry her for the pits.   december 1951

 what are my friends? mouths, not eyes for bitterest underflesh of the farewell. i was a man and suffered like a girl. i spoke underneath to where the lights are  pretty, pretty, pretty whence they came to tell one god gets another. my friends are mouths for god, tearing me. in such a world broken only daughter opens to splendor.  my first thought was that dying is a deep well into the image of death, a many of one girl. later it meant to smile with no face, where mirrors are mouths. cupid and psyche wore  blindfolds made of glass, which explains why girls get to heaven early mornings adam fell. gods after gods we go. still later, friends shouldered high mountains to the lee shore.  gashed, and the gash a fountain of waters, the landscape defames a single flower: amaranth. magic hides an island world of boys and one daughter. i buried a pearl  in god’s eye. and yet he sees her, defames her, considers his time well spent imagining a continent of flowers whose final climate is a broken girl.  bells of a cretan woman in labor hurled from a tower, flesh realer than the ground she somehow upwards curled into the bloom of her groin where bells  are bees. i am an old man with a new beard. i am the offspring of my child sprung from hell. shipwreck makes peninsular metaphor out of my hatred, her rape, and one bell tower.  confusion suicides the poems, heaven i heard where the juice runs from stone-struck flowers. at the end of the world i must use proper violence. nothing is more true to tell.  tell the taut-strung higher calendars i’ve a margent in mind and new words hope to say, catastrophe to hear, old confederates and inwood apples  where apples never shone. also tell of mountains shouldered underneath one flower called amaranth. they tired of the world who made the world this way. god never  did, never will. if you were to call from the bottom of the ocean, the words, every one to me a living daughter, would shout wild mercy as never was before.

 let the bird of loudest lay on the sole arabian tree herald sad and trumpet be, to whose sound chaste wings obey.  but thou shrieking harbinger, foul precurrer of the fiend, augur of the fever's end, to this troop come thou not near.  from this session interdict every fowl of tyrant wing, save the eagle, feather'd king; keep the obsequy so strict.  let the priest in surplice white, that defunctive music can, be the death-divining swan, lest the requiem lack his right.  and thou treble-dated crow, that thy sable gender mak'st with the breath thou giv'st and tak'st, 'mongst our mourners shalt thou go.  here the anthem doth commence: love and constancy is dead; phoenix and the turtle fled in a mutual flame from hence.  so they lov'd, as love in twain had the essence but in one; two distincts, division none: number there in love was slain.  hearts remote, yet not asunder; distance and no space was seen 'twixt this turtle and his queen: but in them it were a wonder.  so between them love did shine that the turtle saw his right flaming in the phoenix' sight: either was the other's mine.  property was thus appalled that the self was not the same; single nature's double name neither two nor one was called.  reason, in itself confounded, saw division grow together, to themselves yet either neither, simple were so well compounded;  that it cried, "how true a twain seemeth this concordant one! love has reason, reason none, if what parts can so remain."  whereupon it made this threne to the phoenix and the dove, co-supremes and stars of love, as chorus to their tragic scene:  threnos   beauty, truth, and rarity, grace in all simplicity, here enclos'd, in cinders lie.  death is now the phoenix' nest, and the turtle's loyal breast to eternity doth rest,  leaving no posterity: 'twas not their infirmity, it was married chastity.  truth may seem but cannot be; beauty brag but 'tis not she; truth and beauty buried be.  to this urn let those repair that are either true or fair; for these dead birds sigh a prayer.

 they amputated your thighs off my hips. as far as i'm concerned they are all surgeons. all of them.  they dismantle us each from the other. as far as i'm concerned they are all engineers. all of them.  a pity. we were such a good and loving invention. an aeroplane made from a man and wife. wings and everything. we hovered a little above the earth.  we even flew a little.

 it was a beach like all beaches, only perhaps more beautiful. and the sand was pink not red.  we would arrive in caravans, hampers overflowing with food and drink like aziz and his party on the way to malabar.  the colonials and their servants away on an outing. we would stop under thatch umbrellas, towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea.  my mother in her skirted swim suit surrounded by fathers of other children, her olive skin lit through her straw hat.  they would laugh and drink beer and leer while the children did the usual beach things,  boring futile tunnels to china, running at waves and then away, daring each other to be swallowed.  i would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters, then give them to the men to pry open, cover with lime juice and suck dry.  once, i saw my mother sucking an oyster out of another daddy’s hand. her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue  searched the shell for pearls.  
NEW POEM
 please marry me. your mother likes me. —line spoken by an unknown woman, in a dream we are stretched out on a dingy sofa, and i think i must be barefoot because a woman whom no one knows is massaging the ankle of one leg of mine and the instep of the other, all this toward morning, and i have that occasional epiphany one has while still asleep that i am floating down a river because i am so happy and all the dismal issues have been made tractable at last, and so i say to her that the late symphonies of gustav mahler are more lucid if you’re sitting close to, and above, the orchestra, so that you can see the contrapuntal lines moving from strings to woodwinds and then back again, whereupon this woman, sitting (i now realize) at my feet, says, in the full heat of our dream life, and in that happiness, “please marry me. your mother likes me,” and so i wake, not laughing, although my mother  has been dead for over thirty years, but in wonderment over what quality this dream-woman must have owned to have pleased my mother so that she, my late mother, would have said, despite her ban on ordinary pleasantries, that she had liked someone, anyone, who might have cared for me, and as i lie in bed i think of the last movement of mahler’s ninth when the melodic lines go quiet for minute after minute in a prolonged farewell to music and to life, which my mother would attend to in her bathrobe late at night, the stereo turned up, blended whiskey in her highball glass mixed with milk as a disguise, leaning back, hand over eyes, silent-movie style like norma desmond listening as von stroheim plays the organ wearing his white gloves. no, it wasn’t mahler, it was schoenberg,verklärte nacht, moon-drunk music, mad and inconsolable.  
NEW POEM
 under the roof is the empty room papered in requiem blue.  partiers crowd the burned kitchen, gold fixtures hook to cheap lath.  what is it they can tell you about absence how it abates, takes names  becomes a wall with windows faced on a formal garden, content  to accept the thin rain. the syllable forgives the words that need it, a sentence  badly written, epigraphs scrawled thoughtlessly in books. book where the hero  confronts a dark riddle, book where the suitors stand at the gate and are stumped.  what force brought them forward stooping at the lintel, up the chipped steps  to the blue door in the unbuilt tower, half-built, the new stone.

 ventura because she was hungry and because she was curious—but more because she was curious— took the dare, a kiss for a pomegranate. everyone gathered, her friends and his. everyone watched: the boys, the girls, the pigs and the chickens, and more. moving to the front were the children she and clemente would one day have, and the children of those children, too, gathered and loud with everyone and everything else, loud as the pigs and fast as the chickens though she could not see them. still, they crowded her, and she could feel their anxious breathing. this boy clemente whom she would kiss she would have kissed even without the pomegranate, though she could not say it and was glad of this game. he suited her, she thought. he had a strong face. he felt what she felt. she could see him look around but not at their friends. she could see him feel the shiver of the children they would have: their son margarito, his two sisters both of whom would become nuns if just to pray enough to take care of him, this boy so serious he would seem like a stranger in their arms, serious enough by himself to make up for clemente and ventura and for all the laughter they themselves would feel, this curious child who, as an old man would never trust a doctor for anything. and his serious wife to come, refugio, and her sisters, matilde and consuelo as well, all the people who would follow this kiss, so many of them, and their children, too, everyone stood there, arms up, everyone watching, so much noise in this moment, this quick lending of herself to his cheek, the way ventura would later kiss all these impatient children of theirs. the kiss seemed so small, but was filled with itself. this small moment of affection she gave this boy the quarter-second that it took: there they all stood, waiting with the crowd egging them on, hefting the pomegranate and pushing them toward each other. clemente and ventura in that quarter-second lived their lives, a quarter-second not finished yet.

 there was a time when i watched it happen. strangers pressed to other strangers in one bed, clothes on, air humid with the cloying scent of fruit juice and vodka; none of us giving into another and yet unwilling to leave the scene of that possibility, pretending to sleep, actually sleeping. then waking again to slip a hand over a shoulder, slide a finger inside the waistband of a skirt; so young (we are even now still so young) in that hotel room turning blue then lighter blue. we wouldn’t have tried for more: the kiss, the button; firm, white shape of an image slipped wholly into the mind, acted upon, dreamed upon, filling the thin vessels of the lungs.  earlier, a film, its forced sounds of lovemaking. the tension i felt winding into the muscles of some of the others in the room. i remember i left for awhile. we all left for awhile; even the music was frightening. how to strip ourselves like that, point at the places that were wanted, plucked and peeled; speaking the words, hearing them form us, the nature of what we were and could do to each other? the music, the rocking, the sobbing. the man called the woman by parts of herself. some laughed at this. i remember i must have been one of them. in the morning, the hotel room was turning white. after the long night, hands were slipping and unslipping, moving over the flattened pillows as if in hopes something small could still satisfy us. someone turned and looked at someone else; we all heard it. legs shifted, sheets slid themselves down waists or shoulders, tightened again at the necks of those pretending to sleep as the unblinking sun crawled in our window. from another room, coughing, we all heard it. someone looked at someone else. the room turned white. the air began clearing.

 seeing in crowded restaurants the one you love you wave at the door, tall girl in imperious fur, and make for him, bumping waiters, dropping a glove, arriving soft with affectionate slur. as ladies half-turn, gazing, and men appraise you heap the linen with purse, scarf, cigarettes, lighter, laughing some instantaneous droll phrase. as if sudden sun came out, the table is brighter.  all moods: at a party everybody’s delight; intent while brown curls shadow the serious page; when people are stuffy (more correct than right) the stamp and turn on heel of a little girl’s rage. but woman mostly, as winter moonlight sees, impetuous midnight, and the dune’s dark trees.

 the pleasure of contrast: not chained up in an oilcoth sack underwater, holding his breath, but composing himself  for the camera, in his only suit. you have to understand photography— unforgiving mirror, unlike oils that soften  the hard edges of a man’s face if you want them to, or velvet curtain shielding the pine box during an escape.  the audience imagines his bones contracting to a splinter. that’s not at all how it’s done— the camera’s lens blanketed by cloth  to keep it in the dark; any halo of light ruptures the film with shadow. his eyes already turn inward to that place we’re going.  she thinks about escape too: at the horse butcher, in line like the others, or arguing over the price of bread  at the market of innocents. adam’s rib is forever hidden inside her chest as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer’s fist,  but she, at least, is smiling when he says, we have such a small family, meaning your body  won’t open to me—it’s shackled inside its cage: love and rage, whose bars are meant to be broken.  
NEW POEM
 there are two kinds of people, soldiers and women, as virginia woolf said. both for decoration only.  now that is too kind. it’s technical: virgins and wolves. we have choices now. two little girls walk into a bar,  one orders a shirley temple. shirley temple’s pimp comes over and says you won’t be sorry. she’s a fine  piece of work but she don’t come cheap. myself, i’m in less fear of predators than of walking around  in my mother’s body. that’s sneaky, that’s more than naked. let’s even it up: you go on fuming in your  gray room. i am voracious alone. blank and loose, metallic lingerie. and rare black-tipped cigarettes  in a handmade basket case. which of us weaves the world together with a quicker blur of armed  seduction: your war-on-thugs, my body stockings. ascetic or carnivore. men will crack your glaze  even if you leave them before morning. pigs ride the sirens in packs. ah, flesh, technoflesh,  there are two kinds of people. hot with mixed light, drunk on insult. you and me.

 nervy, sparrow-like, eyes cherokee, blackberry black, arrow-quick, picky eater, lean in spirit, converted quaker, she taught her grandson arithmetic and checkers tactics and let him touch through her cotton nightie small, tense nipples. her hands, arthritic, knitted doilies, breaded tomatoes, and put up apples, while the hoarded guilts made for bright quilts, the torrid migraines’ counterpanes.  
NEW POEM
 my hair is grey, but not with years, nor grew it white in a single night, as men's have grown from sudden fears: my limbs are bow'd, though not with toil, but rusted with a vile repose, for they have been a dungeon's spoil, and mine has been the fate of those to whom the goodly earth and air are bann'd, and barr'd—forbidden fare; but this was for my father's faith i suffer'd chains and courted death; that father perish'd at the stake for tenets he would not forsake; and for the same his lineal race in darkness found a dwelling place; we were seven—who now are one, six in youth, and one in age, finish'd as they had begun, proud of persecution's rage; one in fire, and two in field, their belief with blood have seal'd, dying as their father died, for the god their foes denied;— three were in a dungeon cast, of whom this wreck is left the last.  there are seven pillars of gothic mould, in chillon's dungeons deep and old, there are seven columns, massy and grey, dim with a dull imprison'd ray, a sunbeam which hath lost its way, and through the crevice and the cleft of the thick wall is fallen and left; creeping o'er the floor so damp, like a marsh's meteor lamp: and in each pillar there is a ring, and in each ring there is a chain; that iron is a cankering thing, for in these limbs its teeth remain, with marks that will not wear away, till i have done with this new day, which now is painful to these eyes, which have not seen the sun so rise for years—i cannot count them o'er, i lost their long and heavy score when my last brother droop'd and died, and i lay living by his side.  they chain'd us each to a column stone, and we were three—yet, each alone; we could not move a single pace, we could not see each other's face, but with that pale and livid light that made us strangers in our sight: and thus together—yet apart, fetter'd in hand, but join'd in heart, 'twas still some solace in the dearth of the pure elements of earth, to hearken to each other's speech, and each turn comforter to each with some new hope, or legend old, or song heroically bold; but even these at length grew cold. our voices took a dreary tone, an echo of the dungeon stone, a grating sound, not full and free, as they of yore were wont to be: it might be fancy—but to me they never sounded like our own.  i was the eldest of the three and to uphold and cheer the rest i ought to do—and did my best— and each did well in his degree. the youngest, whom my father loved, because our mother's brow was given to him, with eyes as blue as heaven— for him my soul was sorely moved: and truly might it be distress'd to see such bird in such a nest; for he was beautiful as day— (when day was beautiful to me as to young eagles, being free)— a polar day, which will not see a sunset till its summer's gone, its sleepless summer of long light, the snow-clad offspring of the sun: and thus he was as pure and bright, and in his natural spirit gay, with tears for nought but others' ills, and then they flow'd like mountain rills, unless he could assuage the woe which he abhorr'd to view below.  the other was as pure of mind, but form'd to combat with his kind; strong in his frame, and of a mood which 'gainst the world in war had stood, and perish'd in the foremost rank with joy:—but not in chains to pine: his spirit wither'd with their clank, i saw it silently decline— and so perchance in sooth did mine: but yet i forced it on to cheer those relics of a home so dear. he was a hunter of the hills, had followed there the deer and wolf; to him this dungeon was a gulf, and fetter'd feet the worst of ills.  lake leman lies by chillon's walls: a thousand feet in depth below its massy waters meet and flow; thus much the fathom-line was sent from chillon's snow-white battlement, which round about the wave inthralls: a double dungeon wall and wave have made—and like a living grave below the surface of the lake the dark vault lies wherein we lay: we heard it ripple night and day; sounding o'er our heads it knock'd; and i have felt the winter's spray wash through the bars when winds were high and wanton in the happy sky; and then the very rock hath rock'd, and i have felt it shake, unshock'd, because i could have smiled to see the death that would have set me free.  i said my nearer brother pined, i said his mighty heart declined, he loathed and put away his food; it was not that 'twas coarse and rude, for we were used to hunter's fare, and for the like had little care: the milk drawn from the mountain goat was changed for water from the moat, our bread was such as captives' tears have moisten'd many a thousand years, since man first pent his fellow men like brutes within an iron den; but what were these to us or him? these wasted not his heart or limb; my brother's soul was of that mould which in a palace had grown cold, had his free breathing been denied the range of the steep mountain's side; but why delay the truth?—he died. i saw, and could not hold his head, nor reach his dying hand—nor dead,— though hard i strove, but strove in vain, to rend and gnash my bonds in twain. he died—and they unlock'd his chain, and scoop'd for him a shallow grave even from the cold earth of our cave. i begg'd them, as a boon, to lay his corse in dust whereon the day might shine—it was a foolish thought, but then within my brain it wrought, that even in death his freeborn breast in such a dungeon could not rest. i might have spared my idle prayer— they coldly laugh'd—and laid him there: the flat and turfless earth above the being we so much did love; his empty chain above it leant, such murder's fitting monument!  but he, the favourite and the flower, most cherish'd since his natal hour, his mother's image in fair face the infant love of all his race his martyr'd father's dearest thought, my latest care, for whom i sought to hoard my life, that his might be less wretched now, and one day free; he, too, who yet had held untired a spirit natural or inspired— he, too, was struck, and day by day was wither'd on the stalk away. oh, god! it is a fearful thing to see the human soul take wing in any shape, in any mood: i've seen it rushing forth in blood, i've seen it on the breaking ocean strive with a swoln convulsive motion, i've seen the sick and ghastly bed of sin delirious with its dread: but these were horrors—this was woe unmix'd with such—but sure and slow: he faded, and so calm and meek, so softly worn, so sweetly weak, so tearless, yet so tender—kind, and grieved for those he left behind; with all the while a cheek whose bloom was as a mockery of the tomb whose tints as gently sunk away as a departing rainbow's ray; an eye of most transparent light, that almost made the dungeon bright; and not a word of murmur—not a groan o'er his untimely lot,— a little talk of better days, a little hope my own to raise, for i was sunk in silence—lost in this last loss, of all the most; and then the sighs he would suppress of fainting nature's feebleness, more slowly drawn, grew less and less: i listen'd, but i could not hear; i call'd, for i was wild with fear; i knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread would not be thus admonishèd; i call'd, and thought i heard a sound— i burst my chain with one strong bound, and rushed to him:—i found him not, i only stirred in this black spot, i only lived, i only drew the accursed breath of dungeon-dew; the last, the sole, the dearest link between me and the eternal brink, which bound me to my failing race was broken in this fatal place. one on the earth, and one beneath— my brothers—both had ceased to breathe: i took that hand which lay so still, alas! my own was full as chill; i had not strength to stir, or strive, but felt that i was still alive— a frantic feeling, when we know that what we love shall ne'er be so. i know not why i could not die, i had no earthly hope—but faith, and that forbade a selfish death.  what next befell me then and there i know not well—i never knew— first came the loss of light, and air, and then of darkness too: i had no thought, no feeling—none— among the stones i stood a stone, and was, scarce conscious what i wist, as shrubless crags within the mist; for all was blank, and bleak, and grey; it was not night—it was not day; it was not even the dungeon-light, so hateful to my heavy sight, but vacancy absorbing space, and fixedness—without a place; there were no stars, no earth, no time, no check, no change, no good, no crime but silence, and a stirless breath which neither was of life nor death; a sea of stagnant idleness, blind, boundless, mute, and motionless! a light broke in upon my brain,— it was the carol of a bird; it ceased, and then it came again, the sweetest song ear ever heard, and mine was thankful till my eyes ran over with the glad surprise, and they that moment could not see i was the mate of misery; but then by dull degrees came back my senses to their wonted track; i saw the dungeon walls and floor close slowly round me as before, i saw the glimmer of the sun creeping as it before had done, but through the crevice where it came that bird was perch'd, as fond and tame, and tamer than upon the tree; a lovely bird, with azure wings, and song that said a thousand things, and seemed to say them all for me! i never saw its like before, i ne'er shall see its likeness more: it seem'd like me to want a mate, but was not half so desolate, and it was come to love me when none lived to love me so again, and cheering from my dungeon's brink, had brought me back to feel and think. i know not if it late were free, or broke its cage to perch on mine, but knowing well captivity, sweet bird! i could not wish for thine! or if it were, in wingèd guise, a visitant from paradise; for—heaven forgive that thought! the while which made me both to weep and smile— i sometimes deem'd that it might be my brother's soul come down to me; but then at last away it flew, and then 'twas mortal well i knew, for he would never thus have flown— and left me twice so doubly lone,— lone as the corse within its shroud, lone as a solitary cloud, a single cloud on a sunny day, while all the rest of heaven is clear, a frown upon the atmosphere, that hath no business to appear when skies are blue, and earth is gay.  a kind of change came in my fate, my keepers grew compassionate; i know not what had made them so, they were inured to sights of woe, but so it was:—my broken chain with links unfasten'd did remain, and it was liberty to stride along my cell from side to side, and up and down, and then athwart, and tread it over every part; and round the pillars one by one, returning where my walk begun, avoiding only, as i trod, my brothers' graves without a sod; for if i thought with heedless tread my step profaned their lowly bed, my breath came gaspingly and thick, and my crush'd heart felt blind and sick. i made a footing in the wall, it was not therefrom to escape, for i had buried one and all, who loved me in a human shape; and the whole earth would henceforth be a wider prison unto me: no child, no sire, no kin had i, no partner in my misery; i thought of this, and i was glad, for thought of them had made me mad; but i was curious to ascend to my barr'd windows, and to bend once more, upon the mountains high, the quiet of a loving eye.  i saw them—and they were the same, they were not changed like me in frame; i saw their thousand years of snow on high—their wide long lake below, and the blue rhone in fullest flow; i heard the torrents leap and gush o'er channell'd rock and broken bush; i saw the white-wall'd distant town, and whiter sails go skimming down; and then there was a little isle, which in my very face did smile, the only one in view; a small green isle, it seem'd no more, scarce broader than my dungeon floor, but in it there were three tall trees, and o'er it blew the mountain breeze, and by it there were waters flowing, and on it there were young flowers growing, of gentle breath and hue. the fish swam by the castle wall, and they seem'd joyous each and all; the eagle rode the rising blast, methought he never flew so fast as then to me he seem'd to fly; and then new tears came in my eye, and i felt troubled—and would fain i had not left my recent chain; and when i did descend again, the darkness of my dim abode fell on me as a heavy load; it was as is a new-dug grave, closing o'er one we sought to save,— and yet my glance, too much opprest, had almost need of such a rest.  it might be months, or years, or days— i kept no count, i took no note— i had no hope my eyes to raise, and clear them of their dreary mote; at last men came to set me free; i ask'd not why, and reck'd not where; it was at length the same to me, fetter'd or fetterless to be, i learn'd to love despair. and thus when they appear'd at last, and all my bonds aside were cast, these heavy walls to me had grown a hermitage—and all my own! and half i felt as they were come to tear me from a second home: with spiders i had friendship made and watch'd them in their sullen trade, had seen the mice by moonlight play, and why should i feel less than they? we were all inmates of one place, and i, the monarch of each race, had power to kill—yet, strange to tell! in quiet we had learn'd to dwell; my very chains and i grew friends, so much a long communion tends to make us what we are:—even i regain'd my freedom with a sigh.

 in a movie i have never seen: a small-town drunk stumbles into a beam of light &amp; wakes up convinced he was abducted by aliens, convinced a hole opened in the sky &amp; swallowed him — said they did something strange to his body some kind of experiment, said a hole opened, said cold light cauterized him shut, redefined that red theory, chrome instrument turned him into a skinless puzzle, a scrambled egg sealed back into its shell. madness, too, can be accumulative. when my blood seemed uncontrollable, ran messy with pulp down their fingers, my cousins finally left the room, laughing closing the basement door behind them.  
NEW POEM
 everything’s been said but one last thing about the desert, and it’s awful: during brush fires in the sonoran desert, brush fires that happen before the monsoon and in the great, deep, wide, and smothering heat of the hottest months, the longest months, the hypnotic, immeasurable lulls of august and july— during these summer fires, jackrabbits— jackrabbits and everything else that lives in the brush of the rolling hills, but jackrabbits especially— jackrabbits can get caught in the flames, no matter how fast and big and strong and sleek they are. and when they’re caught, cornered in and against the thick trunks and thin spines of the cactus, when they can’t back up any more, when they can’t move, the flame— it touches them, and their fur catches fire. of course, they run away from the flame, finding movement even when there is none to be found, jumping big and high over the wave of fire, or backing even harder through the impenetrable tangle of hardened saguaro and prickly pear and cholla and barrel, but whichever way they find, what happens is what happens: they catch fire and then bring the fire with them when they run. they don’t know they’re on fire at first, running so fast as to make the fire shoot like rocket engines and smoke behind them, but then the rabbits tire and the fire catches up, stuck onto them like the needles of the cactus, which at first must be what they think they feel on their skins. they’ve felt this before, every rabbit. but this time the feeling keeps on. and of course, they ignite the brush and dried weeds all over again, making more fire, all around them. i’m sorry for the rabbits. and i’m sorry for us to know this.

 i guess you could call it a sort of sympathetic magic. how else to explain this obsessive reorganizing of my home, my books, my papers, my poems, this housekeeping of my hard drive and floppies, all the deleting and casting away of redundancy and obsolescence, dead files and moved-on addresses and the scrubbing, the constant scrubbing and dusting and the howl of the protesting vacuum that struggles to inhale at least the 70% of house-dust that is dead human skin some of which might be hers.

 my mother forgets to feed her animals because it's only fair. she rushes to them when she hears hoarse roosters crowing and billy goats butting over a last straw.  this month the moon becomes a princess. the stars fan her, jupiter pours cups of wine, mars sings melancholy mawals. bearded men holding prayer beads and yellow booklets stare at her and point aching fingers at her waist.  in our house we break a fast with dates from huun and glasses of buttermilk. then on to bowls of lamb soup flavored with mint, trays of stuffed grape leaves, spiced fava beans drenched in olive oil and lemon juice. and that is only the beginning.  the spirits of johnny walker and gin hide in the trunks of white peugeots. in the nightclubs of my city, waiters serve only non-alcoholic beer and belly dancers cover themselves.  father of sixteen children, our neighbor visits bringing two kilos of baklava. he washes them down with a dozen demitasses of sweet sage tea. before dawn he runs to one of his two wives, both named salma, and loves her hurriedly, his hands barely touching a breast.

 this sweater is made from only the finest, softest underhairs of the mongolian camel. “fancy-schmancy,” my father would have said, whose snazziest sweater was still a declassé synthetic from the sweatshops of taiwan. my friend deloris, however, who really owns such clothes, would say “exquisite” or “sublime”—her opened closet’s row of shoulders teases late-day bedroomlight along such textures, there are days when the laboring brain and throbbing crotch appear to us to be not much more than her wardrobe’s tasteful accessories. “. . . woven from genital-down of prepubescent yeti, and then hand-sewn in our undersea domes.” “untouched by anyone other than albino elves, this wool is . . . .”  ______________   rarefied—to helthi hart, the diet guru, it’s a cup of clear organic cauliflower broth. and for the emperor excessia, it’s a mad dessert of swans’ tongues —there were, what? ten thousand?—dipped in a slip of stiffening honey and set out to await the banqueteers like a field of fresh shoots they could graze. some roman party hosts had great roped bowls of snow brought from the mountaintops to entertain their guests with dishes of rose-petal sherbet and chilled roe. they might even allow the household slaves to slide leftover snow along the burning welts the ropes ate into their shoulders all down the mountainside.  ______________  afterwards it was an unrecognizable tatter. but an image of my father’s worn-thin bargain city “all-weather” jacket is still whole in its polyester glory. this is what happened: the alley dog (he later called the thing a “cur”) had cornered livia, and she screamed once, with a seven-year-old’s unselfconscious terror. and then my father was there, with his jacket wound around his arm, and a rock. when it was over, he tore the sleeves off, tied the poor dog quiet and, after comforting livia, they both kneeled down to comfort the dog. he was like that. and the jacket that served as weapon and restraint?—was like him, every day of his life. it did what was needed.  ______________   i misread “migraine.” which of the two would we call the most rarefied? “margarine”? or maybe comparison isn’t the point. a ghost is a person rarefied through the fine, fine colander death; that doesn’t make, for most of us, extinction an ideal. it was hard to think of frank and deloris divorcing, since it was hard to imagine the two of them engaging in anything so mundane as sex or rage or envy with the rest of the hoi polloi. they seemed unearthly in close to a literal way, like radio waves. and yet divorce they did. they found something real they could unjoin, hertz from hertz until there just was air.  ______________  a dream: we own the softest of the soft mongolian camel underhair sweaters. one day (we think we’re doing the “right thing”) we release it into the wild, to romp with its brother and sister desert sweaters, out where it “belongs.” you know, however, what happens by now: it’s unfit to fend for itself amid that hardened herd. they beat it. it’s hungry. it crawls back into the city, mewing, curling up at night against a door my father opens and, seeing something in need, brings it inside, wraps it in flannel. that’s how he was. he’d give you the cheap shirt off his back.

 all the sioux were defeated. our clan got poor, but a few got richer. they fought two wars. i did not take part. no one remembers your vision or even your real name. now the children go to town and like loud music. i married a christian.  crazy horse, it is not fair to hide a new vision from you. in our schools we are learning to take aim when we talk, and we have found out our enemies. they shift when words do; they even change and hide in every person. a teacher here says hurt or scorned people are places where real enemies hide. he says we should not hurt or scorn anyone, but help them. and i will tell you in a brave way, the way crazy horse talked: that teacher is right.  i will tell you a strange thing: at the rodeo, close to the grandstand, i saw a farm lady scared by a blown piece of paper; and at that place horses and policemen were no longer frightening, but suffering faces were, and the hunched-over backs of the old.  crazy horse, tell me if i am right: these are the things we thought we were doing something about.  in your life you saw many strange things, and i will tell you another: now i salute the white man’s flag. but when i salute i hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat and remember all of us and how we depend on a steady pulse together. there are those who salute because they fear other flags or mean to use ours to chase them: i must not allow my part of saluting to mean this. all of our promises, our generous sayings to each other, our honorable intentions—those i affirm when i salute. at these times it is like shutting my eyes and joining a religious colony at prayer in the gray dawn in the deep aisles of a church.  now i have told you about new times. yes, i know others will report different things. they have been caught by weak ways. i tell you straight the way it is now, and it is our way, the way we were trying to find.  the chokecherries along our valley still bear a bright fruit. there is good pottery clay north of here. i remember our old places. when i pass the musselshell i run my hand along those old grooves in the rock.

 maurice, weep not, i am not here under this pine tree. the balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass, the stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls, but thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous in the blest nirvana of eternal light! go to the good heart that is my husband, who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh i won spirit, and through spirit, peace. there is no marriage in heaven, but there is love.

 of course i chose the terry cloth surrogate. milkless artifice. false idol. everyone, i’m told, has a mother,  but master bred me in a laboratory, his colony of orphans. rhesus macaque.macaca mulatta. old world monkeys, my matriarchs ruled the grasslands  and forests long before white men like him weaned their whiteness and maleness from our chromosomes,  slashed and burned our home, what they once called the orient. french indochina. việt nam. master, like a good despot, besotted and dumbstruck, dying  to discern the genesis of allegiance, the science of love and loss, nature versus nurture, segregated me at birth  from my maker, pelt sopping with placental blood. in a chamber where he kept track of me, his pupils recorded my every movement, my every utterance,  hoping i might evince to them a part of themselves. but i wasn’t stupid. i knew famine and emaciation,  and nevertheless i picked that lifeless piece of shit because it was soft to hold. who wouldn’t want that? though it couldn’t hold me, i clung to the yellow-face  devil as though it was my true mother and i grasped the function of motherhood: witness to my suffering,  companion in hell. unlike infants with wire mothers i didn’t hurl myself on the floor in terror or tantrum, rocking back and forth, colder than a corpse. i had  what master believed to be a psychological base of operations. emotional attachment. autonomy.  everything he denied and did to me, his ceaseless cruelty concealed as inquisition, unthinkable until it was thought, i endured by keeping for myself  the wisdom he yearned to discover and take credit for. love, like me, is a beast no master can maim,  no dungeon can discipline. love is at once master and dungeon. so don’t underestimate me. simple- minded and subservient as i might appear to be,  i gathered more about master than he did about me, which, i guess, is a kind of fidelity  conceived not from fondness but fear magnified by fascination. master made me his terry cloth surrogate, his red-clawed god, nursing his id  on my tits, and for that, i pitied him. all this time he was the animal. all this time he belonged to me.

 a man and a woman are sitting at a table. it is supper time. the air is green. the walls are white in the green air, as rocks under water retain their own true color, though washed in green. i do not know either the man or the woman, nor do i know whatever they know of each other. though washed in my eye they keep their own true color.  the man is all his own hunched strength, the body’s self and strength, that bears, like weariness, itself upon itself, as a stone’s weight bears heavily on itself to be itself. heavy the strength that bears the body down. and the way he feeds is like a dreamless sleep. the dreaming of a stone is how he feeds.  the woman’s arms are plump, mottled a little the flesh, like standing milk, and on one arm a blue bruise, got in some household labor or other, flowering in the white. her staring eye, like some bird’s cry called from some deepest wood, says nothing of what it is but what it is. such silence is the bird’s cry of the stone.

 it is not that i love you less than when before your feet i lay, but to prevent the sad increase of hopeless love, i keep away.  in vain (alas!) for everything which i have known belong to you, your form does to my fancy bring, and makes my old wounds bleed anew.  who in the spring from the new sun already has a fever got, too late begins those shafts to shun, which phœbus through his veins has shot.  too late he would the pain assuage, and to thick shadows does retire; about with him he bears the rage, and in his tainted blood the fire.  but vow’d i have, and never must your banish’d servant trouble you; for if i break, you may distrust the vow i made to love you, too.

 on sullen nights like these when my spirit counts its woes like pearls on a string, you bring me armfuls of spare pantsuits and clear-eyed hints about the woman who might kick up her heels in them, flooding rooms with cunning, air, an almost gaudy vitality.  gaudy but sober: when your wayward husband courted the heiress, you stormed her gates disguised as a floozy—and asked the butler to serve you gingerale. it was life you’d rather be drunk on, roaring life that told you there is no time for spirits of dark staircases, only lightning ruses that not only leave no bruises but give all parties their wish: rinsed vision and second chances.  losing a boot heel and giddily claiming i was born on the side of a hill is easy. for every such moment there are ten when my ideal snags midflight, a bag caught in branches. but a girl can dream, can realize, high on heroines, that she is mortal and therefore fearless; that sanity supplies the ground bass to the wildest singing; that breezes made visible make the finest winds.

 on the rough diamond, the hand-cut field below the dog lot and barn, we rehearsed the strict technique of bunting. i watched from the infield, the mound, the backstop as your left hand climbed the bat, your legs and shoulders squared toward the pitcher. you could drop it like a seed down either base line. i admired your style, but not enough to take my eyes off the bank that served as our center-field fence.  years passed, three leagues of organized ball, no few lives. i could homer into the left-field lot of carmichael motors, and still you stressed the same technique, the crouch and spring, the lead arm absorbing just enough impact. that whole tiresome pitch about basics never changing, and i never learned what you were laying down.  like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap, let this be the sign i’m getting a grip on the sacrifice.

 the strings, as if they knew the lovers are about to meet, begin to soar, and when he marches in the door they soar some more—half ecstasy, half pain, the musical equivalent of rain— while children who have grown up with one stare steal further looks across a crowded room, as goners tend to do.  my father loved it too, warned me at dinner that he’d be a wreck long before the final trio came (ja,ja, she sighed, and gave him up forever); he found his sophie better late than never and took the fifth about his silent tears but like him i’m a softie, with a massive gift for feeling blue.  i went with others, threw bouquets and caution to the whirling wind, believing that the rhapsody on stage would waft its wonders up to our cheap seats; but mirrors can be beautiful fierce cheats, delusions of an over-smitten mind; i relished trouser roles until i had no petals left to strew.  up, down the avenue i wandered like a ghost, i wondered why a miracle is always a mirage, then plodded home and set back all the clocks, spent hard-won funds installing strong new locks, telling myself if violence like this could never sound like violins, i would to art, not life, be true.  and i am trying to fathom the way i got from there to here, the joy that snuck up when i’d sworn off joy: we’ve made a sterling start, we’ve got a plan to watch it on your satin couch downtown and i’ll be there upon the stroke of eight, bearing in my trembling ungloved hand a silver rose for you.

 since so ye please to hear me plain, and that ye do rejoice my smart, me list no lenger to remain to such as be so overthwart.  but cursed be that cruel heart which hath procur’d a careless mind for me and mine unfeigned smart, and forceth me such faults to find.  more than too much i am assured of thine intent, whereto to trust; a speedless proof i have endured, and now i leave it to them that lust.  
NEW POEM
 the front seats filled last. laggards, buffoons, and kiss-ups falling in beside local politicos, the about to be honored, and the hard of hearing.  no help from the middle, blenders and criminals. and the back rows: restless, intelligent, unable to commit. my place was always left-center, a little to the rear.  the shy sat with me, fearful of discovery. behind me the dead man’s illegitimate children and the bride’s and groom’s former lovers.  there, when lights were lowered, hands plunged under skirts or deftly unzipped flies, and, lights up again, rose and pattered in applause.  ahead, the bored practiced impeccable signatures. but was it a movie or a singing? i remember the whole crowd uplifted, but not the event  or the word that brought us together as one— one, i say now, when i had felt myself many, speaking and listening: that was the contradiction.  
NEW POEM
 heard you that shriek? it rose so wildly on the air, it seem’d as if a burden’d heart was breaking in despair.  saw you those hands so sadly clasped— the bowed and feeble head— the shuddering of that fragile form— that look of grief and dread?  saw you the sad, imploring eye? its every glance was pain, as if a storm of agony were sweeping through the brain.  she is a mother pale with fear, her boy clings to her side, and in her kyrtle vainly tries his trembling form to hide.  he is not hers, although she bore for him a mother’s pains; he is not hers, although her blood is coursing through his veins!  he is not hers, for cruel hands may rudely tear apart the only wreath of household love that binds her breaking heart.  his love has been a joyous light that o’er her pathway smiled, a fountain gushing ever new, amid life’s desert wild.  his lightest word has been a tone of music round her heart, their lives a streamlet blent in one— oh, father! must they part?  they tear him from her circling arms, her last and fond embrace. oh! never more may her sad eyes gaze on his mournful face.  no marvel, then, these bitter shrieks disturb the listening air: she is a mother, and her heart is breaking in despair.

 wise emblem of our politic world, sage snail, within thine own self curl’d; instruct me softly to make haste, whilst these my feet go slowly fast.  compendious snail! thou seem’st to me, large euclid’s strict epitome; and in each diagram dost fling thee from the point unto the ring; a figure now triangular, an oval now, and now a square; and then a serpentine dost crawl, now a straight line, now crook’d, now all.  preventing rival of the day, th’art up and openest thy ray, and ere the morn cradles the moon th’art broke into a beauteous noon. then when the sun sups in the deep, thy silver horns ere cynthia’s peep; and thou from thine own liquid bed new phoebus heav’st thy pleasant head.  who shall a name for thee create, deep riddle of mysterious state? bold nature that gives common birth to all products of seas and earth, of thee, as earthquakes, is afraid, nor will thy dire deliv’ry aid.  thou thine own daughter then, and sire, that son and mother art entire, that big still with thy self dost go, and liv’st an aged embryo; that like the cubs of india, thou from thyself a while dost play; but frighted with a dog or gun, in thine own belly thou dost run, and as thy house was thine own womb, so thine own womb concludes thy tomb.  but now i must (analyz’d king) thy economic virtues sing; thou great stay’d husband still within, thou, thee, that’s thine dost discipline; and when thou art to progress bent, thou mov’st thy self and tenement, as warlike scythians travell’d, you remove your men and city too; then after a sad dearth and rain, thou scatterest thy silver train; and when the trees grow nak’d and old, thou clothest them with cloth of gold, which from thy bowels thou dost spin, and draw from the rich mines within.  now hast thou chang’d thee saint; and made thy self a fane that’s cupola’d; and in thy wreathed cloister thou walkest thine own grey friar too; strict, and lock’d up, th’art hood all o’er, and ne’er eliminat’st thy door. on salads thou dost feed severe, and ’stead of beads thou dropp’st a tear; and when to rest, each calls the bell, thou sleep’st within thy marble cell, where in dark contemplation plac’d, the sweets of nature thou dost taste; who now with time thy days resolve, and in a jelly thee dissolve, like a shot star, which doth repair upward, and rarify the air.  
NEW POEM
 when the snake bit rabbi hanina ben dosa while he was praying  the snake died. (each day is attended by surprises or it is nothing.)  question: was the bare-footed, smelly rabbi more poisonous than the snake  or so god-adulterated he’d become immune to serpent poison?  oh great-great-great-uncles, your palms weighing air, why are you arguing?  listen, the snake thought (being old and unwell and bad-tempered as hell)  death, where’s thy sting? in short, was just testing: a snake’s last fling.  yes, the so-called snake was dying anyway, its heart calcified and as old as eden.  no, that snake was a1 fit but while hissing for fun it clumsily bit its own tongue.  no, hanina invented that snake; not for his own sake but for first- class, religious publicity.  no no, here’s the key to it. ask: did the rabbi, later on, become a jumpy, timid man?  remember, he who has been bitten by a snake thereafter becomes frightened of a rope …  bearded men in darkening rooms sipping lemon tea and arguing about the serpent till the moon  of russia, of latvia, lithuania, poland, rose above the alien steeples—centuries of sleep.  now, tonight, a clean-shaven rabbi who once studied in vienna says snake-venom contains  haemolysins, haemo- coagulants, protolysins, cytolysins and neurotoxins  and that even in hanina ben dosa’s day a snake was a snake—unless, of course, it was  a penis, an unruly penis, making a noise like one pissing on a mound of fresh hot ashes.  oh great-great-great-uncles did you hear him? and are your handbones weighing moonshine?  
NEW POEM
 white people leave the express at 96th street, collectively, like pigeons from a live wire or hope from the hearts of harlem. and i’m one of them, although my lover sleeps two stops north between malcolm x and adam clayton powell boulevards, wishing my ass were cupped inside her knees and belly, wishing this in a dream thick with inequalities.  i live on riverside drive. my face helped get me here. i was ruddy with anticipation the day i interviewed for the rooms near the park with its snow-covered maples. i was full of undisguised hope as i strolled along the river, believing i belonged there, that my people inherited this wonderland unequivocally, as if they deserved it.  my lover buys twinkies from the arabs, bootleg tapes on ‘25 th , and carries a blade in her back pocket although her hands are the gentlest i’ve known. she ignores the piss smells on the corner, the sirens at 4 a.m., the men whose brains have dissolved in rum. and tries to trust a white woman who sleeps near the trees of riverside.  when we go out together, we avoid expensive cafés on columbus avenue, jaunts to the upper east side. harlem eyes us suspiciously or with contempt beneath half-closed lids. we have friends there, hidden in the ruins like gold, who accept us. when it snows, we walk boldly anywhere, as if the snow were a protection, or a death.  
NEW POEM
 in case you sit across from the meteorologist tonight, and in case the dim light over the booth in the bar still shines almost planetary on your large, smooth, winter-softened forehead, in case all of the day—its woods and play, its fire— has stayed on your beard, and will stay through the slight drift of mouth, the slackening of even your heart's muscle— . . . well. i am filled with snow. there's nothing to do now but wait.  
NEW POEM
 it was at a wine party— i lay in a drowse, knowing it not. the blown flowers fell and filled my lap. when i arose, still drunken, the birds had all gone to their nests, and there remained but few of my comrades. i went along the river—alone in the moonlight.  
NEW POEM
 i am watching the movie twelve angry men because there is a character in it who reminds me of him.  he is the one who wants to go to the baseball game instead of decide on a man’s life, he is the weak one, the one afraid to reveal what he really feels, the one for whom everything is a joke. he is not henry fonda, the tight-lipped moral one.  the man is despicable, his weaknesses obvious to all, as obvious as henry fonda’s goodness. i watch the movie again and again, loving the black and white of it, soothed by the sound of my father’s voice, the careless pronunciation, the easy shrugging of the shoulders at every crucial question.  i sink lower into the dark arms of the sofa. strange how comfortable the familiar is, how we can even prefer it, however terrifying.

NEW POEM
 how sweet i roam'd from field to field, and tasted all the summer's pride, 'till i the prince of love beheld, who in the sunny beams did glide!  he shew'd me lilies for my hair, and blushing roses for my brow; he led me through his gardens fair, where all his golden pleasures grow.  with sweet may dews my wings were wet, and phoebus fir'd my vocal rage; he caught me in his silken net, and shut me in his golden cage.  he loves to sit and hear me sing, then, laughing, sports and plays with me; then stretches out my golden wing, and mocks my loss of liberty.  
NEW POEM
 if you refuse me once, and think again, i will complain. you are deceiv’d, love is no work of art, it must be got and born, not made and worn, by every one that hath a heart.  or do you think they more than once can die, whom you deny? who tell you of a thousand deaths a day, like the old poets feign and tell the pain they met, but in the common way?  or do you think ’t too soon to yield, and quit the field? nor is that right, they yield that first entreat; once one may crave for love, but more would prove this heart too little, that too great.  oh that i were all soul, that i might prove for you as fit a love as you are for an angel; for i know, none but pure spirits are fit loves for you.  you are all ethereal; there’s in you no dross, nor any part that’s gross. your coarsest part is like a curious lawn, the vestal relics for a covering drawn.  your other parts, part of the purest fire that e’er heav’n did inspire, makes every thought that is refin’d by it a quintessence of goodness and of wit.  thus have your raptures reach’d to that degree in love’s philosophy, that you can figure to yourself a fire void of all heat, a love without desire.  nor in divinity do you go less; you think, and you profess, that souls may have a plenitude of joy, although their bodies meet not to employ.  but i must needs confess, i do not find the motions of my mind so purified as yet, but at the best my body claims in them an interest.  i hold that perfect joy makes all our parts as joyful as our hearts. our senses tell us, if we please not them, our love is but a dotage or a dream.  how shall we then agree? you may descend, but will not, to my end. i fain would tune my fancy to your key, but cannot reach to that obstructed way.  there rests but this, that whilst we sorrow here, our bodies may draw near; and, when no more their joys they can extend, then let our souls begin where they did end.  
NEW POEM
 there's a place i know where the birds swing low, and wayward vines go roaming, where the lilacs nod, and a marble god is pale, in scented gloaming. and at sunset there comes a lady fair whose eyes are deep with yearning. by an old, old gate does the lady wait her own true love's returning.  but the days go by, and the lilacs die, and trembling birds seek cover; yet the lady stands, with her long white hands held out to greet her lover. and it's there she'll stay till the shadowy day a monument they grave her. she will always wait by the same old gate, — the gate her true love gave her.  
NEW POEM
 1  i celebrate myself, and sing myself, and what i assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.  i loafe and invite my soul, i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.  my tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air, born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same, i, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin, hoping to cease not till death.  creeds and schools in abeyance, retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten, i harbor for good or bad, i permit to speak at every hazard, nature without check with original energy.  2  houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes, i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it, the distillation would intoxicate me also, but i shall not let it.  the atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless, it is for my mouth forever, i am in love with it, i will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked, i am mad for it to be in contact with me.  the smoke of my own breath, echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine, my respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs, the sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn, the sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind, a few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms, the play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, the delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides, the feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.  have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much? have you practis’d so long to learn to read? have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?  stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems, you shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,) you shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books, you shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, you shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.  3  i have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end, but i do not talk of the beginning or the end.  there was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now, and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.  urge and urge and urge, always the procreant urge of the world.  out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex, always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.  to elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.  sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams, stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, i and this mystery here we stand.  clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.  lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen, till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.  showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age, knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss i am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.  welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean, not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.  i am satisfied—i see, dance, laugh, sing; as the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread, leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty, shall i postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, that they turn from gazing after and down the road, and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?  4  trippers and askers surround me, people i meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city i live in, or the nation, the latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new, my dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues, the real or fancied indifference of some man or woman i love, the sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations, battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events; these come to me days and nights and go from me again, but they are not the me myself.  apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am, stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary, looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, looking with side-curved head curious what will come next, both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.  backward i see in my own days where i sweated through fog with linguists and contenders, i have no mockings or arguments, i witness and wait.  5  i believe in you my soul, the other i am must not abase itself to you, and you must not be abased to the other.  loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat, not words, not music or rhyme i want, not custom or lecture, not even the best, only the lull i like, the hum of your valvèd voice.  i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me, and parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, and reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.  swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth, and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own, and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own, and that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers, and that a kelson of the creation is love, and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields, and brown ants in the little wells beneath them, and mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.  6  a child said what is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands; how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is any more than he.  i guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.  or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord, a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say whose?  or i guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.  or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, and it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, growing among black folks as among white, kanuck, tuckahoe, congressman, cuff, i give them the same, i receive them the same.  and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.  tenderly will i use you curling grass, it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men, it may be if i had known them i would have loved them, it may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps, and here you are the mothers’ laps.  this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers, darker than the colorless beards of old men, dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.  o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues, and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.  i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, and the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.  what do you think has become of the young and old men? and what do you think has become of the women and children?  they are alive and well somewhere, the smallest sprout shows there is really no death, and if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it, and ceas’d the moment life appear’d.  all goes onward and outward, nothing collapses, and to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.  7  has any one supposed it lucky to be born? i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and i know it.  i pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots, and peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good, the earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.  i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth, i am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself, (they do not know how immortal, but i know.)  every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female, for me those that have been boys and that love women, for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted, for me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers, for me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears, for me children and the begetters of children.  undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded, i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no, and am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.  8  the little one sleeps in its cradle, i lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.  the youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill, i peeringly view them from the top.  the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom, i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, i note where the pistol has fallen.  the blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders, the heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor, the snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls, the hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs, the flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital, the meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall, the excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd, the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes, what groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits, what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes, what living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum, arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips, i mind them or the show or resonance of them—i come and i depart.  9  the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready, the dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon, the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged, the armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.  i am there, i help, i came stretch’d atop of the load, i felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other, i jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy, and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.  10  alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt, wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee, in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night, kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game, falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.  the yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,  my eyes settle the land, i bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.  the boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me, i tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time; you should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.  i saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl, her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders, on a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand, she had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.  the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside, i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile, through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak, and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him, and brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet, and gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes, and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness, and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles; he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north, i had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.  11  twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore, twenty-eight young men and all so friendly; twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.  she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank, she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.  which of the young men does she like the best? ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.  where are you off to, lady? for i see you, you splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.  dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather, the rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.  the beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair, little streams pass’d all over their bodies.  an unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies, it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.  the young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them, they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch, they do not think whom they souse with spray.  12  the butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market, i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.  blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil, each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.  from the cinder-strew’d threshold i follow their movements, the lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms, overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure, they do not hasten, each man hits in his place.  13  the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain, the negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece, his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band, his glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead, the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.  i behold the picturesque giant and love him, and i do not stop there, i go with the team also.  in me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing, to niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing, absorbing all to myself and for this song.  oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes? it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life.  my tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble, they rise together, they slowly circle around.  i believe in those wing’d purposes, and acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me, and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional, and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else, and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me, and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.  14  the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night, ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation, the pert may suppose it meaningless, but i listening close, find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.  the sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog, the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats, the brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings, i see in them and myself the same old law.  the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections, they scorn the best i can do to relate them.  i am enamour’d of growing out-doors, of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods, of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses, i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.  what is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is me, me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns, adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me, not asking the sky to come down to my good will, scattering it freely forever.  15  the pure contralto sings in the organ loft, the carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp, the married and unmarried children ride home to their thanksgiving dinner, the pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm, the mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,  the duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches, the deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar, the spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel, the farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a first-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye, the lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case, (he will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;) the jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case, he turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript; the malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table, what is removed drops horribly in a pail; the quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove, the machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass, the young fellow drives the express-wagon, (i love him, though i do not know him;) the half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race, the western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs, out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece; the groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee, as the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle, the bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other, the youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain, the wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the huron, the squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale, the connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways, as the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers, the young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots, the one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child, the clean-hair’d yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill, the paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold, the canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread, the conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him, the child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions, the regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!) the drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray, the pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;) the bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly, the opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips, the prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck, the crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other, (miserable! i do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;) the president holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great secretaries, on the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms, the crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold, the missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle, as the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change, the floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar, in single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers; seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!) seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground; off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface, the stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe, flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees, coon-seekers go through the regions of the red river or through those drain’d by the tennessee, or through those of the arkansas, torches shine in the dark that hangs on the chattahooche or altamahaw,  patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them, in walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport, the city sleeps and the country sleeps, the living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time, the old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife; and these tend inward to me, and i tend outward to them, and such as it is to be of these more or less i am, and of these one and all i weave the song of myself.  16  i am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise, regardless of others, ever regardful of others, maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine, one of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same, a southerner soon as a northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the oconee i live, a yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth, a kentuckian walking the vale of the elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a louisianian or georgian, a boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a hoosier, badger, buckeye; at home on kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off newfoundland, at home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking, at home on the hills of vermont or in the woods of maine, or the texan ranch, comrade of californians, comrade of free north-westerners, (loving their big proportions,) comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat, a learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest, a novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons, of every hue and caste am i, of every rank and religion, a farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker, prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.  i resist any thing better than my own diversity, breathe the air but leave plenty after me, and am not stuck up, and am in my place.  (the moth and the fish-eggs are in their place, the bright suns i see and the dark suns i cannot see are in their place, the palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)  17  these are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me, if they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing, if they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing, if they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.  this is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is, this the common air that bathes the globe.  18  with music strong i come, with my cornets and my drums, i play not marches for accepted victors only, i play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.  have you heard that it was good to gain the day? i also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.  i beat and pound for the dead, i blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.  vivas to those who have fail’d! and to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! and to those themselves who sank in the sea! and to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes! and the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!  19  this is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger, it is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, i make appointments with all, i will not have a single person slighted or left away, the kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited, the heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited; there shall be no difference between them and the rest.  this is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair, this the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning, this the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face, this the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.  do you guess i have some intricate purpose? well i have, for the fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.  do you take it i would astonish? does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods? do i astonish more than they?  this hour i tell things in confidence, i might not tell everybody, but i will tell you.  20  who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude; how is it i extract strength from the beef i eat?  what is a man anyhow? what am i? what are you?  all i mark as my own you shall offset it with your own, else it were time lost listening to me.  i do not snivel that snivel the world over, that months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.  whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d, i wear my hat as i please indoors or out.  why should i pray? why should i venerate and be ceremonious?  having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close, i find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.  in all people i see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less, and the good or bad i say of myself i say of them.  i know i am solid and sound, to me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, all are written to me, and i must get what the writing means.  i know i am deathless, i know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass, i know i shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.  i know i am august, i do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, i see that the elementary laws never apologize, (i reckon i behave no prouder than the level i plant my house by, after all.)  i exist as i am, that is enough, if no other in the world be aware i sit content, and if each and all be aware i sit content.  one world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself, and whether i come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years, i can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness i can wait.  my foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite, i laugh at what you call dissolution, and i know the amplitude of time.  21  i am the poet of the body and i am the poet of the soul, the pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me, the first i graft and increase upon myself, the latter i translate into a new tongue.  i am the poet of the woman the same as the man, and i say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man, and i say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.  i chant the chant of dilation or pride, we have had ducking and deprecating about enough, i show that size is only development.  have you outstript the rest? are you the president? it is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.  i am he that walks with the tender and growing night, i call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.  press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night! night of south winds—night of the large few stars! still nodding night—mad naked summer night.  smile o voluptuous cool-breath’d earth! earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt! earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue! earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river! earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake! far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth! smile, for your lover comes.  prodigal, you have given me love—therefore i to you give love! o unspeakable passionate love.  22  you sea! i resign myself to you also—i guess what you mean, i behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers, i believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me, we must have a turn together, i undress, hurry me out of sight of the land, cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse, dash me with amorous wet, i can repay you.  sea of stretch’d ground-swells, sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths, sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves, howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea, i am integral with you, i too am of one phase and of all phases.  partaker of influx and efflux i, extoller of hate and conciliation, extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.  i am he attesting sympathy, (shall i make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)  i am not the poet of goodness only, i do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.  what blurt is this about virtue and about vice? evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, i stand indifferent, my gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait, i moisten the roots of all that has grown.  did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy? did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?  i find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance, soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine, thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.  this minute that comes to me over the past decillions, there is no better than it and now.  what behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder, the wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.  23  endless unfolding of words of ages! and mine a word of the modern, the word en-masse.  a word of the faith that never balks, here or henceforward it is all the same to me, i accept time absolutely.  it alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all, that mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.  i accept reality and dare not question it, materialism first and last imbuing.  hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration! fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac, this is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches, these mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas. this is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.  gentlemen, to you the first honors always! your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling, i but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.  less the reminders of properties told my words, and more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication, and make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt, and beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.  24  walt whitman, a kosmos, of manhattan the son, turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding, no sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest.  unscrew the locks from the doors! unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!  whoever degrades another degrades me, and whatever is done or said returns at last to me.  through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.  i speak the pass-word primeval, i give the sign of democracy, by god! i will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.  through me many long dumb voices, voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves, voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs, voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, and of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff, and of the rights of them the others are down upon, of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised, fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.  through me forbidden voices, voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and i remove the veil, voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.  i do not press my fingers across my mouth, i keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart, copulation is no more rank to me than death is.  i believe in the flesh and the appetites, seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.  divine am i inside and out, and i make holy whatever i touch or am touch’d from, the scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer, this head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.  if i worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it, translucent mould of me it shall be you! shaded ledges and rests it shall be you! firm masculine colter it shall be you! whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you! you my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life! breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you! my brain it shall be your occult convolutions! root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you! mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you! trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you! sun so generous it shall be you! vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you! you sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you! winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you! broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you! hands i have taken, face i have kiss’d, mortal i have ever touch’d, it shall be you.  i dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious, each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy, i cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish, nor the cause of the friendship i emit, nor the cause of the friendship i take again.  that i walk up my stoop, i pause to consider if it really be, a morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.  to behold the day-break! the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows, the air tastes good to my palate.  hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding, scooting obliquely high and low.  something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs, seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.  the earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction, the heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head, the mocking taunt, see then whether you shall be master!  25  dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me, if i could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.  we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun, we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.  my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach, with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.  speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself, it provokes me forever, it says sarcastically, walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?  come now i will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation, do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded? waiting in gloom, protected by frost, the dirt receding before my prophetical screams, i underlying causes to balance them at last, my knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things, happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)  my final merit i refuse you, i refuse putting from me what i really am, encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me, i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.  writing and talk do not prove me, i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face, with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic.  26  now i will do nothing but listen, to accrue what i hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.  i hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals, i hear the sound i love, the sound of the human voice, i hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following, sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night, talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals, the angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick, the judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence, the heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters, the ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights, the steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars, the slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two, (they go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)  i hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,) i hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears, it shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.  i hear the chorus, it is a grand opera, ah this indeed is music—this suits me.  a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me, the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.  i hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?) the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies, it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess’d them, it sails me, i dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves, i am cut by bitter and angry hail, i lose my breath, steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,  at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles, and that we call being.  27  to be in any form, what is that? (round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,) if nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.  mine is no callous shell, i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop, they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.  i merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy, to touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as i can stand.  28  is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity, flames and ether making a rush for my veins, treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them, my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself, on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs, straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip, behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, depriving me of my best as for a purpose, unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist, deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields, immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me, no consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger, fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while, then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.  the sentries desert every other part of me, they have left me helpless to a red marauder, they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.  i am given up by traitors, i talk wildly, i have lost my wits, i and nobody else am the greatest traitor, i went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.  you villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat, unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.  29  blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch! did it make you ache so, leaving me?  parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan, rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.  sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital, landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.  30  all truths wait in all things, they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it, they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon, the insignificant is as big to me as any, (what is less or more than a touch?)  logic and sermons never convince, the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.  (only what proves itself to every man and woman is so, only what nobody denies is so.)  a minute and a drop of me settle my brain, i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps, and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman, and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other, and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, and until one and all shall delight us, and we them.  31  i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars, and the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, and the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest, and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, and the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue, and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.  i find i incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, and am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over, and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons, but call any thing back again when i desire it.  in vain the speeding or shyness, in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach, in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones, in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes, in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low, in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky, in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs, in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods, in vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to labrador, i follow quickly, i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.  32  i think i could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d, i stand and look at them long and long.  they do not sweat and whine about their condition, they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god, not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things, not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.  so they show their relations to me and i accept them, they bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.  i wonder where they get those tokens, did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?  myself moving forward then and now and forever, gathering and showing more always and with velocity, infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them, not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers, picking out here one that i love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.  a gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses, head high in the forehead, wide between the ears, limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground, eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.  his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him, his well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.  i but use you a minute, then i resign you, stallion, why do i need your paces when i myself out-gallop them? even as i stand or sit passing faster than you.  33  space and time! now i see it is true, what i guess’d at, what i guess’d when i loaf’d on the grass, what i guess’d while i lay alone in my bed, and again as i walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.  my ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps, i skirt sierras, my palms cover continents, i am afoot with my vision.  by the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen, along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed, weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests, prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase, scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river, where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter, where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish, where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou, where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail; over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field, over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters, over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax, over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest, over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze; scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs, walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush, where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot, where the bat flies in the seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark, where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow, where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides, where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters; where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders, wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs, where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,) where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand, where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it, where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke, where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water, where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents, where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below; where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments, approaching manhattan up by the long-stretching island, under niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance, upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside, upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball, at he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter, at the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw, at apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find, at musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings; where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps, where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel, where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen, where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks, where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie, where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near, where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding, where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh, where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds, where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out, where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery, where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees, where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs, where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon, where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well, through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves, through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs, through the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall; pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old, pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome, pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously, pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church, pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting; looking in at the shop-windows of broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass, wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach, my right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and i in the middle; coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,) far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print, by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient, nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle; voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure, hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any, hot toward one i hate, ready in my madness to knife him, solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while, walking the old hills of judæa with the beautiful gentle god by my side, speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars, speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles, speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest, carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly, storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, backing and filling, appearing and disappearing, i tread day and night such roads.  i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product, and look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.  i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul, my course runs below the soundings of plummets.  i help myself to material and immaterial, no guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.  i anchor my ship for a little while only, my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.  i go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.  i ascend to the foretruck, i take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest, we sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough, through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty, the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions, the white-topt mountains show in the distance, i fling out my fancies toward them, we are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged, we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution, or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city, the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.  i am a free companion, i bivouac by invading watchfires, i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself, i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.  my voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs, they fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.  i understand the large hearts of heroes, the courage of present times and all times, how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and death chasing it up and down the storm, how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights, and chalk’d in large letters on a board,be of good cheer, we will not desert you; how he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up, how he saved the drifting company at last, how the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves, how the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men; all this i swallow, it tastes good, i like it well, it becomes mine, i am the man, i suffer’d, i was there.  the disdain and calmness of martyrs, the mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on, the hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat, the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets, all these i feel or am.  i am the hounded slave, i wince at the bite of the dogs, hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen, i clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin, i fall on the weeds and stones, the riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.  agonies are one of my changes of garments, i do not ask the wounded person how he feels, i myself become the wounded person, my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe.  i am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken, tumbling walls buried me in their debris, heat and smoke i inspired, i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades, i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels, they have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.  i lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake, painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy, white and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps, the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.  distant and dead resuscitate, they show as the dial or move as the hands of me, i am the clock myself.  i am an old artillerist, i tell of my fort’s bombardment, i am there again.  again the long roll of the drummers, again the attacking cannon, mortars, again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.  i take part, i see and hear the whole, the cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots, the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip, workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs, the fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion, the whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.  again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand, he gasps through the clot mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.  34  now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth, (i tell not the fall of alamo, not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo, the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo,) ’tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.  retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks, nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance, their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone, they treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.  they were the glory of the race of rangers, matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship, large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate, bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters, not a single one over thirty years of age.  the second first-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer, the work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.  none obey’d the command to kneel, some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight, a few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together, the maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there, some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away, these were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets, a youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him, the three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.  at eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies; that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.  35  would you hear of an old-time sea-fight? would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? list to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.  our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you, (said he,) his was the surly english pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be; along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.  we closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d, my captain lash’d fast with his own hands.  we had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water, on our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.  fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark, ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported, the master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.  the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.  our frigate takes fire, the other asks if we demand quarter? if our colors are struck and the fighting done?  now i laugh content, for i hear the voice of my little captain, we have not struck, he composedly cries,we have just begun our part of the fighting.  only three guns are in use, one is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast, two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.  the tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top, they hold out bravely during the whole of the action.  not a moment’s cease, the leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.  one of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.  serene stands the little captain, he is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low, his eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.  toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.  36  stretch’d and still lies the midnight, two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness, our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d, the captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet, near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin, the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers, the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below, the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars, cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves, black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent, a few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, the hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan, these so, these irretrievable.  37  you laggards there on guard! look to your arms! in at the conquer’d doors they crowd! i am possess’d! embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering, see myself in prison shaped like another man, and feel the dull unintermitted pain.  for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch, it is i let out in the morning and barr’d at night.  not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but i am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side, (i am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)  not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too, and am tried and sentenced.  not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp, my face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.  askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in them, i project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.  38  enough! enough! enough! somehow i have been stunn’d. stand back! give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping, i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.  that i could forget the mockers and insults! that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers! that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.  i remember now, i resume the overstaid fraction, the grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves, corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.  i troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession, inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines, our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth, the blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.  eleves, i salute you! come forward! continue your annotations, continue your questionings.  39  the friendly and flowing savage, who is he? is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?  is he some southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he kanadian? is he from the mississippi country? iowa, oregon, california? the mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?  wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him, they desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.  behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté, slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations, they descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers, they are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.  40  flaunt of the sunshine i need not your bask—lie over! you light surfaces only, i force surfaces and depths also.  earth! you seem to look for something at my hands, say, old top-knot, what do you want?  man or woman, i might tell how i like you, but cannot, and might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot, and might tell that pining i have, that pulse of my nights and days.  behold, i do not give lectures or a little charity, when i give i give myself.  you there, impotent, loose in the knees, open your scarf’d chops till i blow grit within you, spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets, i am not to be denied, i compel, i have stores plenty and to spare, and any thing i have i bestow.  i do not ask who you are, that is not important to me, you can do nothing and be nothing but what i will infold you.  to cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies i lean, on his right cheek i put the family kiss, and in my soul i swear i never will deny him.  on women fit for conception i start bigger and nimbler babes. (this day i am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)  to any one dying, thither i speed and twist the knob of the door. turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed, let the physician and the priest go home.  i seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will, o despairer, here is my neck, by god, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.  i dilate you with tremendous breath, i buoy you up, every room of the house do i fill with an arm’d force, lovers of me, bafflers of graves.  sleep—i and they keep guard all night, not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you, i have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself, and when you rise in the morning you will find what i tell you is so.  41  i am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs, and for strong upright men i bring yet more needed help.  i heard what was said of the universe, heard it and heard it of several thousand years; it is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?  magnifying and applying come i, outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, taking myself the exact dimensions of jehovah, lithographing kronos, zeus his son, and hercules his grandson, buying drafts of osiris, isis, belus, brahma, buddha, in my portfolio placing manito loose, allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved, with odin and the hideous-faced mexitli and every idol and image, taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more, admitting they were alive and did the work of their days, (they bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,) accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman i see, discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house, putting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel, not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation, lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars, minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction, their brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames; by the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born, three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their waists, the snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come, selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery; what was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then, the bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough, dung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d, the supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes, the day getting ready for me when i shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious; by my life-lumps! becoming already a creator, putting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.  42  a call in the midst of the crowd, my own voice, orotund sweeping and final.  come my children, come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates, now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.  easily written loose-finger’d chords—i feel the thrum of your climax and close.  my head slues round on my neck, music rolls, but not from the organ, folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.  ever the hard unsunk ground, ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides, ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real, ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts, ever the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth, ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life, ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.  here and there with dimes on the eyes walking, to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning, tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going, many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving, a few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.  this is the city and i am one of the citizens, whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools, the mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.  the little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats, i am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,) i acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me, what i do and say the same waits for them, every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.  i know perfectly well my own egotism, know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less, and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.  not words of routine this song of mine, but abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring; this printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy? the well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms? the black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and engineers? in the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes? the sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way? the saints and sages in history—but you yourself? sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain, and what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?  43  i do not despise you priests, all time, the world over, my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths, enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern, believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years, waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun, making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis, helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist, drinking mead from the skull-cup, to shastas and vedas admirant, minding the koran, walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, accepting the gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, to the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew, ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me, looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land, belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.  one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.  down-hearted doubters dull and excluded, frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical, i know every one of you, i know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.  how the flukes splash! how they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!  be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers, i take my place among you as much as among any, the past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same, and what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.  i do not know what is untried and afterward, but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.  each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.  it cannot fail the young man who died and was buried, nor the young woman who died and was put by his side, nor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again, nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder, nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity, nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in, nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth, nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them, nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.  44  it is time to explain myself—let us stand up.  what is known i strip away, i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown.  the clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?  we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers, there are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.  births have brought us richness and variety, and other births will bring us richness and variety.  i do not call one greater and one smaller, that which fills its period and place is equal to any.  were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister? i am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me, all has been gentle with me, i keep no account with lamentation, (what have i to do with lamentation?)  i am an acme of things accomplish’d, and i an encloser of things to be.  my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs, on every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps, all below duly travel’d, and still i mount and mount.  rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, afar down i see the huge first nothing, i know i was even there, i waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist, and took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.  long i was hugg’d close—long and long.  immense have been the preparations for me, faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.  cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen, for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings, they sent influences to look after what was to hold me.  before i was born out of my mother generations guided me, my embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.  for it the nebula cohered to an orb, the long slow strata piled to rest it on, vast vegetables gave it sustenance, monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.  all forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me, now on this spot i stand with my robust soul.  45  o span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity! o manhood, balanced, florid and full.  my lovers suffocate me, crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night, crying by day ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head, calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, lighting on every moment of my life, bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.  old age superbly rising! o welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!  every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself, and the dark hush promulges as much as any.  i open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.  wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding, outward and outward and forever outward.  my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels, he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit, and greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.  there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage, if i, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run, we should surely bring up again where we now stand, and surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.  a few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient, they are but parts, any thing is but a part.  see ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that, count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.  my rendezvous is appointed, it is certain, the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms, the great camerado, the lover true for whom i pine will be there.  46  i know i have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.  i tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!) my signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods, no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair, i have no chair, no church, no philosophy, i lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange, but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll, my left hand hooking you round the waist, my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.  not i, not any one else can travel that road for you, you must travel it for yourself.  it is not far, it is within reach, perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know, perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.  shoulder your duds dear son, and i will mine, and let us hasten forth, wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.  if you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip, and in due time you shall repay the same service to me, for after we start we never lie by again.  this day before dawn i ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven, and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then? and my spirit said no, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.  you are also asking me questions and i hear you, i answer that i cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.  sit a while dear son, here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink, but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, i kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.  long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams, now i wash the gum from your eyes, you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.  long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore, now i will you to be a bold swimmer, to jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.  47  i am the teacher of athletes, he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own, he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.  the boy i love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right, wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear, fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak, unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts, first-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo, preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers, and those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.  i teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me? i follow you whoever you are from the present hour, my words itch at your ears till you understand them.  i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat, (it is you talking just as much as myself, i act as the tongue of you, tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)  i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house, and i swear i will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.  if you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore, the nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key, the maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.  no shutter’d room or school can commune with me, but roughs and little children better than they.  the young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well, the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day, the farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice, in vessels that sail my words sail, i go with fishermen and seamen and love them.  the soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine, on the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and i do not fail them, on that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.  my face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket, the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon, the young mother and old mother comprehend me, the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are, they and all would resume what i have told them.  48  i have said that the soul is not more than the body, and i have said that the body is not more than the soul, and nothing, not god, is greater to one than one’s self is, and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud, and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times, and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero, and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe, and i say to any man or woman, let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.  and i say to mankind, be not curious about god, for i who am curious about each am not curious about god, (no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death.)  i hear and behold god in every object, yet understand god not in the least, nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.  why should i wish to see god better than this day? i see something of god each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then, in the faces of men and women i see god, and in my own face in the glass, i find letters from god dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by god’s name, and i leave them where they are, for i know that wheresoe’er i go, others will punctually come for ever and ever.  49  and as to you death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.  to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes, i see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting, i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, and mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.  and as to you corpse i think you are good manure, but that does not offend me, i smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, i reach to the leafy lips, i reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.  and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before.)  i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven, o suns—o grass of graves—o perpetual transfers and promotions, if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing?  of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck, toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.  i ascend from the moon, i ascend from the night, i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected, and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.  50  there is that in me—i do not know what it is—but i know it is in me.  wrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes, i sleep—i sleep long.  i do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid, it is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.  something it swings on more than the earth i swing on, to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.  perhaps i might tell more. outlines! i plead for my brothers and sisters.  do you see o my brothers and sisters? it is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is happiness.  51  the past and present wilt—i have fill’d them, emptied them, and proceed to fill my next fold of the future.  listener up there! what have you to confide to me? look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening, (talk honestly, no one else hears you, and i stay only a minute longer.)  do i contradict myself? very well then i contradict myself, (i am large, i contain multitudes.)  i concentrate toward them that are nigh, i wait on the door-slab.  who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper? who wishes to walk with me?  will you speak before i am gone? will you prove already too late?  52  the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.  i too am not a bit tamed, i too am untranslatable, i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  the last scud of day holds back for me, it flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds, it coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.  i depart as air, i shake my white locks at the runaway sun, i effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.  i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love, if you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.  you will hardly know who i am or what i mean, but i shall be good health to you nevertheless, and filter and fibre your blood.  failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, missing me one place search another, i stop somewhere waiting for you.

 the late gracie allen was a very lucid comedienne, especially in the way that lucid means shining and bright. what her husband george burns called her illogical logic made a halo around our syntax and ourselves as we laughed.  george burns most often was her artful inconspicuous straight man. he could move people about stage, construct skits and scenes, write and gather jokes. they were married as long as ordinary magic would allow, thirty-eight years, until gracie allen's death.  in her fifties gracie allen developed a heart condition. she would call george burns when her heart felt funny and fluttered he'd give her a pill and they'd hold each other till the palpitation stopped—just a few minutes, many times and pills. as magic fills then fulfilled must leave a space, one day gracie allen's heart fluttered and hurt and stopped. george burns said unbelievingly to the doctor, "but i still have some of the pills."

 a man talking to his ex-wife on the phone. he has loved her voice and listens with attention to every modulation of its tone. knowing it intimately. not knowing what he wants from the sound of it, from the tendered civility. he studies, out the window, the seed shapes of the broken pods of ornamental trees. the kind that grow in everyone’s garden, that no one but horticulturists can name. four arched chambers of pale green, tiny vegetal proscenium arches, a pair of black tapering seeds bedded in each chamber. a wish geometry, miniature, indian or persian, lovers or gods in their apartments. outside, white, patient animals, and tangled vines, and rain.

 what is your substance, whereof are you made, that millions of strange shadows on you tend? since every one hath, every one, one shade, and you, but one, can every shadow lend. describe adonis, and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you; on helen's cheek all art of beauty set, and you in grecian tires are painted new. speak of the spring and foison of the year: the one doth shadow of your beauty show, the other as your bounty doth appear; and you in every blessèd shape we know. in all external grace you have some part, but you like none, none you, for constant heart.  
NEW POEM
 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. in me thou see'st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west, which by and by black night doth take away, death's second self, that seals up all in rest. in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the death-bed whereon it must expire, consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by. this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well which thou must leave ere long.

 when they did greet me father, sudden awe weigh'd down my spirit! i retired and knelt seeking the throne of grace, but inly felt no heavenly visitation upwards draw my feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart. ah me! before the eternal sire i brought the unquiet silence of confused thought and shapeless feelings: my o'erwhelmed heart trembled: &amp; vacant tears stream'd down my face. and now once more, o lord! to thee i bend, lover of souls! and groan for future grace, that, ere my babe youth's perilous maze have trod, thy overshadowing spirit may descend and he be born again, a child of god!

 as the storm-struck oak leaned closer to the house — the remaining six-story half of the tree listing toward the glass box of  the kitchen like someone in the first tilt of stumbling — the other half crashed into the neighbors’ yards, a massive diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for an antler dropped by a constellation — as the ragged half   leaned nearer, the second storm of cloying snow began pulling on the shocked, still-looming splitting, and its branches dragged lower like ripped hems it was tripping over until they rustled on the roof under which i quickly made dinner, each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently said, thank goodness for our tree, how it has accompanied us all these years, thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over the little lot of our yard, thank goodness for the birdsong and  squirrel games which keep us from living alone, and for its proffered shade, the crack of the bat resounding through september when its dime-sized acorns land on the tin awning next door. have mercy on us, you, the massively beautiful, now ravaged and charged with destruction. we did speak like that. as if from a book of psalms because it took up the sky

 to keep from ending the story does everything it can, careful not to overvalue perfection or undervalue perfect chance, as i am careful not to do in telling. by now a lot has happened: bridges under the water, no time outs, sinewy voices from under the earth braiding and going straight up in a faint line. i modify to simplify, complicate to clarify. if you want to know your faults, marry. if you want to know your virtues, die. then the heroine, who resembles you in certain particulars, precipitates the suicide of the author, wretchedly obscure, of that slim but turgid volume, by letting slip: real events don't have endings, only the stories about them do.  
NEW POEM
 after thomas james the strangers in the woods must mimic squirrels and crackle with the undergrowth. they must not flinch at the cruelty of breaking golden leaves with their feet, or of interring stones. and like any of these deciduous trees in autumn they must be  stingy with shadow and move deceptively across the sludge. i listen to these strangers stirring with the evenings. i invent paths for them to the soft edge of the lake. each descent is as graceful as a sinking ship, but less tragic somehow because these strangers  don’t possess a lung. i cannot hear them breathe, yet the air is all whispers, all sighs—the same ethereal muscle that rubs the color off the foliage. i lost my way out of the woods on the night every bird went south or numb. a plump rat snatched the moon  and dragged it by the white rope of its tail. the strangers were a cloak of silhouettes flattening against a trunk like bark. i must have disappeared among them because the mouth i touched was not my own and was cruelly closing in on someone’s rib. i carried  such a bite on me, an arc of green and yellow on my side from the man who said he loved me. in that darkness i knew as much about him as i did of the amputee swimming his way up the hill with his only arm. so this is the home of the unturned stone where  the fugitive keeps his kiss! archeologists will discover a paradise in the place no touch died of neglect. is it any wonder all things forgotten or abandoned find their way here? the winter is back, so too the bloated body of a book i tossed over the bridge last week.  and there on the bench, is my old smoking habit, a cigarette glowing on my mouth like a beacon. i’m patient, waiting for the fugitive to claim me as his own. i’m as wise as any stranger here, alone but with the knowledge that the grief of separation is always brief.  
NEW POEM
 last summer, two discrete young snakes left their skin on my small porch, two mornings in a row. being  postmodern now, i pretended as if i did not see them, nor understand what i knew to be circling  inside me. instead, every hour i told my son to stop with his incessant back-chat. i peeled  a banana. and cursed god—his arrogance, his gall—to still expect our devotion  after creating love. and mosquitoes. i showed my son the papery dead skins so he could  know, too, what it feels like when something shows up at your door—twice—telling you what you already know.  
NEW POEM
 inamoratas, with an approbation, bestowed his title. blessed his inclination.  he wakes, unwinds, elaborately: a cat tawny, reluctant, royal. he is fat and fine this morning. definite. reimbursed.  he waits a moment, he designs his reign, that no performance may be plain or vain. then rises in a clear delirium.  he sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days. and his desertedness, his intricate fear, the postponed resentments and the prim precautions.  now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender or take away the power of his pine? what smelly substitute, heady as wine, would you provide? life must be aromatic. there must be scent, somehow there must be some. would you have flowers in his life? suggest asters? a really good geranium? a white carnation? would you prescribe a show with the cold lilies, formal chrysanthemum magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic red of prize roses? might his happiest alternative (you muse) be, after all, a bit of gentle garden in the best of taste and straight tradition? maybe so. but you forget, or did you ever know, his heritage of cabbage and pigtails, old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails, down in the deep (but always beautiful) south where roses blush their blithest (it is said) and sweet magnolias put chanel to shame.  no! he has not a flower to his name. except a feather one, for his lapel. apart from that, if he should think of flowers it is in terms of dandelions or death. ah, there is little hope. you might as well— unless you care to set the world a-boil and do a lot of equalizing things, remove a little ermine, say, from kings, shake hands with paupers and appoint them men, for instance—certainly you might as well leave him his lotion, lavender and oil.  let us proceed. let us inspect, together with his meticulous and serious love, the innards of this closet. which is a vault whose glory is not diamonds, not pearls, not silver plate with just enough dull shine. but wonder-suits in yellow and in wine, sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt. with shoulder padding that is wide and cocky and determined as his pride; ballooning pants that taper off to ends scheduled to choke precisely. here are hats like bright umbrellas; and hysterical ties like narrow banners for some gathering war.  people are so in need, in need of help. people want so much that they do not know.  below the tinkling trade of little coins the gold impulse not possible to show or spend. promise piled over and betrayed.  these kneaded limbs receive the kiss of silk. then they receive the brave and beautiful embrace of some of that equivocal wool. he looks into his mirror, loves himself— the neat curve here; the angularity that is appropriate at just its place; the technique of a variegated grace.  here is all his sculpture and his art and all his architectural design. perhaps you would prefer to this a fine value of marble, complicated stone. would have him think with horror of baroque, rococo. you forget and you forget.  he dances down the hotel steps that keep remnants of last night’s high life and distress. as spat-out purchased kisses and spilled beer. he swallows sunshine with a secret yelp. passes to coffee and a roll or two. has breakfasted. out. sounds about him smear, become a unit. he hears and does not hear the alarm clock meddling in somebody’s sleep; children’s governed sunday happiness; the dry tone of a plane; a woman’s oath; consumption’s spiritless expectoration; an indignant robin’s resolute donation pinching a track through apathy and din; restaurant vendors weeping; and the l that comes on like a slightly horrible thought.  pictures, too, as usual, are blurred. he sees and does not see the broken windows hiding their shame with newsprint; little girl with ribbons decking wornness, little boy wearing the trousers with the decentest patch, to honor sunday; women on their way from “service,” temperate holiness arranged ably on asking faces; men estranged from music and from wonder and from joy but far familiar with the guiding awe of foodlessness. he loiters. restaurant vendors weep, or out of them rolls a restless glee. the lonesome blues, the long-lost blues, i want a big fat mama. down these sore avenues comes no saint-saëns, no piquant elusive grieg, and not tschaikovsky’s wayward eloquence and not the shapely tender drift of brahms. but could he love them? since a man must bring to music what his mother spanked him for when he was two: bits of forgotten hate, devotion: whether or not his mattress hurts: the little dream his father humored: the thing his sister did for money: what he ate for breakfast—and for dinner twenty years ago last autumn: all his skipped desserts.  the pasts of his ancestors lean against him. crowd him. fog out his identity. hundreds of hungers mingle with his own, hundreds of voices advise so dexterously he quite considers his reactions his, judges he walks most powerfully alone, that everything is—simply what it is.  but movie-time approaches, time to boo the hero’s kiss, and boo the heroine whose ivory and yellow it is sin for his eye to eat of. the mickey mouse, however, is for everyone in the house.  squires his lady to dinner at joe’s eats. his lady alters as to leg and eye, thickness and height, such minor points as these, from sunday to sunday. but no matter what her name or body positively she’s in queen lace stockings with ambitious heels  that strain to kiss the calves, and vivid shoes frontless and backless, chinese fingernails, earrings, three layers of lipstick, intense hat dripping with the most voluble of veils. her affable extremes are like sweet bombs about him, whom no middle grace or good could gratify. he had no education in quiet arts of compromise. he would not understand your counsels on control, nor thank you for your late trouble. at joe’s eats you get your fish or chicken on meat platters. with coleslaw, macaroni, candied sweets, coffee and apple pie. you go out full. (the end is—isn’t it?—all that really matters.)  and even and intrepid come the tender boots of night to home.  her body is like new brown bread under the woolworth mignonette. her body is a honey bowl whose waiting honey is deep and hot, her body is like summer earth, receptive, soft, and absolute ...

 i think of the man who sat behind my grandmother’s sister in church and told her the percentage of indian in her blood, calling it out over the white pews. i wonder what made him want to count it like coins or a grade. i wish i could hear him now when i think of her saying that all the wampanoag blood in her body would fit in one finger, discounting the percentage it seemed, but why was she such a historian, tracing the genealogy of the last wampanoag up to her own children, typing it all on see-through paper? maybe like me she felt a little self-conscious caring about what we’re made of instead of simply being satisfied dressing our bodies and driving them around. maybe she felt shy for loving someone she’d never met, i mean i do. i think of the knife cutting into flesh and the fork carrying it

 two sisters of ancient greece both laid claim to the finest, fairest rear of their time. which tail forged ahead? which bottom’s true fame topped? which back was in front, which terce most prime? a judge chose the elder girl’s back matter; her finish was more fine and far matter. she got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed. “but the younger’s sitter’s not a smatter less meet; i’ll marry her,” his brother said. it went so well, their joys were so perfected, that after them a temple was erected in honor of  venus callipygus. no other church — though i don’t know its rite — could so, from head to epididymis, move me with deep devotion to its site.  translated from the french of  jean de la fontaine, contes , part i, 6.

 after  jean-michel basquiat crows and more crows. one crow with a rat hanging from its beak, sloppy and beautiful. another crow with its wings plucked empty. i wanted so much of today to be peaceful but the empty crow untethers something in me: a feral yearning for love or a love that is so full of  power, of  tenderness, the words fall to their knees begging for mercy like tulips in wind. i don’t wear the crown for the times power has tainted my body, but i can tell the difference between giving up and giving in. if  you can’t, ask the crow that watches me through the window, laughing as i drink my third bottle of wine. ask the sound the tree makes when the crow has grown disgusted with my whining. after years of repression, i can come clean. i was a boy with a hole other boys stuffed themselves into. i have wanted nothing to do with blackness or laughter or my life. but about love, who owns the right, really? who owns the crow who loves fresh meat or the crow who loves the vibration of its own throat? everything around me is black for its own good, i suppose. the widow, the picture of the boy crying on the wall, the mirror with its taunting, the crows that belong to their scripture. can you imagine being so tied to blackness that even your wings cannot help you escape? about my life, every needle, a small prayer. every pill, a funeral hymn. i wanted the end several times but thought, who owns this body, really? god? dirt? the silly insects that will feast on my decay? is it the boy who entered first or the boy who wanted everything to last?  
NEW POEM
 sex is always monstrous. blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body. “please touch me there. more. oh god.” for a hitchhiker, the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift, itchy, unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway. it is often the sex of another era, in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed.  i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me, ultra-american, like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick. at first, my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian; after all, it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons. again, this is an example of departure in another time. as a foreign student on scholarship, it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdie’s early works. nevertheless: “how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders, who come over here and . . . the university, as an institution, really needs to be more accountable. we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information. they need to do their course work and then they need to go home.”  i didn’t want to go home. this is a boring sentence. perhaps for you oregon is a calming word, evoking images of blackberry pie, ocean vistas, and the capture of suspected felons. i had never heard the word oregon before. like the distance of scotland from london, it seemed impossibly far. a beautiful hazard: to go and keep going. how can i put this? in england, nobody ever, ever, ever did this. i, who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar, in a dinged-up datsun cherry, was considered an anomaly. “are you demented? why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland? it’s seven hours on the m1, man!” though, outwardly, i was wan and somewhat reticent, i . . . no, i was. my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position, from that angle, resembled two fried eggs. we were meeting in a park as per the era. i am sure contemporary punjabi-british teenagers are fearless individuals, undaunted by the prospect of community censure. back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench, on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades. it is always a century. in my century, sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my father’s car forever. “are you out of your bleeding head? your dad’s going to skin you alive!”  in some sense, this (driving) is the opposite of hitchhiking, in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar. the day was real in a different way back then, in the way that it sensitized me to risk, a kind of twin to permisson. two black swans: that day and this one, history and fiction, what i went for and what i really wanted, which i didn’t know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible, considering the trouble i was already in and the rain, which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets; the streetlamps were pink.  on prince street, in glasgow, i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café. the tables were coated with green plastic. there was hot tea, which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white, blocky rose with a pink dot at its center. “charles rennie mackintosh,” the waitress, pronouncing “osh” so that it rhymed with horse. “are you from india?” “would you like some jam with that scone? i bet they don’t have scones in india, do they?” “more tea? i heard you have a lot of tea, over there, isn’t that right?”  plan b: the extension of my throat. the euphoria of theft. other countries with their sayings and beliefs. the original plan, formulated by my father during his morning communte across london: marrying a british-born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin, but not too brown, and rosy cheeks. note on the mantelpiece, tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva: what is forthcoming under the original plan? extraction? what kind of sex is possible on the dentist’s chair late at night for that girl, your girl, who nervously asks for a blanket? she has her socks on. she’s shivering. it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients, but in this scene the limbs of the dentist’s young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash. dad, “please don’t swallow.” rinse then spit. spit then swallow.  i could not go home and so, after a brief visit to the hill house—charles rennie mackintosh’s art deco home on the firth of clyde, where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy, as it seemed from the décor—i turned left and kept driving. i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving, my chest very tight beneath the surface. it was difficult to feel anything or really to see, and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean. this is going. damaged, washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later, my car failed to start. this is later, when the car stopped, and, looking up from my hands, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, i realized that i was okay.  now i am here, in the future of color. i’m sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival. i am not interested in it. i do not recall it. i . . . it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do, on my own terms, with my own two legs: get going. is that how you say it? get up and go. the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood: i came here to hitchhike. i came here to complete a thing i began in another place. removing wet pages from my rucksack, i lay them on the shore, securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles. when they dried, i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket, next to my body. misshapen, exhilarated, i said get. i said go. get up now and go. “are you okay?” “do you need a ride somewhere?” “let me look in the trunk. i might have something in there. here you go. you’re shivering! do you need to go to the hospital? at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.”  
NEW POEM
 in the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels from the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth dragging along empty granary floors. between us and them stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices.  transfixed or transformed by this pain? we never know because who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow toward both the past and present? fire, flood, famine— all we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch  back and taunt us with their persistence. we track them down to a quick end. more come. and the old memories grow new. the future seems already written with a pen of iron. the book unreadable, immense. the enemy has become our masterpiece.  
NEW POEM
 to mama who on the eve of my birth beat a bitch with a kool-aid spoon for taking her eldest child’s red balloon (if i wasn’t wet-fisted, all hemmed up inside cecelia, i’da jumped in)  to the bazaar of milk &amp; afterbirth that once was her body, piping hot almond dark with laughter &amp; memories of fenced-in two-stepping late night in a brownsville park  to mama’s hands, mad stallions pummeling dough for biscuits, cherry-scented butter-smeared fists or floured moons  to ms cloritha, professional crier for dilroy’s funeral parlor (stuffed the dead fulla who knows, once saw some geezer’s toupee slid back like a yarmulke, a woman’s wig bangs in her ear, mourners too busy kiki-ing in the back to tell the woman’s kin her fall fell forward &amp; dipped to the side cloritha wailing all the while, earning her fifty bucks off the books)  to ms sheronda who daily bugged mama for dried black-eyed peas, swore her son looked like a jackson (the eldest sissy, what’s her face, bee bee, cee cee you know, “centipede”)  to the hungry black power thief who snatched nefertiti off our wall, public enemy off the turntable, platter of mustard glazed tongue picked clean in the kitchen sink  to cuban ruben cross the hall who loved tongue &amp; chuck d, father figure by george michael (also gone from the crates), who od’d at the tunnel (stuntin’) in mama’s leopard print dress  
NEW POEM
 lie still now while i prepare for my future, certain hard days ahead, when i’ll need what i know so clearly this moment.  i am making use of the one thing i learned of all the things my father tried to teach me: the art of memory.  i am letting this room and everything in it stand for my ideas about love and its difficulties.  i’ll let your love-cries, those spacious notes of a moment ago, stand for distance.  your scent, that scent of spice and a wound, i’ll let stand for mystery.  your sunken belly is the daily cup of milk i drank as a boy before morning prayer. the sun on the face of the wall is god, the face i can’t see, my soul,  and so on, each thing standing for a separate idea, and those ideas forming the constellation of my greater idea. and one day, when i need to tell myself something intelligent about love,  i’ll close my eyes and recall this room and everything in it: my body is estrangement. this desire, perfection. your closed eyes my extinction. now i’ve forgotten my idea. the book on the windowsill, riffled by wind . . . the even-numbered pages are the past, the odd- numbered pages, the future. the sun is god, your body is milk . . .  useless, useless . . . your cries are song, my body’s not me . . . no good . . . my idea has evaporated . . . your hair is time, your thighs are song . . . it had something to do with death . . . it had something to do with love.  
NEW POEM
 i slid the white louvers shut so i could stand in your closet a little while among the throng of flowered dresses you hadn’t worn in years, and touch the creases on each of their sleeves that smelled of forgiveness and even though you would still be alive a few more days i knew they were ready to let themselves be packed into liquor store boxes simply because you had asked that of them, and dropped at the door of the salvation army without having noticed me wrapping my arms around so many at once that one slipped a big padded shoulder off of its hanger as if to return the embrace.

NEW POEM
 crossed fingers gird the planet, though small optimism obtains.  will i read the serious doll in wraps, with its roller slur?  a book where everybody, reader and writer included, dies.  the kind of thing people said in the 1970s: “hello, i’m back being me again.”  my first and last names and the first and last names of both my parents have the same number of letters.  the wasp waist, the tennis dress, the shirtwaist, the dirndl (mainbocher).  a distant yet achingly distinct whinny:et voila! the walking buckboard.  dustin hoffman’s bookcase hanging by one hinge in air of eleventh street, dawn 1969.  telephone solicitation for a ballet school in need of “serious floors.”  the thought of someone flat on his back on the carpet, tossing and giggling.  if it hurts don’t do it. (there are several unless es to this caution.)  for the second time in two millennia slept through the meteor shower, results of last night’s talk.  
NEW POEM
 believe it or not, the old woman said, and i tried to picture it: a girl, the polished white ribs of a roast tied to her boots with twine, the twine coated with candle wax so she could glide uninterrupted across the ice— my mother, skating on bones.  
NEW POEM
 you give me the slip between garlic and lilies, as if this is what comes of my unprotected loves, of my hands in the sweet earth, their willful miscegenation of the border bed where you’re tucked in deep with tulips, too, like just one more of their heart-freaks: a fluke diamondine flake, a thin vein gone gold. being mine, you’ll grow up a girdled tree, girt with a ringed-around root, nothing like the fruitful vine of good wives—one of which i’ll never be so, my not-love-knot, you may as well come up instead like a kiss: the one wind gives to rouse the japanese maple, october’s aerialist, its bright aureole in the last late sun a red mouth, opening.

NEW POEM
 i slumbered with your poems on my breast spread open as i dropped them half-read through like dove wings on a figure on a tomb to see, if in a dream they brought of you,  i might not have the chance i missed in life through some delay, and call you to your face first soldier, and then poet, and then both, who died a soldier-poet of your race.  i meant, you meant, that nothing should remain unsaid between us, brother, and this remained— and one thing more that was not then to say: the victory for what it lost and gained.  you went to meet the shell's embrace of fire on vimy ridge; and when you fell that day the war seemed over more for you than me, but now for me than you—the other way.  how over, though, for even me who knew the foe thrust back unsafe beyond the rhine, if i was not to speak of it to you and see you pleased once more with words of mine?

 leo bends over his desk gazing at a memorandum while stuart stands beside him with a smile, saying, "leo, the order for those desks came in today from youngstown needle and thread!" c. loth inc., there you are like balboa the conqueror of those who want to buy office furniture or bar fixtures in nineteen forty in cincinnati, ohio! secretaries pound out invoices on antique typewriters— dactyllographs and fingernail biters. i am sitting on a desk looking at my daddy who is proud of but feels unsure about some aspects of his little laddie. i will go on to explore deep and/or nonsensical themes while my father's on the dark hardwood floor hit by a couple of ohio sunbeams. kenny, he says, some day you'll work in the store. but i felt "never more" or "never ever" harvard was far away world war two was distant psychoanalysis was extremely expensive all of these saved me from you. c. loth you made my father happy i saw his face shining he laughed a lot, working in you he said to miss ritter his secretary "ritt, this is my boy, kenny!" "hello there kenny," she said my heart in an uproar i loved you but couldn't think of staying with you i can see the virtues now that could come from being in you a sense of balance compromise and acceptance— not isolated moments of brilliance like a girl without a shoe, but someone that you care for every day— need for customers and the economy don't go away. there were little pamphlets distributed in you about success in business each about eight to twelve pages long one whole series of them all ended with the words "p.s. he got the job" one a story about a boy who said, "i swept up the street, sir, before you got up." or "there were five hundred extra    catalogues so i took them to people in the city who have a dog"— p.s. he got the job. i didn't get the job i didn't think that i could do the job i thought i might go crazy in the job staying in you you whom i could love but not be part of the secretaries clicked their smith coronas closed at five p.m. and took the streetcars to kentucky then and i left too.  
NEW POEM
 and does the heart grow old? you know in the indiscriminate green of summer or in earliest snow a landscape is another scene,  inchoate and anonymous, and every rock and bush and drift as our affections alter us will alter with the season’s shift.  so love by love we come at last, as through the exclusions of a rhyme, or the exactions of a past, to the simplicity of time,  the antiquity of grace, where yet we live in terror and delight with love as quiet as regret and love like anger in the night.

NEW POEM
 i have arrived here after taking many steps over the kitchen floors of friends and through their lives.  the dun-colored hills have been good to me and the gold rivers.  i have loved chrysantheumums, and children: i have been grandmother to some.  in one pocket i have hidden chocolates from you and knives.  speaking my real thoughts to no one  in bars and at lecterns i have told the truth fairly often, but hardly ever to myself.  i have not cried out against the crimes of my country  but i have protected myself, i have watched from a safe corner the rape of mountains, the eagle’s reckless plunge.   ever since high school i have waved goodbye to history:  i have assisted you to grow in all ways that were convenient to me.  what is a block vote against steam shovels?  my current events teacher was a fine man but his moral precepts were a put-up job and i followed them.  well-dressed, in my new adidas at every gathering i investigated my psyche with friends  and they investigated theirs with me.   but whenever trouble came in the front door i ran out the back and fell into the pit of my bones.  escaped from those burning buildings, the past, what balance can any of us hope for?  i was comparing lipsticks the day nagasaki vanished.  the day solzhenitsyn disappeared into the gulag i was attending a cocktail party.  perhaps there are only ashes in my handbag.  a man at the corner of broadway and forty-second street tried to sweep me into a trash barrel and i almost agreed.  already the dried blood was sifting along my wrists.  already my own hands were tightening around my throat   but sorrow saved me, sorrow gave me an image of bombs like human tears watering the world’s gardens.  how could i not answer?  since then i have been planting words in every windowbox, poking them to grow up.  what’s god, that he should be mindful of me?  sometimes i feel like wood waiting for someone to peel me.   indeed i have been lukewarm at heart, which is all that matters.  of tiny bread-colored atoms, equal fragments equally dispersed  that love each other and are never hungry.   what have i ever ignited that warmed anyone?  i have not followed the rivers.  dangerous as a pine needle packed in among others, in the dense multitudes  and dry timbers of the west  i am afraid of greed, the rich taste of it, the anger  hidden in my pockets.   columns of smoke on the horizon, pillars of green fire.  but i have arrived here somehow, neither have i stopped talking.  numberless are the kitchens i have sat in, chewing my fingers, trying to say something,  anything, so that the daughters of men should see as many sides of themselves as possible.   word after word my footprints have stumbled across deserts.  how should i escape them? they keep following after me.  a little wind stirs itself, whisks across my eyelids,  and i know what it is before i say it:  what if the world really articulates itself in the socket of a human knee?   god save me from the swamps of hubris but it may be, it may be.  before the idea, the impulse.  i feel it moving in me, it is there arthritic but still powerful, a seizure  delicate as grasshoppers, a light gathering in the skull.  between thumb and forefinger and the ballbearing joints of the tongue  in soft, glottal convulsions out of no alien skies  but out of the mind’s muscle the hieroglyph figures rise.   the little histories of words cannot be eaten.  i know it, you know it and the children...  but the images we make are our own.  in the cool caves of the intellect the twisted roots of them lead us  backwards and then forwards.   if only we could understand what’s in our pockets is for everyone!  i have a dictionary in one hand, a mirror.  strangers look at themselves in it, tracing the expressions they use  from one family to the next they comfort themselves, murmuring  the tongues we speak are a blizzard of words like warm wool flying:  in the shy conjugal rites of verb, consonant, vowel,  in the dark mucosal flesh lining the prismed underside of the skin  each one is a spark sheared from the veined fleece of the spirit  of the looking-glass body we live in.  it is the one i have been cherishing, the one all of us speak from,  for the world as we know it moves necessarily by steps.  breath, pulse beat, ten digital stops.  at the foot of the mountains i look up. does god lift up his hand to cover them?  blinded by tears like rain my bones turn granite, the spine of the hills congeals them.   where is the eye of the storm, or where is the center of my seeing?  the wind of my breath is a hurricane: i am locked inside myself.  painfully, up the bald stepladder i climb,  but sometimes the light in my head goes on more like the sun than a match.  just as they said in arabia  there’s a huge pantalooned angel swelling inside the body’s glass jar.  the white-haired thread of steam from the teakettle on the range whistles  and sharpens itself into a voice  bodiless as history, invisible but still whispering in ears  that keep trying to hear it.  it is as if midgets were bellowing their names down sets of cardboard cylinders.  but we have not disappeared yet.  my friends, we have said many things to each other  in new combinations, seed upon seed exploding and blossoming in kitchen gardens.  i confess i am ashamed of myself:  i have not tried hard enough to understand or listen to you speak.   but the word is mindful of itself and always has been.  littering every street  in the sly eyes of tin cans, drops of water in the gutter  the world looks back at us   from every known language: yoruba, hebrew, chinese,  arrogant english, the subject subjecting all to its desires,  even the softer tongues, romantic  self-reflexive, done to as we would be done by,  whatever life we cultivate out of the animal moans of childhood  it is all wheat fields, all grass growing and being grown.  with poisoned bread in my pockets, or gumdrops, or armies like myrmidons rising  what i say is true for a time only, thank god,  if i have only arrived anywhere it is to look carefully, at all i thought i knew.   in living rivers of speech the reflections i make are my own  and yet not:  though the old growth rings are hidden from us and the echoing tomorrows of the acorn,  the warm currents of the senses are a two-way street, my friends:  the palms of our hands are crisscrossed with as many intersections as a leaf.  
NEW POEM
 she was in love with the same danger everybody is. dangerous as it is to love a stranger, she was in love. with that same danger an adulteress risks a husband’s anger. stealthily death enters a house: she was in love with that danger. everybody is dangerous.

 and now, the horse is entering the sea, and the sea  holds it.  where are we?  behind us, the beach, yes, its  scrim, yes, of grass, dune, sky—desire  goes by, and though it’s wind of course making the grass bend,  unbend, we say it’s desire again, passing us by, souveniring us with gospel the grass, turned choir, leans into,  coming— lord, soon.  
NEW POEM
 i make a knife of words. i sit here waiting. i play with crumbs.  her eyes that should look straight at me are toward the window, glazed— husband’s horizon?  not armored. only armed with pots and pans. not out of arm’s reach, beyond curtains of doorbells, garden gates.  she puts up ironwork in her eyes; it draws a bolt over what’s real— then looks at me.  i wish i’d brought my saw.

 humps of shell emerge from dark water. believers toss hunks of bread, hoping the fat reptilian heads will loom forth from the murk and eat. meaning:you have been heard.  
NEW POEM
 what a fuckup you are. what dumbshit you do. your father's voice still whispers in you,  despite the joys that sweeten each day. your genius it isn't until, dying away,  it worms back through the sparkling dream where you drown him in an inch-deep stream:  your knee in his back, your strength on his skull, it begins singing praise for your skill.  
NEW POEM
 when i feel the old hunger coming on, i think of my two great-aunts, a farmer’s daughters, speaking into the dusk in north dakota. i imagine the dark baron riding out of their mouths, thick-skinned and girded against disaster, swathed in cuirass and chainmail and a curse. my hunger was theirs too long ago. it swims in my blood, groping for a foothold. it is the dark i thrust my tongue against, the wine and the delicate symphony that makes my head tick so exquisitely tonight. my ladies, my dusky girls, i see you with your bustles puffed up like life preservers, your needlepoint rose garden, your george eliot coiffures, your flounces gathered like an 1890s valentine. you both took heroin. your father never noticed. you sprinkled it in your oatmeal, embroidered doilies with it, ate it like a last supper at midnight. i know what you meant. there was always the hunger, the death of small things somewhere in your body, the children that would never take place in either of you. you were a garden of lost letters. a lust inhabited your veins. my addicts, the village spoke of you. under your parasols, two rose windows, the world swam with color. riding the monotonous hills at daybreak, you escaped the indecisions your blood has handed down to me. you rode your father’s spotted horses as if they might have ferried you over an edge, a dark mouth in the distance. i see you ride the black hills of my mind, sidesaddle, gowned in lemon silk, galloping in your laced-up flesh, completely unaware of something i inherited, the doubt, the fear, the needle point of speech, the hunger you passed down that i possess.  
NEW POEM
 two old crows sat on a fence rail. two old crows sat on a fence rail, thinking of effect and cause, of weeds and flowers, and nature's laws. one of them muttered, one of them stuttered, one of them stuttered, one of them muttered. each of them thought far more than he uttered. one crow asked the other crow a riddle. one crow asked the other crow a riddle: the muttering crow asked the stuttering crow, “why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle? why does a bee have a sword to his fiddle?” “bee-cause,” said the other crow, “bee-cause, b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b-cause.”  just then a bee flew close to their rail:— “buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz.” and those two black crows turned pale, and away those crows did sail. why? b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b-cause. b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b-cause. “buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzz             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzz.”

 i came to encounter a coyote i left all sorts of things behind you couldn’t get on a plane unless you traveled light back then there were weight restrictions for planes, they don’t have them any longer, american bodies have no restrictions, they’ve become so big that there aren’t restrictions on the weight of bodies or luggage any more, but back then, i can’t even count how many times i picked up my bags and stepped on the scale, no matter how many times i weighed myself, i still wasn’t the least bit lighter not knowing what else to do, i took out my books then i took out my clothes then i went to the bathroom and defecated then i took out more clothes then i threw up then i took out more books then i stripped off all my clothes, held my bag, and stood on the scale, but i wasn’t the least bit lighter know what i mean? that’s what it means to go on a trip that’s what it means to leave the place where you live trips and then more trips there are things you need to carry with you to survive not knowing what else to do, i called my husband, filed for divorce, talked to my children and told them mommy wouldn’t be home for a while, in other words, it was only after i abandoned my relationships, my attachments, and even my language that i was light enough to get on the plane, when i arrived, all i had was a few changes of clothes, some cash, my passport, my visa waiver, my credit cards, and an  international driver’s license in california, the sky was blue, there was nothing but seashore, wild land, and housing developments, it was hazy and hard to see in the evenings, it was as if everything was immersed in mother’s milk, my toes got cold, i bought some socks, but after wearing them three days, the cheap things were ready to fall apart, i looked long and hard at them, feeling like a coyote (yeah, i tell people i came alone but that is not entirely true i was always thinking about the coyote the two of us traveling together) i saw dead raccoons i saw dead skunks i smelled them too someone i met the first day said to me the whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhere it was an unfamiliar scent, but now i know it well the whole place smells like skunk, must be a dead one somewhere i know to say that to people now in any case, i didn’t see any coyotes (two traveling together) someone in the street told me to get the hell out of here why had i come? i couldn’t find what i wanted, i had come so far but,get the hell out, this isn’t the place where the coyotes are, they’re farther away, in deeper places, where there is nothing, where there is much more emptiness so i headed east from the western edge of the continent to the east the interstates with odd numbers run north and south while even numbers run east and west those in the 500s are the bypasses for i-5 (north-south) those in the 800s are the bypasses for i-8 (east-west) i took i-5 south to i-580 i went further south to i-8 then went east east, east, east and even further east in arizona, i took i-17 at flagstaff, i took us route 89 i dashed into a roadside motel, slept, and woke and started driving again the morning light shone brilliantly each time i stopped to fill up with gas, i bought some brownies, each individually wrapped, i tore off the wrappers with one hand and ate them as i drove, the ridiculously sweet lumps stuck to the roof  of my mouth, when i stopped in front of a motel that night, my fingers didn’t want to leave the steering wheel, at the registration desk, the words i needed to say in english didn’t rise to my lips, even though  i knew them all too well (two traveling together) there was a woman standing at the side of the road, i called out to her in broken english, asking her what was the matter, she answered in what was also broken english would you mind taking me to the nearest gas station? she sat in the passenger’s seat i’m navajo where are you from? from california, i answered no, that’s not what i meant what tribe are you from? she asked (two traveling together) from kayenta i took us route 163 toward monument valley i had heard that coyotes lived there long ago that it’s an amazing place, the moon rises, the sun sets i imagined it would be like seeing the ocean but when i got there, it wasn’t like the ocean at all rocks soared into the air rocks, rocks, even more rocks red rocks in the dust i watched the sun set over them by the time i got back to route 163, the sun had sunk deep beyond the horizon, the only thing i could see was the road in front of me,  i drove on looking for a place to sleep, but i didn’t see a thing, there wasn’t anything to see, air rushed through my cracked window,  letting out a long, thin, high-pitched whistle hii-iuu-uuuuu hii-iuu-uuuuu like a reed flute my thin, hard window was slightly open, the wind rushed in but couldn’t escape hii-iuuu uuu-uuuuu uuu-hiiuuuuu (two of us heard it) i drove a long way before spying a large motel, i saw the vacancy sign as i approached, i thought i’d have to drive for hours and hours before finding a place to sleep, i thought i wouldn’t stop, that i’d drive all night without stopping, but the place i found was part of a chain you see in every city, the bed was big and deep, and there was lots of hot water in the tub (two of us were there) the next morning the car was completely filthy the whole thing was covered with bright red dirt and sand the windshield was covered with the splattered bodies of countless insects no one knew i had slept there, nor that i was leaving, nor which direction i was headed, no one knew it was a day that invited death along the roadside i hadn’t even driven for five minutes before i saw it — a single, dead coyote lying on its back, legs in the air (it was both me and my travel companion, too) translated from the  japanese

 unstable dream, according to the place, be steadfast once, or else at least be true. by tasted sweetness make me not to rue the sudden loss of thy false feignèd grace. by good respect in such a dangerous case thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew but madest my sprite live, my care to renew, my body in tempest her succour to embrace. the body dead, the sprite had his desire, painless was th'one, th'other in delight. why then, alas, did it not keep it right, returning, to leap into the fire? and where it was at wish, it could not remain, such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.

 lady, lovely lady, careless and gay! once when a beggar called she gave her child away.  the beggar took the baby, wrapped it in a shawl, “bring her back,” the lady said, “next time you call.”  hard by lived a vain man, so vain and so proud, he walked on stilts to be seen by the crowd.  up above the chimney pots, tall as a mast, and all the people ran about shouting till he passed.  “a splendid match surely,” neighbours saw it plain, “although she is so careless, although he is so vain.”  but the lady played bobcherry, did not see or care, as the vain man went by her aloft in the air.  this gentle-born couple lived and died apart. water will not mix with oil, nor vain with careless heart.  
NEW POEM
 the fleet astronomer can bore and thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind: he views their stations, walks from door to door, surveys, as if he had designed to make a purchase there; he sees their dances, and knoweth long before both their full-eyes aspècts, and secret glances.  the nimble diver with his side cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch his dearly-earnèd pearl, which god did hide on purpose from the venturous wretch; that he might save his life, and also hers who with excessive pride her own destruction and his danger wears.  the subtle chymic can divest and strip the creature naked, till he find the callow principles within their nest: there he imparts to them his mind, admitted to their bed-chamber, before they appear trim and dressed to ordinary suitors at the door.  what hath not man sought out and found, but his dear god? who yet his glorious law embosoms in us, mellowing the ground with showers and frosts, with love and awe, so that we need not say, “where’s this command?” poor man, thou searchest round to find out death, but missest life at hand.  
NEW POEM
 there are fat wet vines creeping into my house through the pipes and through   the walls gentle as blue flames they curl into  my living there is ice in my attic sugar on my tile i am present and useless like a nose torn   from a face and set in a bowl when  i saw god i used the wrong pronouns   god bricked up my mouthhole  his fists were white as gold there were  roaches in my beard now i live like a widow   every day a heave of knitting patterns and sex toys my family speaks of me   with such pride noonesh to roghane they say  his bread is in oil i thank them for that and for their chromosomes most of which   have been lovely i am lovely too my body  is hard and choked with juice like a plastic   throat stuffed with real grapes my turn-ons  include ovid and fake leather my turn-  offs have all been ushered into the base-   ment i’ll drink to them and to any victory the vines are all growing toward the foot   of my bed i am waiting for them to come  under the covers i am the only person still in this house there is no one here to look away  
NEW POEM
 no, no! go from me. i have left her lately. i will not spoil my sheath with lesser brightness, for my surrounding air hath a new lightness; slight are her arms, yet they have bound me straitly and left me cloaked as with a gauze of æther; as with sweet leaves; as with subtle clearness. oh, i have picked up magic in her nearness to sheathe me half in half the things that sheathe her. no, no! go from me. i have still the flavour, soft as spring wind that’s come from birchen bowers. green come the shoots, aye april in the branches, as winter’s wound with her sleight hand she staunches, hath of the trees a likeness of the savour: as white their bark, so white this lady’s hours.  
NEW POEM
 one must be brave to live through a day. what remains is nothing but the pleasure of longing—very precious.  longing purifies as does flying, strengthens as does an effort, it fashions the soul as work fashions the belly.  it is like an athlete, like a runner who will never stop running. and this gives him endurance.  longing is nourishing for the strong. it is like a window on a high tower, through which blows the wind of strength.  longing, virginity of happiness.  
NEW POEM
 long ago we quit lifting our heels like the others—horse, dog, and tiger— though we thrill to their speed as they flee. even the mouse bearing the great weight of a nugget of dog food is enviably graceful. there is little spring to our walk, we are so burdened with responsibility, all of the disciplinary actions that have fallen to us, the punishments, the killings, and all with our feet bound stiff in the skins of the conquered. but sometimes, in the early hours, we can feel what it must have been like to be one of them, up on our toes, stealing past doors where others are sleeping, and suddenly able to see in the dark.  
NEW POEM
 she wants a house full of cups and the ghosts of last century’s lesbians; i want a spotless apartment, a fast computer.  she wants a woodstove, three cords of ash, an axe; i want a clean gas flame.  she wants a row of jars: oats, coriander, thick green oil; i want nothing to store.  she wants pomanders, linens, baby quilts, scrapbooks.  she wants wellesley reunions.  i want gleaming floorboards, the river’s reflection.  she wants shrimp and sweat and salt; she wants chocolate.  i want a raku bowl, steam rising from rice.  she wants goats, chickens, children.  feeding and weeping.  i want wind from the river freshening cleared rooms. she wants birthdays, theaters, flags, peonies. i want words like lasers.  she wants a mother’s tenderness.  touch ancient as the river. i want a woman’s wit swift as a fox. she’s in her city, meeting her deadline; i’m in my mill village out late with the dog, listening to the pinging wind bells, thinking of the twelve years of wanting, apart and together. we’ve kissed all weekend; we want to drive the hundred miles and try it again.  
NEW POEM
 two musics washing over me, and morning asks, which loneliness comes closest to the inky chromatics inside you?  
NEW POEM
 everything that was young went quickly, the way his eyes met mine as soon as we  woke together in a room outside nanjing, feeling as if all the things that were falling  would fall and make their thunder, leave us with the challenge of being happy,  all the things that felt given when gifts were not just surprises, but what we  knew, what we hoped to take with us to heaven, unbound by faults and sins,  not deceived the way we were when the end came to what we knew of china,  landing me here. i am a wish in the skies spun out from celestial space to be poor,  to be covered with black skin, a felt quilt of a map with only one way to china —  through pain as big as hogs squealing at killing time on black farms in alabama —  the noise of death, the shrill needle that turns clouds over to rip the air  above the cities where people are young and all that is given is never taken away.  
NEW POEM
 the mornings are his, blue and white like the tablecloth at breakfast. he’s happy in the house, a sweep of the spoon brings the birds under his chair. he sings and the dishes disappear.  or holding a crayon like a candle, he draws a circle. it is his hundredth dragonfly. calling for more paper, this one is red-winged and like the others, he wills it to fly, simply by the unformed curve of his signature.  waterwings he calls them, the floats i strap to his arms. i wear an apron of concern, sweep the morning of birds. to the water he returns, plunging where it’s cold, moving and squealing into sunlight. the water from here seems flecked with gold.  i watch the circles his small body makes fan and ripple, disperse like an echo into the sum of water, light and air. his imprint on the water has but a brief lifespan, the flicker of a dragonfly’s delicate wing.  this is sadness, i tell myself, the morning he chooses to leave his wings behind, because he will not remember that he and beauty were aligned, skimming across the water, nearly airborne, on his first solo flight. i’ll write “how he could not contain his delight.” at the other end, in another time frame, he waits for me— having already outdistanced this body, the one that slipped from me like a fish, floating, free of itself.  
NEW POEM
 todd’s hardware was dust and a monkey— a real one, on the second floor— and mrs. todd there behind the glass cases. we stepped over buckets of nails and lawnmowers to get to the candy counter in the back, and pointed at the red wax lips, and mary janes, and straws full of purple sugar. said goodbye to mrs. todd, she white-faced and silent, and walked the streets of beaver, our teeth sunk hard in the wax, and big red lips worth kissing.

NEW POEM
 that time my grandmother dragged me through the perfume aisles at saks, she held me up by my arm, hissing, “stand up,” through clenched teeth, her eyes bright as a dog’s cornered in the light. she said it over and over, as if she were jesus, and i were dead. she had been solid as a tree, a fur around her neck, a light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling marble and passed through brass openings—in 1945. there was not even a black elevator operator at saks. the saleswoman had brought velvet leggings to lace me in, and cooed, as if in the service of all grandmothers. my grandmother had smiled, but not hungrily, not like my mother who hated them, but wanted to please, and they had smiled back, as if they were wearing wooden collars. when my legs gave out, my grandmother dragged me up and held me like god holds saints by the roots of the hair. i begged her to believe i couldn’t help it. stumbling, her face white with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing away from those eyes that saw through her clothes, under her skin, all the way down to the transparent genes confessing.  
NEW POEM
 often the slightest gesture is most telling, as when he reaches tenderly in passing to pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall  of her hair, or even the absence of all gesture: the way she doesn’t need to turn to know who, in this gathering of friends, has touched her.  it was as if he dreamed some private garden. perhaps he woke from it, mid-reach, to find his hand too near her hair in this crowded yard,  and maybe even now she’s shuttering in (she’s even better than you or i at that) a storm of worry and recrimination—  did anyone notice? how could he do that here!— by seamlessly continuing to tell you about her trip to see her favorite vermeer  this morning in the delft show at the met: “so now they say she isn’t weighing pearls or gold or anything—it’s just the light  gleaming off empty scales.” so much is hard to know for sure. if i confronted her, she’d say it was just a leaf—who could afford  to disagree? could we? now she’s explaining how the girl faces a mirror we can’t see into and how behind her hangs a gloomy painting  of the last judgment: “over her head god floats in a cloud,” she says, “like a thought balloon.” but you don’t hear. you’re watching me. i nod.  
NEW POEM
 what i would like to give them for a change is not the usual prescription with its hubris of the power to restore, to cure; what i would like to give them, ill from not enough of laying in the sun not caring what the onlookers might think while feeding some banana to their dogs— what i would like to offer them is this, not reassurance that their lungs sound fine, or that the mole they’ve noticed change is not a melanoma, but instead of fear transfigured by some doctorly advice i’d like to give them my astonishment at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping, and how ridiculously gently it slicked down my hair; i’d like to give them that, the joy i felt while staring in your eyes as you learned epidemiology (the science of disease in populations), the night around our bed like timelessness, like comfort, like what i would give to them.  
NEW POEM
 what should i say, since faith is dead, and truth away from you is fled? should i be led with doubleness? nay, nay, mistress!  i promised you, and you promised me, to be as true as i would be. but since i see your double heart, farewell my part!  though for to take it is not my mind, but to forsake [one so unkind] and as i find, so will i trust: farewell, unjust!  can ye say nay? but you said that i alway should be obeyed? and thus betrayed or that i wiste— farewell, unkissed.  
NEW POEM
 when i was fair and young, then favor graced me. of many was i sought their mistress for to be. but i did scorn them all and answered them therefore: go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.  how many weeping eyes i made to pine in woe, how many sighing hearts i have not skill to show, but i the prouder grew and still this spake therefore: go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.  then spake fair venus’ son, that proud victorious boy, saying: you dainty dame, for that you be so coy, i will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more: go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.  as soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast that neither night nor day i could take any rest. wherefore i did repent that i had said before: go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.  
NEW POEM
 the boy painted himself white and ran into the darkness.  we let the words “he may be dead, bury him,” bury him.  we took his clothes to the rummage sale in the basement of the mission we put his photographs and drawings in a birdcage and covered it with a starquilt.  for four nights voices carried clear to the river.  after winter so many storms moved in strangers came among us they danced they shoveled in the shadows of trees  then, somehow we all felt all of us were of this one boy.  
NEW POEM
 he’s as high as a georgia pine, my father’d say, half laughing. southern trees as measure, metaphor. highways lined with kudzu-covered southern trees.  fuchsia, lavender, white, light pink, purple : crape myrtle bouquets burst open on sturdy branches of skin-smooth bark : my favorite southern trees.  one hundred degrees in the shade: we settle into still pools of humidity, moss- dark, beneath live oaks. southern heat makes us grateful for southern trees.  the maples in our front yard flew in spring on helicopter wings. in fall, we splashed in colored leaves, but never sought sap from these southern trees.  frankly, my dear, that’s a magnolia, i tell her, fingering the deep green, nearly plastic leaves, amazed how little a northern girl knows about southern trees.  i’ve never forgotten the charred bitter fruit of holiday’s poplars, nor will i : it’s part of what makes me evie :  i grew up in the shadow of southern trees.  
NEW POEM
 sometimes the rain shines just when the sun reigns, and that was the way it is beyond those french doors that late afternoon here in this mind’s early evening where they still fade in that cool color polaroid, pastel shades of her prom dress, a bowl of double peonies, promising, precocious, trying, trying to open.  •  their friend and he were tight tight-rope walkers, self-taught taut-trope-talkers, stalking jamb-up, arm-in-arm and caroling to lucky stars their bars and rebars, the night a carousel of tryst and troth, of casual carousals, cocky arousals, pitching the dark to the dark. (streetlight and moth, reader, she married both.)  •  but then there he was, in the morning’s mourning, soi-disant proustian mignon, aesthetic ascetic and kansas rube reducing his thought to a bouillon cube that no one hot ought ever pore over.  
NEW POEM
 at fifty-six, having left my mother, my father buys a motorcycle. i imagine him because it is the son’s sorrowful assignment to imagine his father: there, hunched on his mount, with black boots, with bad teeth, between shifts at the mill, ripping furrows in the backroads, past barn and field and silo, past creek and rock, past the brown mare, sleek in her impertinence, never slowing until he sees the bull.   he stops, pulls his bike to the side of the road, where golden rod and clover grow, walks up to the fence, admires its horns, its wet snout snorting and blowing its breath, its girth, its trampling of small wild flowers.  
NEW POEM
 small red tin box sealed in shrink-wrap, cut open with pocketknife, pried apart, its goods aerate the office. i pluck white sliced chalky cylinders; let them simmer in my mouth. i exhale peppermint scent through my nose. cut open the official letter. a map in letters on a white page. my teeth grind mints. photocopies slightly off alignment, i blur lines. equations disperse family through land documents, position each generation. i am only fourth in line. some plots are gumbo after winter thaw. sections stitched together with extended relatives. this ritual, personal death papers drafted. i am partial to this grassland; the place of deer marks and porcupine quills, ledger extrapolates history. i refold estate document, place it back into its envelope.  
NEW POEM
 i ask not wit, nor beauty do i crave, nor wealth, nor pompous titles wish to have; but since, 'tis doomed through all degrees of life, whether a daughter, sister, or a wife; that females should the stronger males obey, and yield implicit to their lordly sway; since this, i say, is ev'ry woman's fate, give me a mind to suit my slavish state.

NEW POEM
 i.  maggots in the food, maggots in the floorboards, maggots in the recurring nightmare in which, lying down with a rugged adonis, i wake to find him almost nibbled away. certainly signs of death are everywhere, but love is more than combat with worms and cannot be so glibly explained away; i do not tremble or knock my knees to keep the maggots slumbering below ground, or crush them underfoot by flocking to everything they are not: raucous gatherings, stolen kisses. on the contrary, i come away from parties adoring what is wormlike in them: the unrisen soufflé, the precocious boy’s octogenarian sayings, the drooping lids of the hostess, someone’s death rattle of a laugh. certainly love has commerce with vermin, but it is a friendly partnership, not a league of discord; a hacking cough gives proof of a full life, a passing stranger seems all the stronger when one foot is sinking quietly into the grave.   ii.  but is is this lingering horror of dust that makes me pull us out of the cold earth any way i know how: because i strive for heaven in little rooms, visit you in order to suck your blood, then spread it over pipes and daffodils, and shove you up to the vacant sky, where you hover like a stone-cold, tedious statue who never dies, you, poor pawn, are a jack-in-the-box gone haywire, and i am a grinning humanist with bad dreams.  
NEW POEM
 the gallant youth, who may have gained, or seeks, a "winsome marrow," was but an infant in the lap when first i looked on yarrow; once more, by newark's castle-gate long left without a warder, i stood, looked, listened, and with thee, great minstrel of the border!  grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day, their dignity installing in gentle bosoms, while sere leaves were on the bough, or falling; but breezes played, and sunshine gleamed- the forest to embolden; reddened the fiery hues, and shot transparence through the golden.  for busy thoughts the stream flowed on in foamy agitation; and slept in many a crystal pool for quiet contemplation: no public and no private care the freeborn mind enthralling, we made a day of happy hours, our happy days recalling.  brisk youth appeared, the morn of youth, with freaks of graceful folly,- life's temperate noon, her sober eve, her night not melancholy; past, present, future, all appeared in harmony united, like guests that meet, and some from far, by cordial love invited.  and if, as yarrow, through the woods and down the meadow ranging, did meet us with unaltered face, though we were changed and changing; if, then, some natural shadows spread our inward prospect over, the soul's deep valley was not slow its brightness to recover.  eternal blessings on the muse, and her divine employment! the blameless muse, who trains her sons for hope and calm enjoyment; albeit sickness, lingering yet, has o'er their pillow brooded; and care waylays their steps-a sprite not easily eluded.  for thee, o scott! compelled to change green eildon-hill and cheviot for warm vesuvio's vine-clad slopes; and leave thy tweed and tiviot for mild sorrento's breezy waves; may classic fancy, linking with native fancy her fresh aid, preserve thy heart from sinking!  oh! while they minister to thee, each vying with the other, may health return to mellow age with strength, her venturous brother; and tiber, and each brook and rill renowned in song and story, with unimagined beauty shine, nor lose one ray of glory!  for thou, upon a hundred streams, by tales of love and sorrow, of faithful love, undaunted truth hast shed the power of yarrow; and streams unknown, hills yet unseen, wherever they invite thee, at parent nature's grateful call, with gladness must requite thee.  a gracious welcome shall be thine, such looks of love and honour as thy own yarrow gave to me when first i gazed upon her; beheld what i had feared to see, unwilling to surrender dreams treasured up from early days, the holy and the tender.  and what, for this frail world, were all that mortals do or suffer, did no responsive harp, no pen, memorial tribute offer? yea, what were mighty nature's self? her features, could they win us, unhelped by the poetic voice that hourly speaks within us?  nor deem that localized romance plays false with our affections; unsanctifies our tears-made sport for fanciful dejections: ah, no! the visions of the past sustain the heart in feeling life as she is-our changeful life, with friends and kindred dealing.  bear witness, ye, whose thoughts that day in yarrow's groves were centred; who through the silent portal arch of mouldering newark entered; and clomb the winding stair that once too timidly was mounted by the "last minstrel,"(not the last!) ere he his tale recounted.  flow on for ever, yarrow stream! fulfil thy pensive duty, well pleased that future bards should chant for simple hearts thy beauty; to dream-light dear while yet unseen, dear to the common sunshine, and dearer still, as now i feel, to memory's shadowy moonshine!  
NEW POEM
 i’ve expanded like the swollen door in summer to fit my own dimension. your loneliness  is a letter i read and put away, a daily reminder in the cry of the magpie that i am  still capable of inflicting pain at this distance.  like a painting, our talk is dense with description, half-truths, landscapes, phrases layered  with a patina over time. when she came into my life i didn’t hesitate.  or is that only how it seems now, looking back? or is that only how you accuse me, looking back?  long ago, this desert was an inland sea. in the mountains you can still find shells.  it’s these strange divagations i’ve come to love: midday sun on pink escarpments; dusk on gray sandstone;  toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot climb to acoma pueblo, where the spirit  of the dead hovers about its earthly home four days, before the prayer sticks drive it away.  today all good jews collect their crimes like old clothes to be washed and given to the poor.  i remember how my father held his father around the shoulders as they walked to the old synagogue in philadelphia.  "we're almost there, pop," he said. "a few more blocks." i want to tell you that we, too, are almost there,  for someone has mapped this autumn field with meaning, and any day october brooding in me, will open to reveal  our names—inscribed or absent — among the dry thistles and spent weeds.  
NEW POEM
 i want to spend a lot but not all of my years with you. we’ll talk about kids but make plans to travel. i will remember your eyes as green when they were gray. our dogs will be named for now and mostly. sex will be good but next door’s will sound better.  there will be small things. i will pick up your damp towel from the bed, and then i won’t. i won’t be as hot as i was when i wasn’t yours and your hairline now so untrustworthy. when we pull up alongside a cattle car and hear the frightened lows, i will silently judge you for not immediately renouncing meat. you will bring me wine and notice how much i drink.  the garden you plant and i plant is tunneled through by voles, the vowels we speak aren’t vows, but there’s something holding me here, for now, like your eyes, which i suppose are brown, after all.  
NEW POEM
 clownlike, happiest on your hands, feet to the stars, and moon-skulled, gilled like a fish. a common-sense thumbs-down on the dodo’s mode. wrapped up in yourself like a spool, trawling your dark as owls do. mute as a turnip from the fourth of july to all fools’ day, o high-riser, my little loaf.  vague as fog and looked for like mail. farther off than australia. bent-backed atlas, our traveled prawn. snug as a bud and at home like a sprat in a pickle jug. a creel of eels, all ripples. jumpy as a mexican bean. right, like a well-done sum. a clean slate, with your own face on.  
NEW POEM
 it's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers. there is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote, like the memory of scales descending the white keys of a childhood piano—outside the window, palms! and the heavy head of the cereus, inclining, soon to let down its white or yellow-white.  now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap, like the memory of a white dress cast down . . . so much has fallen. and i, who have listened for a step all afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away, already in memory. and the terrible scales descending on the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers abounding.  
NEW POEM
 some students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack. he had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum. and as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer. don’t make me too long, or i’ll look kind of goofy, sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer.  suddenly something snaps. what happened? sighs the professor from the rack. we were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped; you may have heard it ... yes, i was there. don’t you remember? sighs the professor. and then we heard an academic sigh ... yes, i heard it, too, sighs the professor, it seemed to come from the rack where i was being stretched beyond my wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum ...

 i once carried my mollusk tune all the way to the lottery of gods.  rain was the old funeral choir that keened of a hemisphere  moored under lampwings. clouds never left. i knew  the lights would shine clearer if i closed my eyes, just as  i knew the pacific would teach me to sleep before tying my  name to the flaming. here i am now at the end of amethyst,  drizzling another lost sunrise inside the quilt of your hand.  
NEW POEM
 quick passage into memory and behind only blank spaces,  blue stain on pink litmus or merely known so closely  something falls away receding from touch, caught in the air  your fingers move, agile water-fly padding the surface  of what is seen even among these defractions, bent  pencil or warps of a flat eye, the wide world circling.  
NEW POEM
 is an imaginary flower that never fades. the amaranth is blue with black petals, it’s yellow with red petals, it’s enormous and grows into the shape of a girl’s house, the seeds nestle high in the closet where she hid a boy. the boy and his bike flee the girl’s parents from the tip of the leaves, green summer light behind the veins. the amaranth is an imaginary flower in the shape of a girl’s house dispensing gin and tonics from its thorns, a succulent. this makes the boy’s bike steer off-course all summer, following the girl in her marvelous car, the drunken bike.  he was a small part of summer, he was summer’s tongue.  
NEW POEM
 i.m. and then the sun came slicing sideways, clear water reflecting it, giving it slant. a gloss of rain so quick and light that day  hardly made a sound. the thought of sheets hung out and drying on the line, of seeds in soil and soil itself, the glutting ends  of stems of leaves that will them to let fall up and out and through the trees, the shape that shoots could take, of you  and this moment as it happens: our echoing hush as we try to hold the close music of the blackbird in the bush.   •   and then the sun continued on. lough neagh cooled under the firm keels of fishing boats on the water’s taut skin,  their painted hulls in pointed arcs an emblem of balance so finely wrought that they could tell the weight of light or air.  each night we walk along the shore, expecting still to find your sturdy figure waist-deep in waders, plumbing darkness,  hauling it in, but never again your grip on the reel and never again the deft music of the blackbird nesting in your hand.  
NEW POEM
 and then we cowards who loved the whispering evening, the houses, the paths by the river, the dirty red lights of those places, the sweet soundless sorrow— we reached our hands out toward the living chain in silence, but our heart startled us with blood, and no more sweetness then, no more losing ourselves on the path by the river— no longer slaves, we knew we were alone and alive.

 i placed a jar in tennessee, and round it was, upon a hill. it made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.  the wilderness rose up to it, and sprawled around, no longer wild. the jar was round upon the ground and tall and of a port in air.  it took dominion everywhere. the jar was gray and bare. it did not give of bird or bush, like nothing else in tennessee.

 angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze, are the details of a threaded diamond string and its fake catachrestic applause. like that of the angelheaded beast spreading its wings, as if to swim under the light of the glowworm and hyacinth, the fish are oratory and not. the pulchritude of bombazine on a shattering geoidal mid-afternoon, dribbling from sea rock to splint, the wing tips are hardly bleak accoutrements, their own swinging by the bay of a chest and a previous rock. here we are stranded, pelagic with clot, and the fish burble with oratory and i kind of like them a lot.

 heigho! the lark and the owl! one flies the morning, and one lulls the night: only the nightingale, poor fond soul, sings like the fool through darkness and light.  "a widow bird sate mourning for her love upon a wintry bough; the frozen wind crept on above, the freezing stream below.  "there was no leaf upon the forest bare, no flower upon the ground, and little motion in the air except the mill-wheel's sound."

 the mind’s black kettle hisses its wild exigencies at every turn: the hour before the coffee and the hour after.  penscratch of the gone morning, woman a pitched hysteria watching the mad-ant scramble, her small wants devouring.  her binge and skin-thrall. her old selves being shuffled off into labyrinths, this birdless sky a longing.  her moth-mouth rabble unfacing touch-and-go months under winter, torn letters under floorboards,  each fickle moon pecked through with doubt. and one spoiled onion. pale cyclops on her kitchen counter  now sprouting green missives, some act of contrition; neighbor-god’s vacuum a loud rule thrown down.  her mother now on the line saying too much. this island is not a martyr. you tinker too much with each gaunt memory, your youth  and its unweeding. not everything blooms here a private history — consider this immutable. consider our galloping sun, its life.  your starved homesickness. the paper wasp kingdom you set fire to, watched for days until it burnt a city in you. until a family your hands could not save  became the hurricane. how love is still unrooting you. and how to grow a new body — to let each word be the wild rain swallowed pure like an antidote.  her mother at the airport saying don’t come back. love your landlocked city. money. buy a coat. and even exile can be glamorous.  some nights she calls across the deaf ocean to no one in particular. no answer. her heart’s double-vault a muted hydra.  this hour a purge  of  its own unselfing. she must make a home of it.

 o hesper-phosphor, far away shining, the first, the last white star, hear’st thou the strange, the ghostly cry, that moan of an ancient agony from purple forest to golden sky shivering over the breathless bay? it is not the wind that wakes with the day; for see, the gulls that wheel and call, beyond the tumbling white-topped bar, catching the sun-dawn on their wings, like snow-flakes or like rose-leaves fall, flutter and fall in airy rings; and drift, like lilies ruffling into blossom upon a golden lake’s unwrinkled bosom.  are not the forest’s deep-lashed fringes wet with tears? is not the voice of all regret breaking out of the dark earth’s heart? she too, she too, has loved and lost; and we— we that remember our lost arcady, have we not known, we too, the primal greenwood’s arch of blue, the radiant clouds at sunrise curled around the brows of the golden world; the marble temples, washed with dew, to which with rosy limbs aflame the violet-eyed thalassian came, came pitiless, only to display how soon the youthful splendour dies away; came, only to depart laughing across the gray-grown bitter sea? for each man’s life is earth’s epitome, and though the years bring more than aught they take, yet might his heart and hers well break remembering how one prayer must still be vain, how one fair hope is dead, one passion quenched, one glory fled, with those first loves that never come again.  how many, how many generations, have heard that sigh in the dawn, when the dark earth yearns to the unforgotten nations and the old loves withdrawn, old loves, old lovers, wonderful and unnumbered as waves on the wine-dark sea, ’neath the tall white towers of troy and the temples that slumbered; in thessaly?  from the beautiful palaces, from the miraculous portals, the swift white feet are flown! they were taintless of dust, the proud, the peerless immortals as they sped to their loftier throne! perchance they are there, earth dreams, on the shores of hesper, her rosy-bosomed hours, listening the wild fresh forest’s enchanted whisper, crowned with its new strange flowers; listening the great new ocean’s triumphant thunder on the stainless unknown shore, while that perilous queen of the world’s delight and wonder comes white from the foam once more.  when the mists divide with the dawn o’er those glittering waters, do they gaze over unoared seas— naiad and nymph and the woodland’s rose-crowned daughters and the oceanides? do they sing together, perchance, in that diamond splendour, that world of dawn and dew, with eyelids twitching to tears and with eyes grown tender, the sweet old songs they knew, the songs of greece? ah, with harp-strings mute do they falter as the earth like a small star pales? when the heroes launch their ship by the smoking altar does a memory lure their sails? far, far away, do their hearts resume the story that never on earth was told, when all those urgent oars on the waste of glory cast up its gold?  are not the forest fringes wet with tears? is not the voice of all regret breaking out of the dark earth’s heart? she too, she too, has loved and lost; and though she turned last night in disdain away from the sunset-embers, from her soul she can never depart; she can never depart from her pain. vainly she strives to forget; beautiful in her woe, she awakes in the dawn and remembers.

 who can face the sea and not inherit its loneliness? — olin ivory i   gray sky, gray sea —gray mind, the man thinks. he thinks: to grow old with it and kicks a stone into the water.  he mucks at the seam and it crumbles below him.  a sea gull beaks a crab, flights vertically and drops it to the rocks. the man cracks with laughter,  tossing a stone to a stone.   ii   working alone means the voice must grow louder, for who can stand to think quietly all through the day’s calculations?  i cannot. i let the voice grow loud. i let the voice hum outside my body in distinguishable phrasings, and count  the increments as i set the fence according to the blade. all day  i stand before a blade and push things into its path.  i stand aside as what is removed is whisked alongside me. the smallest particles of   what is removed thicken the air,  making a dream inside which one cannot live. all day the voice is learning how to be outside of   the body.   iii   a man is not a beach, nor is he stone, though he collects their entirety in a single thought. he works alone and his thoughts begin to smack of stone. his teeth clatter with their collection.   iv   a man can hold a secret between his teeth, and it will never leave his mouth, for who would listen to his wavering tune of so sad and how hard and hear anything original? he is that he is — the errand and the fool  running to himself over and over only to find that even he is tired of telling about it. to grow old with it  was the task, and the question always: would he last?  a man can believe in the body and have no one,  as though he were ghost or stone, nothing to speak at or be heard from.   v   all work, no pay makes a body bray. though he may bray —  though he may bray and bray,  forgive him the bit. if he tells you his secret, he will have no secret. this is how one sings a sentence into stone.

 “son,” said my mother, when i was knee-high, “you’ve need of clothes to cover you, and not a rag have i.  “there’s nothing in the house to make a boy breeches, nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches.  “there’s nothing in the house but a loaf-end of rye, and a harp with a woman’s head nobody will buy,” and she began to cry.  that was in the early fall. when came the late fall, “son,” she said, “the sight of you makes your mother’s blood crawl,—  “little skinny shoulder-blades sticking through your clothes! and where you’ll get a jacket from god above knows.  “it’s lucky for me, lad, your daddy’s in the ground, and can’t see the way i let his son go around!” and she made a queer sound.  that was in the late fall. when the winter came, i’d not a pair of breeches nor a shirt to my name.  i couldn’t go to school, or out of doors to play. and all the other little boys passed our way.  “son,” said my mother, “come, climb into my lap, and i’ll chafe your little bones while you take a nap.”  and, oh, but we were silly for half an hour or more, me with my long legs dragging on the floor,  a-rock-rock-rocking to a mother-goose rhyme! oh, but we were happy for half an hour’s time!  but there was i, a great boy, and what would folks say to hear my mother singing me to sleep all day, in such a daft way?  men say the winter was bad that year; fuel was scarce, and food was dear.  a wind with a wolf’s head howled about our door, and we burned up the chairs and sat on the floor.  all that was left us was a chair we couldn’t break, and the harp with a woman’s head nobody would take, for song or pity’s sake.  the night before christmas i cried with the cold, i cried myself to sleep like a two-year-old.  and in the deep night i felt my mother rise, and stare down upon me with love in her eyes.  i saw my mother sitting on the one good chair, a light falling on her from i couldn’t tell where,  looking nineteen, and not a day older, and the harp with a woman’s head leaned against her shoulder.  her thin fingers, moving in the thin, tall strings, were weav-weav-weaving wonderful things.  many bright threads, from where i couldn’t see, were running through the harp-strings rapidly,  and gold threads whistling through my mother’s hand. i saw the web grow, and the pattern expand.  she wove a child’s jacket, and when it was done she laid it on the floor and wove another one.  she wove a red cloak so regal to see, “she’s made it for a king’s son,” i said, “and not for me.” but i knew it was for me.  she wove a pair of breeches quicker than that! she wove a pair of boots and a little cocked hat.  she wove a pair of mittens, she wove a little blouse, she wove all night in the still, cold house.  she sang as she worked, and the harp-strings spoke; her voice never faltered, and the thread never broke. and when i awoke,—  there sat my mother with the harp against her shoulder looking nineteen and not a day older,  a smile about her lips, and a light about her head, and her hands in the harp-strings frozen dead.  and piled up beside her and toppling to the skies, were the clothes of a king’s son, just my size.

 are heading south, pulled by a compass in the genes. they are not fooled by this odd november summer, though we stand in our doorways wearing cotton dresses. we are watching them  as they swoop and gather— the shadow of wings falls over the heart. when they rustle among the empty branches, the trees must think their lost leaves have come back.  the birds are heading south, instinct is the oldest story. they fly over their doubles, the mute weathervanes, teaching all of us with their tailfeathers the true north.

 bustle and caw. recall the green heat rising from the new minted earth, granite  and basalt, proto-continents shuffling and stacking the deck, first shadows flung  from the ultraviolet haze. a fern uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace  of replication warms the world, one becoming two, two four: exponential blossom.  lush with collision, the teacup balance of x and y, cells like balloons  escaping into the sky—then the dumbstruck hour, unmoored by a river,  a first fish creeps to the land to marvel at the monstrous buds of its toes. and stars  grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing, ordinary days, climbing the spine’s winding  stair, where crickets yawn and history spins.

 after ian sanborn’s asl poem of the same title a man with eyes as blank as the indifference of nature is staring straight ahead as the whole thing unfolds. he has a black beard, black shirt, black woolen cap — he could be a thief — you better keep your eyes on his hands which have begun clearing a clearing. here he plants a seed as small as his own fingernail, and shazam! it sprouts roots, shoots, stems, branches — a whole tree shouldering up, tossing and swaying in the air between the sun’s magic hands and the man’s indifferent eyes. next thing you know, an orphan index finger is worming its way across the stage that wasn’t a stage until your eyeing it made it so. it inches over to the tree like a lost knuckle finding its way home, its feelers testing, feeling, sniffing, finding purchase, finding a toe-hold, the tiny, spiny, hairy, leg-like appendages beginning to wiggle, to climb, to shinny up the tree, the elbow, the sheer escarpment, pausing to send out a line, a lasso, a long rope as fine as the filament of a spider launched from its abdomen and hooking the thumb of the lowest branch. a rope for rappelling, for jumping off this cliff, taking this dive, twisting as it untwists, enfolding as it unfolds, holding on for dear life as it spins itself into silk, those indifferent eyes almost imperceptibly squinting in sympathy with this closing up, this cloaking, this cloistering, this hanging upside down with a pulse inside. a fluttering pulse. a pulse like the flutter of eyelids. like the flutter of wings. a heartbeat growing stronger, stronger, breaking out, breaking free, the wings opening, the eyes opening as if all this time they were closed — the blank eyes opening to the wings, taking them in, incredulous, in love with them — and the black and white has grown iridescent; the orphaned knuckle has found the hands; the hands have found their wings, and we are all utterly blown away.  ian sanborn's asl poem may be viewed here .

 beyond the field of grazing, gazing cows the great bull has a pasture to himself, monumental, black flanks barely twitching from the swarming flies. only a few strands of wire separate us—how could i forget my childhood terror, the grownups warning that the old bull near my uncle’s farm would love to chase me, stomp me, gore me if i ever got too close. and so i skirted acres just to keep my distance, peeking through the leaves to see if he still was watching me, waiting for some foolish move— those fierce red eyes, the thunder in the ground— or maybe that was simply nightmares. it’s getting hard to tell, as years themselves keep gaining ground relentlessly, their hot breath on my back, and not a fence in sight.

NEW POEM
 forth from calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone, fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone: soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower, stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the star-bright air made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair. whence came change? was the sweet night weary of rest? what anguish awoke in the dark? sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark. lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky, living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die. heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire: thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire.  and the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free: and a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea. all the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught: and the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught. and madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind: and the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of ind. such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce east, rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest. the channel that sunders england from shores where never was man born free was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea. as a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall, the strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall. stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath, and she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death. three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy, filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy. for the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime as the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time. the glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard, the rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word, in the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea, and the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free. far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light from the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white. the leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade from the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made. far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune, shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon. the limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep as life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep. all glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below. the joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage, were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage. no thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare, illimitable, infinite, awful and joyful, alive in the summit of air— air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's, rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees. no love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams than the world shone then, when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath's length seems— one utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides as the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides. in the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld as a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled. as the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn. a thousand phosphors, a thousand hespers, awoke in the churning sea, and the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be; as a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep, audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep: too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake: light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake, in the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour, a harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower. and sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed when the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed. the glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died, not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride; with strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth, as a god that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new god's birth, the might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell: and the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell. the waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain, for the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain. and an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife; and the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life.

 like the waxwings in the juniper, a dozen at a time, divided, paired, passing the berries back and forth, and by nightfall, wobbling, piping, wounded with joy.  or a party of redwings grazing what falls—blossom and seed, nutmeat and fruit— made light in the head and cut by the light, swept from the ground, carried downwind, taken....  it's called wing-rowing, the wing-burdened arms unbending, yielding, striking a balance, walking the white invisible line drawn just ahead in the air, first sign the slur,  the liquid notes too liquid, the heart in the mouth melodious, too close, which starts the chanting, the crooning, the long lyric silences, the song of our undoing.  it's called side-step, head-forward, raised-crown, flap- and-glide-flight aggression, though courtship is the object, affection the compulsion, love the overspill—the body nodding,  still standing, ready to fly straight out of itself—or its bill-tilt, wing-flash, topple- over; wing-droop, bowing, tail-flick and drift; back-ruffle, wingspread, quiver and soar.  someone is troubled, someone is trying, in earnest, to explain; to speak without swallowing the tongue; to find the perfect word among so few or the too many—  to sing like the thrush from the deepest part of the understory, territorial, carnal, thorn-at-the-throat, or flutelike in order to make one sobering sound.  sound of the breath blown over the bottle, sound of the reveler home at dawn, light of the sun a warbler yellow, the sun in song-flight, lopsided-pose. be of good-cheer,  my father says, lifting his glass to greet a morning in which he's awake to be with the birds: or up all night in the sleep of the world, alive again, singing.

 ‘i have always felt that desolation, that hell itself, is most powerfully expressed in an uninhabited natural landscape at its bleakest.’ —anthony hecht 1.   to each his own hell. mine was an uninhabited landscape as far from nature as you can get without actually leaving the planet, a man-made  moon waste on sixth avenue in brooklyn, fired in the sun’s kiln through unending afternoons when i was nine or ten.  i can never get the whole scene put together in my head, thanks to whatever guardian spirit flags down potentially dangerous  intruders on the verge of memory, but parts of me hold parts of it: my ears play out the hissing wires’ repeated rise  and fall, dry waves breaking above pavement; my nostrils chafe where fumes of gasoline weep from soft tarred patches in the asphalt;  through a chainlink grid, my eyes take in some lot’s trapped beach, its black sand an amalgam of gravel, soot, and broken glass; or they blink  in sequence with the traffic light’s perpetual solitaire at a carless intersection, flicking over greens, ambers, reds;  my hands remember enough not to touch the shut steel trap doors of delivery chutes where air trembles over surfaces  as at their beginnings in a furnace. what fills my mind to bursting is emptiness, the spirit of inverted genesis  transforming light and water’s urge towards fullness into a miracle of unearthly loss.   2.   sentries, a pair of gasoline pumps napped. their rubber arms dangled groundwards and looped back up, hanging slack from the brass lapel  their trigger-fingers hooked at shoulder height. they were no angels, but kept the gate of hell whenever i made visits to the angels.  behind them, next to a roll-up garage door always rolled up, with an invisible car always risen above the stone lintel  on the hydraulic lift, a soft drink cooler sat coffin-like against the stucco wall. and always songs from a hidden radio  promised cool mountain rivers to the hot flat city: somebody else must have listened, but i never saw a soul in all my visits.  the angels’ wings fluttered the moment i raised the lid, a potent shimmer, as if the sun itself shone from the chest, not its reflections  playing off the steel bars and icy waters. the angels sat in rows between the bars, their orders chevroned by the shapes and colours  of their glass capes: the bluish, scalloped whorl of cherubim, the powers’ straight sheer crystal, the emerald flare of flaming seraphim—  all emissaries from the sky-washed shore of heaven. to put a coin in the dispenser, slide one of them along its plated channel  and lift it free through the chest’s narrow gate— to kiss the cold stars of its distillation— was not important; it was only important  to see the angels swimming in the glitter and dip my fingers in their flickering water at the centre of that man-made desert,  knowing that they were man-made, and might shatter.

 c. damon, come drive thy flocks this way. d. no, ’tis too late; they went astray. c. i have a grassy scutcheon spied, where flora blazons all her pride. the grass i aim to feast thy sheep: the flowers i for thy temples keep. d. grass withers; and the flowers too fade. c. seize the short joys then, ere they vade, seest thou that unfrequented cave? d. that den? c. love’s shrine. d. but virtue’s grave. c. in whose cool bosom we may lie safe from the sun. d. not heaven’s eye. c. near this, a fountain’s liquid bell tinkles within the concave shell. d. might a soul bathe there and be clean, or slake its drought? c. what is’t you mean? d. these once had been enticing things, clorinda, pastures, caves, and springs. c. and what late change? d. the other day pan met me. c. what did great pan say? d. words that transcend poor shepherds’ skill, but he e’er since my songs does fill: and his name swells my slender oat. c. sweet must pan sound in damon’s note. d. clorinda’s voice might make it sweet. c. who would not in pan’s praises meet?  chorus  of pan the flowery pastures sing, caves echo, and the fountains ring. sing then while he doth us inspire; for all the world is our pan’s choir.

 to fish from a cloud in the sky you must find a comfortable spot, spend a day looking down patiently, clear-sighted.  peer at your ceiling: where a light dangles, hook &amp; line could be slipping through.  under the hull of a boat a fish will see things this way,  looking up while swimming by —  a wavering pole’s refraction catching its eye.  what will you catch? with what sort of bait? take care or you’ll catch yourself,  a fish might say, as inescapable skeins of shadow scatter a net over the face of the deep.

 what you have heard is true. i was in his house. his wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar. his daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night. there were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. the moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. on the television was a cop show. it was in english. broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. on the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. we had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. the maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. i was asked how i enjoyed the country. there was a brief commercial in spanish. his wife took everything away. there was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. the parrot said hello on the terrace. the colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. my friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. the colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. he spilled many human ears on the table. they were like dried peach halves. there is no other way to say this. he took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. it came alive there. i am tired of fooling around he said. as for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them- selves. he swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. something for your poetry, no? he said. some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground. may 1978

 by a peninsula the painter sat and sketched the uneven valley groves. the apostle gave alms to the meek. the volcano burst in fusive sulphur and hurled rocks and ore into the air— heaven’s sudden change at the drawing tempestuous, darkening shade of dense clouded hues. the wanderer soon chose his spot of rest; they bore the chosen hero upon their shoulders, whom they strangely admired, as the beach-tide summer of people desired.

 get up, get up for shame, the blooming morne upon her wings presents the god unshorne. see how aurora throwes her faire fresh-quilted colours through the aire: get up, sweet-slug-a-bed, and see the dew-bespangling herbe and tree. each flower has wept, and bow'd toward the east, above an houre since; yet you not drest, nay! not so much as out of bed? when all the birds have mattens seyd, and sung their thankful hymnes: 'tis sin, nay, profanation to keep in, when as a thousand virgins on this day, spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in may.  rise; and put on your foliage, and be seene to come forth, like the spring-time, fresh and greene; and sweet as flora. take no care for jewels for your gowne, or haire: feare not; the leaves will strew gemms in abundance upon you: besides, the childhood of the day has kept, against you come, some orient pearls unwept: come, and receive them while the light hangs on the dew-locks of the night: and titan on the eastern hill retires himselfe, or else stands still till you come forth. wash, dresse, be briefe in praying: few beads are best, when once we goe a maying.  come, my corinna, come; and comming, marke how each field turns a street; each street a parke made green, and trimm'd with trees: see how devotion gives each house a bough, or branch: each porch, each doore, ere this, an arke a tabernacle is made up of white-thorn neatly enterwove; as if here were those cooler shades of love. can such delights be in the street, and open fields, and we not see't? come, we'll abroad; and let's obay the proclamation made for may: and sin no more, as we have done, by staying; but my corinna, come, let's goe a maying.  there's not a budding boy, or girle, this day, but is got up, and gone to bring in may. a deale of youth, ere this, is come back, and with white-thorn laden home. some have dispatcht their cakes and creame, before that we have left to dreame: and some have wept, and woo'd, and plighted troth, and chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth: many a green-gown has been given; many a kisse, both odde and even: many a glance too has been sent from out the eye, loves firmament: many a jest told of the keyes betraying this night, and locks pickt, yet w'are not a maying.  come, let us goe, while we are in our prime; and take the harmlesse follie of the time. we shall grow old apace, and die before we know our liberty. our life is short; and our dayes run as fast away as do's the sunne: and as a vapour, or a drop of raine once lost, can ne'r be found againe: so when or you or i are made a fable, song, or fleeting shade; all love, all liking, all delight lies drown'd with us in endlesse night. then while time serves, and we are but decaying; come, my corinna, come, let's goe a maying.

 i try to think of the cup of a hand, of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle  though even it, purpled, spiking away, wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle  a little for me. o every little thing wants to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry  that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly to the bloated hiss of death. to love is to be remiss:  the horse alone in the wide flat field nods its head as if the bridle and bit were missed  or mocked; the cow slung with the unmilked weight of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder  at o lonesome me. i want to say to her need as if crooning could be enough,  sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told, the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey  terrifies me. when the stink of slurry season is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,  overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit. then i dream a little dream of you  and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.  all night we glide to its blue harbor and back again. the fattened slack of us  singing o darlin' darlin' darlin'.

 1  flood-tide below me! i see you face to face! clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—i see you also face to face.  crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! on the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.  2  the impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, the simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, the similitudes of the past and those of the future, the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, the current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, the others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, the certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.  others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, others will watch the run of the flood-tide, others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west, and the heights of brooklyn to the south and east, others will see the islands large and small; fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, a hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.  3  it avails not, time nor place—distance avails not, i am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence, just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so i felt, just as any of you is one of a living crowd, i was one of a crowd, just as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, i was refresh’d, just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, i stood yet was hurried, just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, i look’d.  i too many and many a time cross’d the river of old, watched the twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow, saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south, saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water, had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams, look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water, look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward, look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet, look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving, saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me, saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor, the sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, the round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, the large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses, the white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, the flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset, the scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening, the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks, on the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, on the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night, casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.  4  these and all else were to me the same as they are to you, i loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river, the men and women i saw were all near to me, others the same—others who look back on me because i look’d forward to them, (the time will come, though i stop here to-day and to-night.)  5  what is it then between us? what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?  whatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not, i too lived, brooklyn of ample hills was mine, i too walk’d the streets of manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me, in the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me, in my walks home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me, i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, i too had receiv’d identity by my body, that i was i knew was of my body, and what i should be i knew i should be of my body.  6  it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, the dark threw its patches down upon me also, the best i had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious, my great thoughts as i supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil, i am he who knew what it was to be evil, i too knitted the old knot of contrariety, blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d, had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes i dared not speak, was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, the wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, the cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest, was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing, felt their arms on my neck as i stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as i sat, saw many i loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word, lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,  play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, the same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, or as small as we like, or both great and small.  7  closer yet i approach you, what thought you have of me now, i had as much of you—i laid in my stores in advance, i consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born.  who was to know what should come home to me? who knows but i am enjoying this? who knows, for all the distance, but i am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?  8  ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d manhattan? river and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide? the sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter?  what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices i love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as i approach? what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face? which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?  we understand then do we not? what i promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted? what the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not?  9  flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide! frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves! gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me! cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers! stand up, tall masts of mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of brooklyn! throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers! suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution! gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!  sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name! live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress! play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it! consider, you who peruse me, whether i may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air; receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water! come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters! flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset! burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!  appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, you necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, about my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas, thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.  you have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, we receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, we use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, we fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, you furnish your parts toward eternity, great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.

 what large, dark hands are those at the window lifted, grasping the golden light which weaves its way through the creeper leaves to my heart's delight?  ah, only the leaves! but in the west, in the west i see a redness come over the evening's burning breast — — 'tis the wound of love goes home!  the woodbine creeps abroad calling low to her lover: the sun-lit flirt who all the day has poised above her lips in play and stolen kisses, shallow and gay of pollen, now has gone away — she woos the moth with her sweet, low word, and when above her his broad wings hover then her bright breast she will uncover and yield her honey-drop to her lover.  into the yellow, evening glow saunters a man from the farm below, leans, and looks in at the low-built shed where hangs the swallow's marriage bed. the bird lies warm against the wall. she glances quick her startled eyes towards him, then she turns away her small head, making warm display of red upon the throat. his terrors sway her out of the nest's warm, busy ball, whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies in one blue stoop from out the sties into the evening's empty hall.  oh, water-hen, beside the rushes hide your quaint, unfading blushes, still your quick tail, and lie as dead, till the distance folds over his ominous tread.  the rabbit presses back her ears, turns back her liquid, anguished eyes and crouches low: then with wild spring spurts from the terror of his oncoming to be choked back, the wire ring her frantic effort throttling: piteous brown ball of quivering fears!  ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies, and swings all loose to the swing of his walk. yet calm and kindly are his eyes and ready to open in brown surprise should i not answer to his talk or should he my tears surmise.  i hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair watching the door open: he flashes bare his strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes in a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise he flings the rabbit soft on the table board and comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud his coming: he raises up my face to him and caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim of the rabbit's fur! god, i am caught in a snare! i know not what fine wire is round my throat, i only know i let him finger there my pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood: and down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down his dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood of sweet fire sweeps across me, so i drown within him, die, and find death good.

 two nights ago in the canyon darkness, only the half-moon and stars, only mere men. prayer, faith, love, existence. we are measured by vastness beyond ourselves. dark is light. stone is rising.  i don’t know if humankind understands culture: the act of being human is not easy knowledge.  with painted wooden sticks and feathers, we journey into the canyon toward stone, a massive presence in midwinter.  we stop. lean into me. the universe sings in quiet meditation.  we are wordless: i am in you.  without knowing why culture needs our knowledge, we are one self in the canyon. and the stone wall i lean upon spins me wordless and silent to the reach of stars and to the heavens within.  it’s not humankind after all nor is it culture that limits us. it is the vastness we do not enter. it is the stars we do not let own us.

 set up curbside, jewelry tray entanglement with things looking up, but nothing sells unless there is someone looking down, and who might that be? for the moment it’s not raining and off-coast in pods the gray whales parade south. photographs sprout with the season. the gray whale’s spout is heart shaped, enough said. just listen for the icon’s intake of breath and see what you can see. yes, but that was yesterday and which way are prices going to go? there is a pack forming and they will need a leader. it’s then you kick the snot out of them, not before, and make it believable this one last time; but don’t depend on it, auditors, even though it’s turned out like this so many times before. there may be an image whose mind has changed. sorry, no rain checks in this scheme of things, the windows are broken and boards keep out the light, it’s the cheapest thing to do and then forget it, as has been done before, before, etc. could you pick out of a lineup who is the culprit here? the mirror is one-way and there’s no way to be sure which side you’re on, but so what? go on making faces anyway, but be sure, now and then, to check your hand before your face, if just to say wheaties, the best is yet to be. our inventions, gods and needles, for instance, are built to say this to us ever and forever. it’s obvious why we can’t give them up, they’re ours, for ourself self’s sake! we live in the afterlife of what, unalterable, has already taken place. the minute you start acting like robinson crusoe it’s plain to see you’ve lost your hold on the world. there are many such, so many, washed up on our island shores! they end up sleeping over grates and in doorways at night, far distant from tree ripe fruit and warm sand. the dumps of our artifacts bewilder them. they probe, not knowing what to expect from excess. they act out an experiment, a hairline calculation for survival: is the expenditure of energy to dig up carrots from the frozen ground more than their return in calories? did you notice the price tag when the wine was poured, the cool chardonnay, the special cabernet, white and red absurdities of words? the motion lights are set to react outside the house but, tell me, did you see the clutter in the study, one would think! those catalogs, the cave, shadows.

NEW POEM
 prologue   animals tame and animals feral prowled the dark ages in search of a moral: the canine was loyal, the lion was virile, rabbits were potent and gryphons were sterile. sloth, envy, gluttony, pride—every peril was fleshed into something phantasmic and rural, while courage, devotion, thrift—every bright laurel crowned a creature in some mythological mural.  scientists think there is something immoral in singular brutes having meat that is plural: beasts are mere beasts, just as flowers are floral. yet between the lines there’s an implicit demurral; the habit stays with us, albeit it’s puerile: when darwin saw squirrels, he saw more than squirrel.   1. the ant   the ant, darwin reminded us, defies all simple-mindedness: take nothing (says the ant) on faith, and never trust a simple truth. the pr men of bestiaries eulogized for centuries this busy little paragon, nature’s proletarian— but look here, darwin said: some ants make slaves of smaller ants, and end exploiting in their peonages the sweating brows of their tiny drudges.  thus the ant speaks out of both sides of its mealy little mouth: its example is extolled to the workers of the world, but its habits also preach the virtues of the idle rich.   2. the worm   eyeless in gaza, earless in britain, lower than a rattlesnake’s belly-button, deaf as a judge and dumb as an audit: nobody gave the worm much credit till darwin looked a little closer at this spaghetti-torsoed loser. look, he said, a worm can feel and taste and touch and learn and smell; and ounce for ounce, they’re tough as wrestlers, and love can turn them into hustlers, and as to work, their labors are mythic, small devotees of the protestant ethic: they’ll go anywhere, to mountains or grassland, south to the rain forests, north to iceland, fifty thousand to every acre guzzling earth like a drunk on liquor, churning the soil and making it fertile, earning the thanks of every mortal: proud homo sapiens, with legs and arms— his whole existence depends on worms. so, history, no longer let the worm’s be an ignoble lot unwept, unhonored, and unsung. moral: even a worm can turn.   3. the rabbit   a.   except in distress, the rabbit is silent, but social as teacups: no hare is an island. (moral: silence is golden—or anyway harmless; rabbits may run, but never for congress.)  b.   when a rabbit gets miffed, he bounds in an orbit, kicking and scratching like—well, like a rabbit. (moral: to thine own self be true—or as true as you can; a wolf in sheep’s clothing fleeces his skin.)  c.   he populates prairies and mountains and moors, but in sweden the rabbit can’t live out of doors. (moral: to know your own strength, take a tug at your shackles; to understand purity, ponder your freckles.)  d.   survival developed these small furry tutors; the morals of rabbits outnumber their litters. (conclusion: you needn’t be brainy, benign, or bizarre to be thought a great prophet. endure. just endure.)   4. the gossamer   sixty miles from land the gentle trades that silk the yankee clippers to cathay sift a million gossamers, like tides of fluff above the menace of the sea.  these tiny spiders spin their bits of webbing and ride the air as schooners ride the ocean; the beagle trapped a thousand in its rigging, small aeronauts on some elusive mission.  the megatherium, done to extinction by its own bigness, makes a counterpoint to gossamers, who breathe us this small lesson: for survival, it’s the little things that count.

 after the summer's yield, lord, it is time to let your shadow lengthen on the sundials and in the pastures let the rough winds fly.  as for the final fruits, coax them to roundness. direct on them two days of warmer light to hale them golden toward their term, and harry the last few drops of sweetness through the wine.  whoever's homeless now, will build no shelter; who lives alone will live indefinitely so, waking up to read a little, draft long letters, and, along the city's avenues, fitfully wander, when the wild leaves loosen.

 i am not land or timber nor are you ocean or celestial body,  but rather we are the small animals we have always been.  the land and the sea know each other at the threshold  where they meet, as we know something of one another,  having shown, at different times, some bit of flesh,  some feeling.  we call the showing knowing instead of practice. we seem to say,  at different times, a feeling comes.  what is the metaphor for two animals sharing the same space?  marriage?  we share a practice, you and i, a series of postures.  here is how i become a tree [                            ]  and you [                            ] a body in space.

 a sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness; a lawn about the shoulders thrown into a fine distraction; an erring lace, which here and there enthrals the crimson stomacher; a cuff neglectful, and thereby ribands to flow confusedly; a winning wave, deserving note, in the tempestuous petticoat; a careless shoe-string, in whose tie i see a wild civility: do more bewitch me, than when art is too precise in every part.

NEW POEM
 touch and go. our cessna bumped the sand, thumped its tundra tires, lifted as if on wires, banked over ice and rocked its wings to land.  we pitched our camp hard by the hubbard’s face, some sixty fathoms tall, a seven-mile-long wall seven leagues from yakutat, our base.  
NEW POEM
 sometimes you watch them going out to sea on such a day as this, in the worst of weathers, their boat holding ten or a dozen of them, in black rubber suits crouched around the engine housing, tanks of air, straps and hoses, and for their feet enormous flippers.  the bow, with such a load on board, hammers through the whitecaps, while they talk; junonian girls, praxitelean boys, pelted on by bursting clouds, by spray, eventually heave the tanks upon their backs, the boat drifts at anchor,  and down they go to the sea floor, by the foggy headland. at least, you can presume they kick the flippers and plunge to where the water is more calm. the cool instructors must keep eyes and ears open. accidents out there, they happen.  you might imagine scraps of cultural débris, a broken pot, a ring, a cogwheel come up, clutched in a palm, and interesting, a wave pattern in it, the blade of a sword, when a lucky diver breaks again the surface. time, time and again frigate and schooner cracked blown against the rocks, holed below the water line.  even an inscription might now be coming up from those green deeps. yet the divers do their silent thing. on the sea floor expect only the sea, a multitude of sand without an hourglass. round somebody’s ankle idly it swarms. a diver hangs by a thread of breath in solitude there. some go down in all simplicity curious; to have tales to tell; and who knows, what they learn just might, long after this, be usable.  
NEW POEM
 inward lush unpetaling purpose in pink blooms of sleep, and i no longer needed to be separate. i was living there then, at the edge of the sea. and my friends came to visit, trying for a baby, not sure how to read me on that island of dozy sunlight. and there it was: familiarity edged with fear, the way we’d feed each other sandwiches and wonder if we should have wanted something other. we walked the folded cliffs over conifer fronds and mud runneling rocks slick with dropped fruit and rotting camellias to pause at the first ridge. we looked through high pines at the blue moving tides, then his finger caught a snag in the water and another and we saw — glinting fins wheeling the sheen, thousands playing in pods coming closer like the souls slippering into our bodies, attaching to matter as flippers angle into a ferrying strand. we too are a species, i realized. we too could know that as joy.  
NEW POEM
 the doubt of future foes exiles my present joy, and wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy; for falsehood now doth flow, and subjects’ faith doth ebb, which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web. but clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds, which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds. the top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be, and fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see. the dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds, shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds. the daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know. no foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port; our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort. my rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ to poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy.  
NEW POEM
 we drive between lakes just turning green; late june. the white turkeys have been moved a second time to new grass. how long the seconds are in great pain! terror just before death, shoulders torn, shot from helicopters. “i saw the boy being tortured with a telephone generator,” the sergeant said. “i felt sorry for him and blew his head off with a shotgun.” these instants become crystals, particles the grass cannot dissolve. our own gaiety will end up in asia, and you will look down in your cup and see black starfighters. our own cities were the ones we wanted to bomb! therefore we will have to go far away to atone for the suffering of the stringy-chested and the short rice-fed ones, quivering in the helicopter like wild animals, shot in the chest, taken back to be questioned.  
NEW POEM
 i i am driving; it is dusk; minnesota. the stubble field catches the last growth of sun. the soybeans are breathing on all sides. old men are sitting before their houses on car seats in the small towns. i am happy, the moon rising above the turkey sheds.  ii the small world of the car plunges through the deep fields of the night, on the road from willmar to milan. this solitude covered with iron moves through the fields of night penetrated by the noise of crickets.  iii nearly to milan, suddenly a small bridge, and water kneeling in the moonlight. in small towns the houses are built right on the ground; the lamplight falls on all fours on the grass. when i reach the river, the full moon covers it. a few people are talking, low, in a boat.  
NEW POEM
 when he tells the story now he's at the center of it,  everyone else in the house falling into the backdrop—  my mother, grandmother, an uncle, all dead now—props  in our story: father and daughter caught in memory's half-light.  i'm too young to recall it, so his story becomes the story:  1969, hurricane camille bearing down, the old house  shuddering as if it will collapse. rain pours into every room  and he has to keep moving, keep me out of harm's way—  a father's first duty: to protect. and so, in the story, he does:  i am small in his arms, perhaps even sleeping. water is rising  around us and there is no higher place he can take me  than this, memory forged in the storm's eye: a girl  clinging to her father. what can i do but this? let him  tell it again and again as if it's always been only us,  and that, when it mattered, he was the one who saved me.  
NEW POEM
 he could not die when trees were green, for he loved the time too well. his little hands, when flowers were seen, were held for the bluebell, as he was carried o'er the green.  his eye glanced at the white-nosed bee; he knew those children of the spring: when he was well and on the lea he held one in his hands to sing, which filled his heart with glee.  infants, the children of the spring! how can an infant die when butterflies are on the wing, green grass, and such a sky? how can they die at spring?  he held his hands for daisies white, and then for violets blue, and took them all to bed at night that in the green fields grew, as childhood's sweet delight.  and then he shut his little eyes, and flowers would notice not; birds' nests and eggs caused no surprise, he now no blossoms got; they met with plaintive sighs.  when winter came and blasts did sigh, and bare were plain and tree, as he for ease in bed did lie his soul seemed with the free, he died so quietly.  
NEW POEM
 he clasps the crag with crooked hands; close to the sun in lonely lands, ring'd with the azure world, he stands.  the wrinkled sea beneath him crawls; he watches from his mountain walls, and like a thunderbolt he falls.

 earth rais'd up her head, from the darkness dread &amp; drear. her light fled: stony dread! and her locks cover'd with grey despair.  prison'd on watry shore starry jealousy does keep my den cold and hoar weeping o'er i hear the father of the ancient men  selfish father of men cruel, jealous, selfish fear can delight chain'd in night the virgins of youth and morning bear.  does spring hide its joy when buds and blossoms grow? does the sower? sow by night? or the plowman in darkness plow?  break this heavy chain, that does freeze my bones around selfish! vain! eternal bane! that free love with bondage bound.

 the afterlife 1  spring, and the first full crop of dandelions gone to smoke, the lawn lumpish with goldfinches, hunched in their fluffs, fattened by seed, alight in the wind-bared peduncular forest. little bells, they loop and dive, bend the delicate birch branches down. i would enter the sky through the soil myself, sing up the snail bowers and go on the lam with the roots. licked by filaments, i would lie, a billion love-mouths to suckle and feed.  where the river will be next week, a puddle two trout go savagely dying in. notice the bland, darwinian sand: bone wrack and tree skin, the ground down moon bowls of mussels, viral stones dividing like mold. at twelve, i buried the frog because it was dead and dug it up because i'd been dreaming— a fish belly light, a lowly chirruped chorus of amens. i thought my nights might smell of hell.  bland, hum-drum, quotidian guilt— if i've killed one frog, i've killed two. saint rot and the sacraments of maggots: knowing is humus and sustenance is sex. it accrues and accrues, it stews tumorous with delight. tomorrow's a shovelful, the spit of the cosmos, one day the baby's breath is no longer a rose.  
NEW POEM
 1   i don’t understand this kindergarten assignment: “draw your clan.” the three letters live in abstraction. a friend suggests mine looks like his, minus legs, and that day i believe my clan is a species of amputee snipes, birds forced to fly the skies forever, and i wonder if we are meant to symbolize endurance or something beyond my five-year-old comprehension.   2   my mother explains we are not legless birds and if she had a more worldly vocabulary she would have suggested we were ambiguous, not quite a fish, more than a water snake, but she says we are among the few. the last tuscarora eel died out a generation ago, so we are left onondaga eels among the tuscarora, voiceless as well as legless.   3   i find an encyclopedia photo, see jagged rows of razor teeth in a mouth perpetually grinning and when i show it to her, she says clans are a system to keep track of families, so we don’t inadvertently marry our relatives, and that we have no more affinity with eels than anyone else on the reservation has with their animals.   4   “if i threw you in the dike,” she says “you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done with this lesson. i remember older cousins, swimming between my legs, and suddenly i am rising, their hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide with the backs of their necks, and they break the surface, toss me into deeper water, probably watching to make sure i surface, after they’ve had some amusement at my struggle.   5   in wet darkness, i imagine opening my eyes and mouth, taking water in, filling my lungs, discovering gills like aquaman or namor, the sub-mariner. knowing i had better odds of dying, face down, no voice to call out for help, i am never quite brave enough to try it, not daring enough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks the stillness of river water contained.   6   but i flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen to mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float, wondering what it would be like to glide the depths on fins, knowing if i were there, i would desire legs and lungs, and then i fill my chest to capacity, and dive, loving and begrudging the ache i find there, the throbbing of my chest begging for release, and i swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how long it will take to find the surface again.  
NEW POEM
 i just didn’t get it— even with the teacher holding an orange (the earth) in one hand and a lemon (the moon) in the other, her favorite student (the sun) standing behind her with a flashlight. i just couldn’t grasp it— this whole citrus universe, these bumpy planets revolving so slowly no one could even see themselves moving. i used to think if i could only concentrate hard enough i could be the one person to feel what no one else could, sense a small tug from the ground, a sky shift, the earth changing gears. even though i was only one mini-speck on a speck, even though i was merely a pinprick in one goosebump on the orange, i was sure then i was the most specially perceptive, perceptively sensitive. i was sure then my mother was the only mother to snap, “the world doesn’t revolve around you!” the earth was fragile and mostly water, just the way the orange was mostly water if you peeled it, just the way i was mostly water if you peeled me. looking back on that third grade science demonstration, i can understand why some people gave up on fame or religion or cures— especially people who have an understanding of the excruciating crawl of the world, who have a well-developed sense of spatial reasoning and the tininess that it is to be one of us. but not me—even now i wouldn’t mind being god, the force who spins the planets the way i spin a globe, a basketball, a yoyo. i wouldn’t mind being that teacher who chooses the fruit, or that favorite kid who gives the moon its glow.  
NEW POEM
 i was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile! four summer weeks i dwelt in sight of thee: i saw thee every day; and all the while thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea.  so pure the sky, so quiet was the air! so like, so very like, was day to day! whene'er i looked, thy image still was there; it trembled, but it never passed away.  how perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep; no mood, which season takes away, or brings: i could have fancied that the mighty deep was even the gentlest of all gentle things.  ah!then, if mine had been the painter's hand, to express what then i saw; and add the gleam, the light that never was, on sea or land, the consecration, and the poet's dream;  i would have planted thee, thou hoary pile amid a world how different from this! beside a sea that could not cease to smile; on tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.  thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;— of all the sunbeams that did ever shine the very sweetest had to thee been given.  a picture had it been of lasting ease, elysian quiet, without toil or strife; no motion but the moving tide, a breeze, or merely silent nature's breathing life.  such, in the fond illusion of my heart, such picture would i at that time have made: and seen the soul of truth in every part, a steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.  so once it would have been,—'tis so no more; i have submitted to a new control: a power is gone, which nothing can restore; a deep distress hath humanised my soul.  not for a moment could i now behold a smiling sea, and be what i have been: the feeling of my loss will ne'er be old; this, which i know, i speak with mind serene.  then, beaumont, friend! who would have been the friend, if he had lived, of him whom i deplore, this work of thine i blame not, but commend; this sea in anger, and that dismal shore.  o 'tis a passionate work!—yet wise and well, well chosen is the spirit that is here; that hulk which labours in the deadly swell, this rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!  and this huge castle, standing here sublime, i love to see the look with which it braves, cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, the lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves.  farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, housed in a dream, at distance from the kind! such happiness, wherever it be known, is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.  but welcome fortitude, and patient cheer, and frequent sights of what is to be borne! such sights, or worse, as are before me here.— not without hope we suffer and we mourn.  
NEW POEM
 i saw you fall to the ground. i saw the oaks fall.  the clouds collapsed. i saw a wildness twist through your limbs and fly off.  the river fell, the grasses fell. the backs of six drowned cattle rose to the surface ice—nothing moved. but a wind touched my ankles when the snow began. you left that night and we stayed, our arms braced with weight.  what power there was was over.  but i switched on the light by the porch to see if anything was falling— and it fell, a few glints in the air, catching sun although there was no sun, and the long descent over hours, all night, seemed like years, and we buried our faces in what came to rest on the ground or moved our feet over it, effortless, as nothing was in our lives, or ever will be.  
NEW POEM
 the country lies flat, expressionless as the face of a stranger. not one hillock shelters a buried bone. the city: a scene thin as a theater backdrop, where no doors open, no streets extend beyond the view from the corner.  only the railroad embankment is high, shaggy with grass. only the freight, knuckling a red sun under its wheels, drags familiar box-car shapes down long perspectives of childhood meals and all crossings at sunset.  with a look deep as the continent, with the casual greeting of those who will meet again, it bestrides the viaduct. its span is the span of trestles above mountain gorges, its roar the echo of streams still wearing away stone.  
NEW POEM
 an agitation of the air, a perturbation of the light admonished me the unloved year would turn on its hinge that night.  i stood in the disenchanted field amid the stubble and the stones, amazed, while a small worm lisped to me the song of my marrow-bones.  blue poured into summer blue, a hawk broke from his cloudless tower, the roof of the silo blazed, and i knew that part of my life was over.  already the iron door of the north clangs open: birds, leaves, snows order their populations forth, and a cruel wind blows.

 1  gently disintegrate me said nothing at all.  is there still time to say said i myself lying in a bower of bramble into which i have fallen.  look through my eyes up at blue with not anything we could have ever arranged slowly taking place.  above the spires of the fox gloves and above the bracken tops with their young heads recognising the wind, the armies of the empty blue press me further into zennor hill.  if i half-close my eyes the spiked light leaps in and i am here as near happy as i will get in the sailing afternoon.   2  enter a cloud. between the head of zennor and gurnard’s head the long marine horizon makes a blue wall or is it a distant table-top of the far-off simple sea.  enter a cloud. o cloud, i see you entering from your west gathering yourself together into a white headlong. and now you move and stream out of the gurnard, the west corner of my eye.  enter a cloud. the cloud’s changing shape is crossing slowly only an inch above the line of the sea. now nearly equidistant between zennor and gurnard’s head, an elongated white anvil is sailing not wanting to be a symbol.   3  said nothing at all.  and proceeds with no idea of destination along the sea bearing changing messages. jean in london, lifting a cup, looking abstractedly out through her hampstead glass will never be caught by your new shape above the chimneys. jean, jean, do you not see this cloud has been thought of and written on zennor hill.   4  the cloud is going beyond what i can see or make. over up-country maybe albert strick stops and waves caught in the middle of teeling broccoli for the winter. the cloud is not there yet.  from gurnard's head to zennor head the level line crosses my eyes lying on buzzing zennor hill.  the cloud is only a wisp and gone behind the head. it is funny i got the sea's horizontal slightly surrealist. now when i raise myself out of the bracken i see the long empty blue between the fishing gurnard and zennor. it was a cloud the language at my time's disposal made use of.   5  thank you. and for your applause. it has been a pleasure. i have never enjoyed speaking more. may i also thank the real ones who have made this possible. first, the cloud itself. and now gurnard's head and zennor head. also recognise how i have been helped by jean and madron's albert strick (he is a real man.) and good words like brambles, bower, spiked, fox, anvil, teeling.  the bees you heard are from a hive owned by my friend garfield down there below in the house by zennor church.  the good blue sun is pressing me into zennor hill.  gently disintegrate me said nothing at all.

 the flowering sea and the mountains in the moon’s waning the great stone close to the barbary figs and the asphodels the jar that refused to go dry at the end of day and the closed bed by the cypress trees and your hair golden; the stars of the swan and that other star, aldebaran.  i’ve kept a rein on my life, kept a rein on my life, travelling among yellow trees in driving rain on silent slopes loaded with beech leaves, no fire on their peaks; it’s getting dark. i’ve kept a rein on my life; on your left hand a line a scar at your knee, perhaps they exist on the sand of the past summer perhaps they remain there where the north wind blew as i hear an alien voice around the frozen lake. the faces i see do not ask questions nor does the woman bent as she walks giving her child the breast. i climb the mountains; dark ravines; the snow-covered plain, into the distance stretches the snow-covered plain, they ask nothing neither time shut up in dumb chapels nor hands outstretched to beg, nor the roads. i’ve kept a rein on my life whispering in a boundless silence i no longer know how to speak nor how to think; whispers like the breathing of the cypress tree that night like the human voice of the night sea on pebbles like the memory of your voice saying ‘happiness’.  i close my eyes looking for the secret meeting-place of the waters under the ice the sea’s smile, the closed wells groping with my veins for those veins that escape me there where the water-lilies end and that man who walks blindly across the snows of silence. i’ve kept a rein on my life, with him, looking for the water that touches you heavy drops on green leaves, on your face in the empty garden, drops in the motionless reservoir striking a swan dead in its white wings living trees and your eyes riveted.  this road has no end, has no relief, however hard you try to recall your childhood years, those who left, those lost in sleep, in the graves of the sea, however much you ask bodies you’ve loved to stoop under the harsh branches of the plane trees there where a ray of the sun, naked, stood still and a dog leapt and your heart shuddered, the road has no relief; i’ve kept a rein on my life.  the snow and the water frozen in the hoofmarks of the horses.  
NEW POEM
 karshish, the picker-up of learning's crumbs, the not-incurious in god's handiwork (this man's-flesh he hath admirably made, blown like a bubble, kneaded like a paste, to coop up and keep down on earth a space that puff of vapour from his mouth, man's soul) —to abib, all-sagacious in our art, breeder in me of what poor skill i boast, like me inquisitive how pricks and cracks befall the flesh through too much stress and strain, whereby the wily vapour fain would slip back and rejoin its source before the term,— and aptest in contrivance (under god) to baffle it by deftly stopping such:— the vagrant scholar to his sage at home sends greeting (health and knowledge, fame with peace) three samples of true snakestone—rarer still, one of the other sort, the melon-shaped, (but fitter, pounded fine, for charms than drugs) and writeth now the twenty-second time.  my journeyings were brought to jericho; thus i resume. who studious in our art shall count a little labour unrepaid? i have shed sweat enough, left flesh and bone on many a flinty furlong of this land. also, the country-side is all on fire with rumours of a marching hitherward: some say vespasian cometh, some, his son. a black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear; lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls: i cried and threw my staff and he was gone. twice have the robbers stripped and beaten me, and once a town declared me for a spy; but at the end, i reach jerusalem, since this poor covert where i pass the night, this bethany, lies scarce the distance thence a man with plague-sores at the third degree runs till he drops down dead. thou laughest here! 'sooth, it elates me, thus reposed and safe, to void the stuffing of my travel-scrip and share with thee whatever jewry yields a viscid choler is observable in tertians, i was nearly bold to say; and falling-sickness hath a happier cure than our school wots of: there's a spider here weaves no web, watches on the ledge of tombs, sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back; take five and drop them . . . but who knows his mind, the syrian runagate i trust this to? his service payeth me a sublimate blown up his nose to help the ailing eye. best wait: i reach jerusalem at morn, there set in order my experiences, gather what most deserves, and give thee all— or i might add, judea's gum-tragacanth scales off in purer flakes, shines clearer-grained, cracks 'twixt the pestle and the porphyry, in fine exceeds our produce. scalp-disease confounds me, crossing so with leprosy— thou hadst admired one sort i gained at zoar— but zeal outruns discretion. here i end.  yet stay: my syrian blinketh gratefully, protesteth his devotion is my price— suppose i write what harms not, though he steal? i half resolve to tell thee, yet i blush, what set me off a-writing first of all. an itch i had, a sting to write, a tang! for, be it this town's barrenness—or else the man had something in the look of him— his case has struck me far more than 'tis worth. so, pardon if—(lest presently i lose in the great press of novelty at hand the care and pains this somehow stole from me) i bid thee take the thing while fresh in mind, almost in sight—for, wilt thou have the truth? the very man is gone from me but now, whose ailment is the subject of discourse. thus then, and let thy better wit help all!  'tis but a case of mania—subinduced by epilepsy, at the turning-point of trance prolonged unduly some three days: when, by the exhibition of some drug or spell, exorcization, stroke of art unknown to me and which 'twere well to know, the evil thing out-breaking all at once left the man whole and sound of body indeed,— but, flinging (so to speak) life's gates too wide, making a clear house of it too suddenly, the first conceit that entered might inscribe whatever it was minded on the wall so plainly at that vantage, as it were, (first come, first served) that nothing subsequent attaineth to erase those fancy-scrawls the just-returned and new-established soul hath gotten now so thoroughly by heart that henceforth she will read or these or none. and first—the man's own firm conviction rests that he was dead (in fact they buried him) —that he was dead and then restored to life by a nazarene physician of his tribe: —'sayeth, the same bade "rise," and he did rise. "such cases are diurnal," thou wilt cry. not so this figment!—not, that such a fume, instead of giving way to time and health, should eat itself into the life of life, as saffron tingeth flesh, blood, bones and all! for see, how he takes up the after-life. the man—it is one lazarus a jew, sanguine, proportioned, fifty years of age, the body's habit wholly laudable, as much, indeed, beyond the common health as he were made and put aside to show. think, could we penetrate by any drug and bathe the wearied soul and worried flesh, and bring it clear and fair, by three days' sleep! whence has the man the balm that brightens all? this grown man eyes the world now like a child. some elders of his tribe, i should premise, led in their friend, obedient as a sheep, to bear my inquisition. while they spoke, now sharply, now with sorrow,—told the case,— he listened not except i spoke to him, but folded his two hands and let them talk, watching the flies that buzzed: and yet no fool. and that's a sample how his years must go. look, if a beggar, in fixed middle-life, should find a treasure,—can he use the same with straitened habits and with tastes starved small, and take at once to his impoverished brain the sudden element that changes things, that sets the undreamed-of rapture at his hand and puts the cheap old joy in the scorned dust? is he not such an one as moves to mirth— warily parsimonious, when no need, wasteful as drunkenness at undue times? all prudent counsel as to what befits the golden mean, is lost on such an one the man's fantastic will is the man's law. so here—we call the treasure knowledge, say, increased beyond the fleshly faculty— heaven opened to a soul while yet on earth, earth forced on a soul's use while seeing heaven: the man is witless of the size, the sum, the value in proportion of all things, or whether it be little or be much. discourse to him of prodigious armaments assembled to besiege his city now, and of the passing of a mule with gourds— 'tis one! then take it on the other side, speak of some trifling fact—he will gaze rapt with stupor at its very littleness, (far as i see) as if in that indeed he caught prodigious import, whole results; and so will turn to us the bystanders in ever the same stupor (note this point) that we too see not with his opened eyes. wonder and doubt come wrongly into play, preposterously, at cross purposes. should his child sicken unto death,—why, look for scarce abatement of his cheerfulness, or pretermission of the daily craft! while a word, gesture, glance, from that same child at play or in the school or laid asleep, will startle him to an agony of fear, exasperation, just as like. demand the reason why—" tis but a word," object— "a gesture"—he regards thee as our lord who lived there in the pyramid alone looked at us (dost thou mind?) when, being young, we both would unadvisedly recite some charm's beginning, from that book of his, able to bid the sun throb wide and burst all into stars, as suns grown old are wont. thou and the child have each a veil alike thrown o'er your heads, from under which ye both stretch your blind hands and trifle with a match over a mine of greek fire, did ye know! he holds on firmly to some thread of life— (it is the life to lead perforcedly) which runs across some vast distracting orb of glory on either side that meagre thread, which, conscious of, he must not enter yet— the spiritual life around the earthly life: the law of that is known to him as this, his heart and brain move there, his feet stay here. so is the man perplext with impulses sudden to start off crosswise, not straight on, proclaiming what is right and wrong across, and not along, this black thread through the blaze— "it should be" baulked by "here it cannot be." and oft the man's soul springs into his face as if he saw again and heard again his sage that bade him "rise" and he did rise. something, a word, a tick of the blood within admonishes: then back he sinks at once to ashes, who was very fire before, in sedulous recurrence to his trade whereby he earneth him the daily bread; and studiously the humbler for that pride, professedly the faultier that he knows god's secret, while he holds the thread of life. indeed the especial marking of the man is prone submission to the heavenly will— seeing it, what it is, and why it is. 'sayeth, he will wait patient to the last for that same death which must restore his being to equilibrium, body loosening soul divorced even now by premature full growth: he will live, nay, it pleaseth him to live so long as god please, and just how god please. he even seeketh not to please god more (which meaneth, otherwise) than as god please. hence, i perceive not he affects to preach the doctrine of his sect whate'er it be, make proselytes as madmen thirst to do: how can he give his neighbour the real ground, his own conviction? ardent as he is— call his great truth a lie, why, still the old "be it as god please" reassureth him. i probed the sore as thy disciple should: "how, beast," said i, "this stolid carelessness sufficeth thee, when rome is on her march to stamp out like a little spark thy town, thy tribe, thy crazy tale and thee at once?" he merely looked with his large eyes on me. the man is apathetic, you deduce? contrariwise, he loves both old and young, able and weak, affects the very brutes and birds—how say i? flowers of the field— as a wise workman recognizes tools in a master's workshop, loving what they make. thus is the man as harmless as a lamb: only impatient, let him do his best, at ignorance and carelessness and sin— an indignation which is promptly curbed: as when in certain travels i have feigned to be an ignoramus in our art according to some preconceived design, and happed to hear the land's practitioners, steeped in conceit sublimed by ignorance, prattle fantastically on disease, its cause and cure—and i must hold my peace!  thou wilt object—why have i not ere this sought out the sage himself, the nazarene who wrought this cure, inquiring at the source, conferring with the frankness that befits? alas! it grieveth me, the learned leech perished in a tumult many years ago, accused,—our learning's fate,—of wizardry, rebellion, to the setting up a rule and creed prodigious as described to me. his death, which happened when the earthquake fell (prefiguring, as soon appeared, the loss to occult learning in our lord the sage who lived there in the pyramid alone) was wrought by the mad people—that's their wont! on vain recourse, as i conjecture it, to his tried virtue, for miraculous help— how could he stop the earthquake? that's their way! the other imputations must be lies: but take one, though i loathe to give it thee, in mere respect for any good man's fame. (and after all, our patient lazarus is stark mad; should we count on what he says? perhaps not: though in writing to a leech 'tis well to keep back nothing of a case.) this man so cured regards the curer, then as—god forgive me! who but god himself, creator and sustainer of the world, that came and dwelt in flesh on 't awhile! —'sayeth that such an one was born and lived, taught, healed the sick, broke bread at his own house, then died, with lazarus by, for aught i know, and yet was . . . what i said nor choose repeat, and must have so avouched himself, in fact, in hearing of this very lazarus who saith—but why all this of what he saith? why write of trivial matters, things of price calling at every moment for remark? i noticed on the margin of a pool blue-flowering borage, the aleppo sort, aboundeth, very nitrous. it is strange!  thy pardon for this long and tedious case, which, now that i review it, needs must seem unduly dwelt on, prolixly set forth! nor i myself discern in what is writ good cause for the peculiar interest and awe indeed this man has touched me with. perhaps the journey's end, the weariness had wrought upon me first. i met him thus: i crossed a ridge of short sharp broken hills like an old lion's cheek teeth. out there came a moon made like a face with certain spots multiform, manifold, and menacing: then a wind rose behind me. so we met in this old sleepy town at unaware, the man and i. i send thee what is writ. regard it as a chance, a matter risked to this ambiguous syrian—he may lose, or steal, or give it thee with equal good. jerusalem's repose shall make amends for time this letter wastes, thy time and mine; till when, once more thy pardon and farewell!  the very god! think, abib; dost thou think? so, the all-great, were the all-loving too— so, through the thunder comes a human voice saying, "o heart i made, a heart beats here! face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself! thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine, but love i gave thee, with myself to love, and thou must love me who have died for thee!" the madman saith he said so: it is strange.

 in the woods off ivory, just out of car-shot it’s not enough to say a mouse lies snug  in a crib of roots, its fur sleek as babyskin, lord the body warm. too often a name  subverts the pang it answers for, inwit of heart-light, the epiphanic clutch. i mean  do you sense with more than a chill the tiny homely lumpliness of it there in the dirt  as you orphan the dim of a cold october sun, no wound i can find anywhere  on its, your, my small soft bodykins—yikes its left ear (the inner skin pink  delicate svelte) twitches a little and i have this before thought tricks it  whimsically lovely wink of the soul as mouse-force taking wing until the o-no  letdown when a yellow jacket backs out, o sweetmeat funk and dandle of the brain  asputter as it launches over frost-curled leaves and dollarweed seed strewn on the path  like medallions glimpsed the second we— i mean all of us cold in the twilight—fly.

 our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us . . . wearied we keep awake because the night is silent . . . low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient . . . worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous, but nothing happens.  watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire, like twitching agonies of men among its brambles. northward, incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles, far off, like a dull rumour of some other war. what are we doing here?  the poignant misery of dawn begins to grow . . . we only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy. dawn massing in the east her melancholy army attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of grey, but nothing happens.  sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence. less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow, with sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause, and renew, we watch them wandering up and down the wind's nonchalance, but nothing happens.  pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces— we cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed, deep into grassier ditches. so we drowse, sun-dozed, littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses. —is it that we are dying?  slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires, glozed with crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there; for hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs; shutters and doors, all closed: on us the doors are closed,— we turn back to our dying.  since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn; now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit. for god's invincible spring our love is made afraid; therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born, for love of god seems dying.  tonight, this frost will fasten on this mud and us, shrivelling many hands, and puckering foreheads crisp. the burying-party, picks and shovels in shaking grasp, pause over half-known faces. all their eyes are ice, but nothing happens.

 when first, descending from the moorlands, i saw the stream of yarrow glide along a bare and open valley, the ettrick shepherd was my guide.  when last along its banks i wandered, through groves that had begun to shed their golden leaves upon the pathways, my steps the border-minstrel led.  the mighty minstrel breathes no longer, 'mid mouldering ruins low he lies; and death upon the braes of yarrow, has closed the shepherd-poet's eyes:  nor has the rolling year twice measured, from sign to sign, its stedfast course, since every mortal power of coleridge was frozen at its marvellous source;  the rapt one, of the godlike forehead, the heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth: and lamb, the frolic and the gentle, has vanished from his lonely hearth.  like clouds that rake the mountain-summits, or waves that own no curbing hand, how fast has brother followed brother, from sunshine to the sunless land!  yet i, whose lids from infant slumber were earlier raised, remain to hear a timid voice, that asks in whispers, "who next will drop and disappear?"  our haughty life is crowned with darkness, like london with its own black wreath, on which with thee, o crabbe! forth-looking, i gazed from hampstead's breezy heath.  as if but yesterday departed, thou too art gone before; but why, o'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered, should frail survivors heave a sigh?  mourn rather for that holy spirit, sweet as the spring, as ocean deep; for her who, ere her summer faded, has sunk into a breathless sleep.  no more of old romantic sorrows, for slaughtered youth or love-lorn maid! with sharper grief is yarrow smitten, and ettrick mourns with her their poet dead.

 1. through the night the apples outside my window one by one let go their branches and drop to the lawn. i can’t see, but hear the stem-snap, the plummet through leaves, then the final thump against the ground.  sometimes two at once, or one right after another. during long moments of silence i wait and wonder about the bruised bodies, the terror of diving through air, and think i’ll go tomorrow to find the newly fallen, but they all look alike lying there dewsoaked, disappearing before me.  2. i lie beneath my window listening to the sound of apples dropping in  the yard, a syncopated code i long to know, which continues even as i sleep, and dream i know  the meaning of what i hear, each dull thud of unseen apple-  body, the earth falling to earth  once and forever, over and over.

 olive seashells in the air  you can eat. the very inner of the inner ear  in the breeze. last night my son dreamt  about falling out of trees.  i had almost forgotten that we were  simians.  the fiddlehead turns on itself but only ever in love.  green cinnamon roll, a snake too small to hunt  anyone. curled in like my son’s fingers, his fists.  more beautiful than a spider fern,  spun-in island, moldy tongue of a hippopotamus,  the eye of the forest.  when my son wakes up screaming  i don’t pick him up right away.  i tell him where he is and who i am.  at night all the fiddlehead wants to do is sleep.  when i sleep i dream about death adders curling  around his soft body,  all of us making the same kinds of sounds.

 the curtains part: it is a summer’s day. there a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow. the bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane’s fabric... suddenly the aeroplane’s engine ignites; the meadow is dark blue smoke... the aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull. as the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle. the bloody nostrils, a ring through them, are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth. the bull, blood oozing from the stump of its face, backs off, and charges again. this time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree. the headless bull backs off once more, and then charges down again. the propeller beating at the headless bull, cutting the body away in a great halo of blood, until only the back legs are standing. these run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags, until at last they find the aeroplane again. and as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart. the legs, one with the tail still attached to it, the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles, scamper off in opposite directions. the aeroplane turns away; the engine stops. the shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form. the watching cow begins to low ...

 i like to touch your tattoos in complete darkness, when i can’t see them. i’m sure of where they are, know by heart the neat lines of lightning pulsing just above your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent twists, facing a dragon. when i pull you  to me, taking you until we’re spent and quiet on the sheets, i love to kiss the pictures in your skin. they’ll last until you’re seared to ashes; whatever persists or turns to pain between us, they will still be there. such permanence is terrifying. so i touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying.

 one  green moves through the tops of trees and grows lighter greens as it recedes, each of which includes a grey, and among the greys, or beyond them, waning finely into white, there is one white spot, absolute; it could be an egret or perhaps a crane at the edge of the water where it meets a strip of sand.    two   there is a single, almost dazzling white spot of a white house out loud against the fields, and the forest in lines receding, rises, and then planes. color,  in pieces or entire; its presence veneers over want; in all its moving parts, it could be something else  half-hidden by trees. conservatory, gloriette, gazebo, or bandshell, a door ajar on the top floor.    three the trees are half air. they fissure the sky; you could count the leaves, pare time defined as that which, no matter how barely, exceeds what the eye could grasp in a glance; intricate woods opening out before a body of water edged with a swatch of meadow where someone has hung a bright white sheet out in the sun to dry.    four  a white bird in a green forest is a danger to itself. stands out. shines. builds up inside. like it’s dangerous to cry while driving or to talk to strangers or to stare at the sun and a thousand other things we’ve always heard people who wear white see better at night, though they gradually lose this trait as they age.    five  the air across the valley is slightly hazy though thinning though patches remain between the groves of trees that edge a clearing in which stands a single house. a child in a white t-shirt has just walked out of the house and is turning to walk down to the lake.

 boston common, december 6, 1882 during the transit of venus i love all sights of earth and skies, from flowers that glow to stars that shine; the comet and the penny show, all curious things, above, below, hold each in turn my wandering eyes: i claim the christian pagan’s line, humani nihil,—even so,— and is not human life divine?  when soft the western breezes blow, and strolling youths meet sauntering maids, i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our much-enduring elms bestow; the vender and his rhetoric’s flow, that lambent stream of liquid lies; the bait he dangles from his line, the gudgeon and his gold-washed prize. i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire, the little hero of the hunch, with iron arm and soul of fire, and will that works his fierce desire,— untamed, unscared, unconquered punch! my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds,— the dame sans merci’s broken strain, whom i erewhile, perchance, have known, when orleans filled the bourbon throne, a siren singing by the seine.  but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march; that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets’ disks, as if to blind their blood-shot eyes; or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run, to pop like corn that children parch, from summer something overdone, and roll, a cinder, through the skies.  grudge not to-day the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament, to whom the milky way is free; who holds the wondrous crystal key, the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent; who takes his toll, and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star. if venus only comes to time, (and prophets say she must and shall,) to-day will hear the tinkling chime of many a ringing silver dime, for him whose optic glass supplies the crowd with astronomic eyes,— the galileo of the mall.  dimly the transit morning broke; the sun seemed doubting what to do, as one who questions how to dress, and takes his doublets from the press, and halts between the old and new. please heaven he wear his suit of blue, or don, at least, his ragged cloak, with rents that show the azure through!  i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern, the last new-comer of the file, and wait, and wait, a weary while, and gape, and stretch, and shrug, and smile, (for each his place must fairly earn, hindmost and foremost, in his turn,) till hitching onward, pace by pace, i gain at last the envied place, and pay the white exiguous coin: the sun and i are face to face; he glares at me, i stare at him; and lo! my straining eye has found a little spot that, black and round, lies near the crimsoned fire-orb’s rim. o blessed, beauteous evening star, well named for her whom earth adores,— the lady of the dove-drawn car,— i know thee in thy white simar; but veiled in black, a rayless spot, blank as a careless scribbler’s blot, stripped of thy robe of silvery flame,— the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors,— i see thee, yet i know thee not; and canst thou call thyself the same?  a black, round spot,—and that is all; and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see.  and art thou, then, a world like ours, flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone? how must thy burning sands absorb the fire-waves of the blazing orb, thy chain so short, thy path so near, thy flame-defying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere! and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers? and hast thou cities, domes, and towers, and life, and love that makes it dear, and death that fills thy tribes with fear?  lost in my dream, my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know; my all-pervading thought explores the azure ocean’s lucent shores; i leave my mortal self below, as up the star-lit stairs i climb, and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time. new spheres, new suns, new systems gleam; the voice no earth-born echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears: i hear them “singing as they shine”— a mortal’s voice dissolves my dream: my patient neighbor, next in line, hints gently there are those who wait. o guardian of the starry gate, what coin shall pay this debt of mine? too slight thy claim, too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscan’s hand has placed in thine. forgive my own the small affront, the insult of the proffered dime; take it, o friend, since this thy wont, but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee, and pay thee with a grateful rhyme.

 harmonious powers with nature work on sky, earth, river, lake, and sea: sunshine and storm, whirlwind and breeze all in one duteous task agree.  once did i see a slip of earth, by throbbing waves long undermined, loosed from its hold; —how no one knew but all might see it float, obedient to the wind.  might see it, from the mossy shore dissevered float upon the lake, float, with its crest of trees adorned on which the warbling birds their pastime take.  food, shelter, safety there they find there berries ripen, flowerets bloom; there insects live their lives — and die: a peopled world it is; in size a tiny room.  and thus through many seasons’ space this little island may survive but nature, though we mark her not, will take away — may cease to give.  perchance when you are wandering forth upon some vacant sunny day without an object, hope, or fear, thither your eyes may turn — the isle is passed away.  buried beneath the glittering lake! its place no longer to be found, yet the lost fragments shall remain, to fertilize some other ground.

 among the many lives you’ll never lead, consider that of the wolverine, for whom avalanche is opportunity, who makes a festival of frozen marrow from the femur of an elk, who wears the crooked north star like an amulet  of teeth. in the game of which animal would you return as, today i’m thinking snowshoe hare, a scuffle in the underbrush, one giant leap. you never see them coming and going, only the crosshairs  of their having passed, ascending the ridge, lost or not lost in succession forests giving way to open meadow where deep snow lingers and finally relents, uncovering acres of lily — glacier yellow, avalanche  white — daylight restaking its earthly claim. every season swallows someone — granite mountain with its blunderbuss gullies, tatoosh a lash on the tongue, those climbers caught if not unawares  then perfectly hapless, not thinking of riding that snowstorm to the summit, not thinking wolverine fever in the shivering blood, not thinking steelhead cutthroat rainbow or the languid river that will carry them out.

 you are smaller than i remember and so is the house, set downhill afloat in a sea of scrub oak. from up here it’s an ordinary box with gravel  spread over its lid, weighting it, but inside it’s full of shadows and sky. clouds pull themselves over dry grass, which, if  i’m not mistaken, will erupt  any minute in flame. only a spark, a sunbeam focused. from up here, enjoying the view, i can finally take you in. will you wave back? i keep  slingshotting around. there’s gravity for you, but all i ever wanted was to fly.

 it mounts at sea, a concave wall down-ribbed with shine, and pushes forward, building tall its steep incline.  then from their hiding rise to sight black shapes on boards bearing before the fringe of white it mottles towards.  their pale feet curl, they poise their weight with a learn’d skill. it is the wave they imitate keeps them so still.  the marbling bodies have become half wave, half men, grafted it seems by feet of foam some seconds, then,  late as they can, they slice the face in timed procession: balance is triumph in this place, triumph possession.  the mindless heave of which they rode a fluid shelf breaks as they leave it, falls and, slowed, loses itself.  clear, the sheathed bodies slick as seals loosen and tingle; and by the board the bare foot feels the suck of shingle.  they paddle in the shallows still; two splash each other; then all swim out to wait until the right waves gather.

 a black cat among roses, phlox, lilac-misted under a first-quarter moon, the sweet smells of heliotrope and night-scented stock. the garden is very still, it is dazed with moonlight, contented with perfume, dreaming the opium dreams of its folded poppies. firefly lights open and vanish high as the tip buds of the golden glow low as the sweet alyssum flowers at my feet. moon-shimmer on leaves and trellises, moon-spikes shafting through the snow ball bush. only the little faces of the ladies’ delight are alert and staring, only the cat, padding between the roses, shakes a branch and breaks the chequered pattern as water is broken by the falling of a leaf. then you come, and you are quiet like the garden, and white like the alyssum flowers, and beautiful as the silent sparks of the fireflies. ah, beloved, do you see those orange lilies? they knew my mother, but who belonging to me will they know when i am gone.

 i   gilgamesh spoke and said to the old man then: "when i looked at you i thought that you were not  a man, one made like me; i had resolved to challenge you as one might challenge a demon,  a stranger-adversary. but now i see that you are utnapishtim, made like me,  a man, the one i sought, the one from whom i might find out how death can be avoided.  tell me then, father, how it came about that you were admitted to the company  of gods, who granted you eternal life." the father utnapishtim spoke and said:  "i will tell gilgamesh the king the story; a secret of the gods i will disclose.  there was an ancient city, shuruppak— you know of it—most fortunate of cities,  god-favored, on the banks of the euphrates. the gods in heaven decided in their council  to bring the flood down on the fortunate city. they sat in secret council together, deciding.  anu was there, the councilor enlil, ninurta of the silence, and there also  was the god ennugi, monitor of canals. and there was ea, cleverest of the gods.  the voice of ea telling me the secret came whispering through the reed walls of my house:  'you reed house walls, listen and hear me whisper; listen and be attentive to what i tell you.  utnapishtim, son of ubartutu, abandon your house, abandon what you possess,  abandon your house and build a boat instead. seek life instead of riches, save yourself.  take with you, on the boat you build, an instance of each thing living so that they may be  safe from obliteration in the flood. perform the construction of the boat with care.  let the length of the boat and the width of the boat be equal. roof over the boat as the abyss is roofed.'  the whispering voice spoke through the rustling walls: you reed house walls, listen and hear what i say.'  i listened and heard and spoke to the whispering voice: 'i hear what you say. what will i tell the others?  what will i tell the old men and the people?' ea the god whispered to me, his servant:  'tell them you can no longer live in the city, because you are out of favor with enlil.  the city is the city of enlil, and therefore utnapishtim, whom he hates,  must find another domicile and another god who will be his patron and protector,  and you have therefore decided to depart from shuruppak and seek another home.  tell them ea the god will be your patron, whose domicile is apsu the abyss.  under the roof of apsu is where you go. as for the city, fortunate shuruppak,  in the morning dawning, abundance will then rain down: there will be plenty, a flood of bounty, the city  teeming with heaven's profusion, game birds falling, fishes unheard-of before in song or story,  tumbling loaves of fresh-baked morning bread; grain will come showering in from all the grain fields;  a harvest of everything, yes, more than enough. these are the things to tell the elders and people.'   ii  "in the first hours of the early morning dawning, all the people came out for the boat-building,  the little children, the weak as well as the strong, everyone carrying something: asphalt, and oil,  and pitch, the best of timber with which to build. day after day i labored building the boat.  ten times a dozen cubits were the walls; ten times a dozen cubits was each deck.  there were six decks; the cabin was divided into nine compartments. i made up the plans;  i drew a picture of them for our guidance. i hammered the boat together, and plugged the holes  with water plugs to keep the water out. i made the bitumen pitch in the pitch kiln,  three sar of bitumen pitch to caulk the hull and, to be certain, three sar to caulk the inside.  i counted punting poles and put them aboard; i had the basket bearers stow the supplies  of oil and foodstuffs, everything i needed. as for the people who came to help in the work  each day was like a new year's holiday: i slaughtered sheep and bullocks for their feasting;  for drinking there was wine and beer, plenty, as if there was a river overflowing.  on the seventh day i finished building the boat. i opened a bowl of ointment for my hands.  i commanded the loading of everything i owned that could be carried, silver, and gold, and all  the instances of living things to be saved from obliteration in the flood;  and all my household people i took with me. at sunset on that day i launched the boat.  the launching was very hard to manage. it took much shifting and much maneuvering on the ways  to get the unwieldy boat down into the river, and two-thirds of its weight under the water  in order to prevent it from capsizing. as darkness was coming on i heard the god:  'abundance will rain down, more than enough! get yourself inside, and close the hatch!'  i saw the signs of morning in the sky. 'abundance will rain down, more than enough!'  i got myself inside, and closed the hatch. to puzuramurri the caulker, who, outside,  caulked up the hatch with pitch, i gave my house.   iii  "in the early hours of the next morning dawning there was the noise of adad in the clouds  that rose and filled the morning sky with blackness. shullat the herald of the dread adad  moved out over the mountains and over the valleys, bellowing; hanish the herald of the dread  adad moved over the plains and over the cities; everything turned to darkness as to night.  from time to time the annunaki blazed terrible light. then rain came down in floods.  beneath, the god of the underworld, nergal, broke down his own doorposts and opened the earth.  ninurta god of chaos and of war opened the dikes, and other floods burst forth.  the south wind rushed in flooding over the mountains. brother could not see brother in the welter;  none of the gods in heaven could see the earth; the land was shattered like a shattered pot;  confusions of dread adad were everywhere. terrified gods got themselves up as high  as they could go, nearest the highest heaven, cringing against the wall like beaten dogs.  ishtar cried out like a woman in her birth pangs, the sweet-voiced lady cried: "the days that were  have now become as featureless as clay because of what i said when i went to the gods  in heaven, bringing calamity down on those whom now the sea engulfs and overwhelms,  my children who are now the children of fish.' the annunaki sat and wept with her,  the cowering gods wept, covering their mouths. six days and nights the storm went on this way,  the south wind flooding over the mountains and valleys until the seventh day when the storm birth labor  subsided at last, the flood subsided at last. i opened the hatch. the daylight touched my face.  i looked outside. nothing was moving at all. it looked as flat as a flat clay roof looks flat;  and all the human beings had turned to clay. i fell to my knees and wept. the tears ran down  the sides of my nose. i wept in the total silence. i looked outside and looked as far as i could,  trying to find, looking across the world, something. and then, far off, something was there.  what looked like signs of an island could faintly be seen; and then the boat was caught and held from under  by the peak rock of a mountain under the water. it was mount nisir the boat was grounded on.  a first day it was held, and a second day; a third day the boat was held from under,  and a fourth day, and a fifth; a sixth day, and then on the seventh day i freed a dove.  the dove flew free and flew away from the boat, seeking a place for its little feet to alight,  and finding none, flew back to the boat to perch. i freed a swallow then and it flew free  and flew away from the boat, seeking a place for its little feet to alight, and finding none,  flew back to the boat to find a place to alight. i freed a raven then and it flew free  and flew away from the boat, and never returned. it had found a place to alight, and circled about  the place, and alighted, and settled itself, and ate, and never after that returned to the boat.  then i set free all the other birds in the boat and they flew free, scattering to the winds.   iv  "i went ashore and offered a sacrifice. i poured out a libation; i set out seven  vessels of offerings on a stand, and then set seven more; i made a fire of wood  of myrtle, wood of cane, and wood of cedar. i lit the fire. the odor touched the nostrils  of the igigi gods and gave them pleasure. i slaughtered a sheep to make a sacrifice;  the gods collected like flies about the altar. the great goddess progenitrix ishtar  came down from heaven wearing about her neck the pendant anu gave her for her adornment,  of lapis lazuli ornately made. she said: 'just as this pendant never shall  forgotten be by the goddess, so the goddess never will forget calamitous days.  the gods may come to the ritual but forbidden is the presence of enlil, by whose command  the flood was peremptorily brought down on the heads of all my children, engulfing them.'  when the god enlil came to the sacrifice he saw the boat, and the sight filled him with rage.  he spoke in anger to the gathered gods: 'how is it that one man has saved himself?  no breath of life was meant to be kept safe from its obliteration in the flood.'  ninurta opened his mouth and said to the god: 'ea, the cleverest of the gods, deviser,  let ea speak and give enlil his answer.' then ea opened his mouth and said to the god:  "the punishment should always fit the crime. let him who has performed an evil act  be punished for that act. let not the flood be brought down on the heads of all for what  one man has done; and he who has transgressed, show pity to him, lest he be cut off  from all his fellows. better that a lion should come into the village and prey upon it,  taking a few, than that the flood drown all. better a wolf should find its ravening way  into the fold, devouring some, much better than that the flood turn all that breathes to clay.  better that famine starve a few of them than that a harvest of waters obliterate all.  better that erra the plague god, better that he take hold of some, seize them and bear them away  to the underworld, than that the flood drown all. i did not tell the secret to the man.  he listened to the wind and guessed the secret. let the gods sitting in council now decide  how to reward the wise man for his wisdom.' the god enlil then went on board the boat.  he took me by the hand and made me kneel; he took my wife by the hand and made her kneel.  the god then touched our foreheads, blessing us, and said: 'you were but human; now you are  admitted into the company of gods. your dwelling place shall be the faraway,  the place which is the source of the outflowing of all the rivers of the world there are.'  and so they led us to the faraway, the place we dwell in now, which is the source  of all the rivers flowing through the world." then scornful utnapishtim said to the king:  "tell me, who would bring all the gods together so that for you they might in council decide  what your deserving is, that you be granted admittance into the company of gods?  let there be now a test of gilgamesh. let him but keep himself awake for a week,  six nights and seven days, to show his worth." so gilgamesh sat down to begin the test.   v  almost as soon as gilgamesh the king sat down to test himself, a mist of sleep,  as ocean mist comes over the shore from the waters, came over his eyes, and so the strongest slept.  then utnapishtim spoke to his wife and said: "see how this hero sleeps who asks for life.  as ocean mist blows over the land from the waters, so the mist of sleep comes over the eyes of the king."  the wife of utnapishtim answered him: "touch and awaken him, so that he may  return in safety to his native city, entering through the gate of his departure."  but utnapishtim said: "man is deceitful. therefore he will deceive us. every day,  as he lies sleeping, you must bake a wafer and place the wafer near him, making a mark  upon the nearby wall for every day this hero sleeps who seeks eternal life."  she baked a wafer every day, of bread, for every day that gilgamesh lay sleeping.  the first wafer was dry as dust; the second only less so than the first; the third  was soggy and rotten; the fourth wafer was white in the crust; there were spots of mold on the fifth;  the sixth wafer looked almost as if it was fresh; and the seventh—gilgamesh started and waked up  as utnapishtim touched him on the forehead. gilgamesh said: "i had almost fallen asleep  when you reached out and touched me and kept me awake." but utnapishtim said to gilgamesh:  "look at the wafers and look at the marks on the wall: a mark and a wafer for every day you have slept.  the first wafer is dry as dust; the second is only less so than the first; the third  is soggy and rotten; the fourth wafer is white in the crust; there are spots of mold on the fifth;  the sixth wafer looks almost as if it is fresh; and the seventh—but it is then that you awoke."  then gilgamesh said to him: "what shall i do? who takes us away has taken hold of me.  death is in my chamber when i sleep; and death is there wherever i set foot."   vi  utnapishtim said to the boatman then: "though your delight has been to cross the waters,  the harbor now is closed, the crossing forbidden. the waters and the shore now shun the boatman.  the hairy-bodied man you brought across the perilous waters, wearing the skin of a beast  that hides his beauty, let urshànabi take him to the washing place. there let him wash his body,  washing away the filth that hides his beauty. manifest be the beauty of gilgamesh.  take the skin of a beast he wore on the journey and throw it away in the sea. let gilgamesh  bind up his shining hair with a new fillet. let him put on a spotless festal robe.  let him return to his native city in honor in the royal garments appropriate to himself."  the boatman led the king to the washing place. gilgamesh washed his body, washing away  the filth that obscured his beauty; then urshànabi took the skin of a beast and threw it away.  manifest was the beauty of gilgamesh. he bound up his shining hair with a new fillet;  he put on a festal robe, utterly spotless, a royal garment appropriate to himself.  then he and the boatman boarded the little boat and the boat began to move away from the shore.  but the wife of utnapishtim said to her husband: "this man has undergone a terrible journey.  what will you give him for his return to his city?" gilgamesh, hearing, took up his punting pole  and brought the little boat back to the shore. utnapishtim spoke and said to him:  "gilgamesh, you who have made the terrible journey, what shall i give you for your return to your city?"  then utnapishtim said to gilgamesh: "a secret of the gods i will disclose.  there is a plant that grows under the waters, thorny to seize, as a rose is thorny to seize.  how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man is the name of the plant that grows under the waters.  descend into the waters and seize the plant." so gilgamesh tied heavy stone weights to his feet  to bring him down through the waters of the abyss to the place where he could find the magic plant.  he seized the thorny plant that cut his hands; he cut the stone weights loose from his heavy feet;  and the waters cast him up upon the shore.   vii  gilgamesh said to urshànabi the boatman: "urshànabi, this plant is a wonderful plant.  new life may be obtained by means of it. i will carry the thorny plant back to my city.  i will give some of the plant to the elders there, to share among them, telling them it is called  how-the-old-man-once-again-becomes-a-young-man. and i will take my share of the magic plant,  once more to become the one who is youngest and strongest."   viii  at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat; at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night.  gilgamesh found a spring, a pool of pure water. he entered the water, to refresh himself.  in the reeds nearby a serpent of the place became aware of the fragrance of the plant,  breathed its perfume, desired it, and approached, and stole away with it among the reeds.  as it disappeared the serpent shed its skin. when gilgamesh found out what the serpent had done  he sat down weeping by the pool of water. he took urshànabi by the hand and said:  "what shall i do? the journey has gone for nothing. for whom has my heart's blood been spent? for whom?  for the serpent who has taken away the plant. i descended into the waters to find the plant  and what i found was a sign telling me to abandon the journey and what it was i sought for."   ix  at twenty leagues they stopped only to eat. at thirty leagues they stopped to rest for the night.  and so they traveled until they reached uruk. there gilgamesh the king said to the boatman:  "study the brickwork, study the fortification; climb the great ancient staircase to the terrace;  study how it is made; from the terrace see the planted and fallow fields, the ponds and orchards.  one league is the inner city, another league is orchards; still another the fields beyond;  over there is the precinct of the temple. three leagues and the temple precinct of ishtar  measure uruk, the city of gilgamesh."  
NEW POEM
 she came to see the bones whiten in a summer, and one year later a narrow mummy with a dusty skin and flaking scales would break apart in her hand.  she wanted to see if sunlight still glinted in those eyes, to know what it lighted from a window on the mallow roots, leaf mold and fallen casques.  and to ask if a single tongue, one forked flicker in the dark, had found any heat in death: in the closed space and chill of that burial, what speech, what sign would there be.  she who walked in the canyon early, parted the grass and halted upon the living snake, coiled and mottled by a bitter pool,  unearthed her jar in another spring, to find the snake spirit gone, only a little green water standing, some dust, or a smell.

 key west in the cubano diner, tiny cups of black, black coffee, hot and sweet, and chipped blue china plates of black beans and yellowtail, fished by the fishermen as the sun came up this morning.  yesterday out on the reef, we looked through the floor of the boat, through layers of clear, clean water— windows looking into other windows— down to the floor of the world, shallow, pliant, and shifting. there, schools of yellowtail swam through the living coral, bright as stained glass, cast into underwater constellations both strange and familiar: a flower, a brain, a cathedral. suddenly a shadow parted the school— as if a cloud had just blotted the sun— a barracuda swerving as they swerved, and nothing they could do. after it fed, the two halves joined, the missing ones unmourned, all as it was before.  if i could live for a thousand years, ten thousand, would ever i see the great family of men, women, and children, both preying and preyed-upon, swimming as freely as the yellowtail? would that be heaven or hell? each naked human face a candle joining other candles in a procession spanning many centuries, entering the cathedral of live stone whose heavy doors are cast with scenes from our own lives, moving as moving pictures move, until the reel runs out. in that world-without-end hour, will the future read us in relief, blindly touching each raised and burnished scene with fingertips, the ejaculate word forming on their lips, an o! and then again an o!  of terror and astonishment? o how will they sing knowing what they know? streaming through time, they see our approach, we are plotted in space, our light outlives our lives and sends a signal far into the future: the past is alive!  dead and dark for a long time, we are as stars to them, stars wishing to be wished on.

 for my grandmother, theresa frank some slow evenings when the light hangs late and stubborn in the sky, gives itself up to darkness slowly and deliberately, slow cloud after slow cloud, slowness enters me like something familiar, and it feels like going home.  it’s all there in the disappearing light: all the evenings of slow sky and slow loving, slow boats on sluggish bayous; the thick-middled trees with the slow-sounding names—oak, mimosa, pecan, magnolia; the slow tree sap that sticks in your hair when you lie with the trees; and the maple syrup and pancakes and grits, the butter melting slowly into and down the sides like sweat between breasts of sloe-eyed strippers; and the slow-throated blues that floats over the city like fog; and the weeping, the willows, the cut onions, the cayenne, the slow-cooking beans with marrow-thick gravy; and all the mint juleps drunk so slowly on all the slow southern porches, the bourbon and sugar and mint going down warm and brown, syrup and slow; and all the ice cubes melting in all the iced teas, all the slow-faced people sitting in all the slowly rocking rockers; and the crabs and the shrimp and crawfish, the hard shells slowly and deliberately and lovingly removed, the delicate flesh slowly sucked out of heads and legs and tails; and the slow lips that eat and drink and love and speak that slow luxurious language, savoring each word like a long-missed lover; and the slow-moving nuns, the black habits dragging the swollen ground; and the slow river that cradles it all, and the chicory coffee that cuts through it all, slow-boiled and black as dirt; and the slow dreams and the slow-healing wounds and the slow smoke of it all slipping out, ballooning into the sky—slow, deliberate, and magnificent.  
NEW POEM
 on the long shore, lit by the moon to show them properly alone, two lovers suddenly embraced so that their shadows were as one. the ordinary night was graced for them by the swift tide of blood that silently they took at flood, and for a little time they prized themselves emparadised.  then, as if shaken by stage-fright beneath the hard moon’s bony light, they stood together on the sand embarrassed in each other’s sight but still conspiring hand in hand, until they saw, there underfoot, as though the world had found them out, the goose fish turning up, though dead, his hugely grinning head.  there in the china light he lay, most ancient and corrupt and grey. they hesitated at his smile, wondering what it seemed to say to lovers who a little while before had thought to understand, by violence upon the sand, the only way that could be known to make a world their own.  it was a wide and moony grin together peaceful and obscene; they knew not what he would express, so finished a comedian he might mean failure or success, but took it for an emblem of their sudden, new and guilty love to be observed by, when they kissed, that rigid optimist.  so he became their patriarch, dreadfully mild in the half-dark. his throat that the sand seemed to choke, his picket teeth, these left their mark but never did explain the joke that so amused him, lying there while the moon went down to disappear along the still and tilted track that bears the zodiac.

 all life long you are unhanding unhanding and unhanding what was handed you.  all life long you throw out the line of life. you throw out the line, stinging up from your guts.  were they planting trees, your father and your mother? did they ever plant? is that a line of trees far away green line?  all life long you include something that includes your life. you are in the egg.  (                in the center of a picture, two angels hold a transparent crystal egg of teardrop shape. in the egg the ocean god is throned, left leg crossed over right, trident in right hand. under his outstretched arms two children or little people stand, a boy at his right, a girl at his left. the boy’s head is crowned with a sun, the girl’s, with a crescent moon.  that’s the middle level of the picture. at the top a blazing sun with human features dominates the vertical axis. at the bottom a man and a woman kneel on either side a furnace, man to the right of the furnace, woman to the left. in the furnace itself, directly below the egg containing the god, is suspended a similar egg, empty.                            )  all life long the dew falls from heaven all life long trees climb up from underground waters.   in the seed of the old god the new gods are swarming.  earth is ready for planting.  the shut eye is opening.  the heat.

 grown about by fragrant bushes, sunken in a winding valley, where the clear winds blow and the shadows come and go, and the cattle stand and low and the sheep bells and the linnets sing and tinkle musically. between the past and the future, those two black infinities between which our brief life flashes a moment and goes out.

 the unclean spirits cry out in the body or mind of the guest ellen in a loud voice torment me not, and in the fury of her unclean hands beating the air in some kind of unending torment— nobody witnessing could possibly know the event that cast upon her the spell of this enchantment.  almost all the guests are under some kind of enchantment: of being poor day after day in the same body; of being witness still to some obscene event; of listening all the time to somebody’s voice whispering in the ear things divine or unclean, in the quotidian of unending torment.  one has to keep thinking there was some source of torment, something that happened someplace else, unclean. one has to keep talking in a reasonable voice about things done, say, by a father’s body to or upon the body of ellen, in enchantment helpless, still by the unforgotten event  enchanted, still in the old forgotten event a prisoner of love, filthy ellen in her torment, guest ellen in the dining hall in her body, hands beating the air in her enchantment, sitting alone, gabbling in her garbled voice the narrative of the spirits of the unclean.  she is wholly the possessed one of the unclean. maybe the spirits came from the river. the enchantment entered her, maybe, in the northeast kingdom. the torment, a thing of the waters, gratuitous event, came up out of the waters and entered her body and lived in her in torment and cried out in her voice.  it speaks itself over and over again in her voice, cursing maybe or not a familiar obscene event or only the pure event of original enchantment from the birth of the river waters, the pure unclean rising from the source of things, in a figure of torment seeking out ellen, finding its home in her poor body.  her body witness is, so also is her voice, of torment coming from unknown event; unclean is the nature and name of the enchantment.

 “i have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.” —confucius dolorous, here he made his stand like those who are beaten, behind, the mountains, and in front, the sea, to the west a rock by the brown river eaten. here beauty went along the strand smashing green waves against the white sand.  “beyond the rock there, that’s his thatch.” so spoke up a neighbor. “and you’ll be finding leather string on latch and him inside, at peace from labor.”  so he was run in, the fox to his earth, he the old reaver, warm by his hearth, but where was the booty, the gems and doubloons filched from fat merchants by tropical moons? he, of all pirates prime hierophant, no swords, no silver, no silk of levant? “four things,” he answered, “of all things that are: a rock, a river, a tree and a star!” this is his wisdom? he welcomed me ill; i passed by the tree and strove up the hill. this is the saying of one wise as he? a river, a rock, a star and a tree?  this is the place, the shrine of the sage, who lived his last days with beauty for wage. here’s where the tree was long ago humbled, and a space points us out where granite has crumbled. the river is empty, and a wind sweeps the stones; the stars are not whiter than freebooter’s bones.  
NEW POEM
 the heat of autumn is different from the heat of summer. one ripens apples, the other turns them to cider. one is a dock you walk out on, the other the spine of a thin swimming horse and the river each day a full measure colder. a man with cancer leaves his wife for his lover. before he goes she straightens his belts in the closet, rearranges the socks and sweaters inside the dresser by color. that’s autumn heat: her hand placing silver buckles with silver, gold buckles with gold, setting each on the hook it belongs on in a closet soon to be empty, and calling it pleasure.  
NEW POEM
 here they are. the soft eyes open. if they have lived in a wood it is a wood. if they have lived on plains it is grass rolling under their feet forever.  having no souls, they have come, anyway, beyond their knowing. their instincts wholly bloom and they rise. the soft eyes open.  to match them, the landscape flowers, outdoing, desperately outdoing what is required: the richest wood, the deepest field.  for some of these, it could not be the place it is, without blood. these hunt, as they have done, but with claws and teeth grown perfect,  more deadly than they can believe. they stalk more silently, and crouch on the limbs of trees, and their descent upon the bright backs of their prey  may take years in a sovereign floating of joy. and those that are hunted know this as their life, their reward: to walk  under such trees in full knowledge of what is in glory above them, and to feel no fear, but acceptance, compliance. fulfilling themselves without pain  at the cycle’s center, they tremble, they walk under the tree, they fall, they are torn, they rise, they walk again.  
NEW POEM
 1  my soul radially whorls out to the edges of my body, according to the same laws by which stars shine, communicating with my body by emanation.  when you see her, you feel the impact of what visual can mean.  invisibility comes through of deep pink or a color i see clairvoyantly.  this felt sense at seeing the rose extends, because light in the dna of my cells receives light frequencies of the flower as a hologram.  the entire rose, petals in moving air, emotion of perfume records as a sphere, so when i recall the emotion, i touch dimensionality.  from a small bud emerges a tight wound bundle of babyskin coral petals, held in a half globe, as if by cupped hands.  then petals are innumerable, loose, double, sumptuous, unified.  i look through parted fingers to soften my gaze, so slow light shining off the object is filtered; then with feeling i look at swift color there.  it's swiftness that seems still as noon light, because my seeing travels at the same speed.  i make a reciprocal balance between light falling on the back of my eye to optic nerve to pineal gland, radiance stepping down to matter, and my future self opening out from this sight.  a moment extends to time passing as sense impression of a rose, including new joys where imagined roses, roses i haven't yet seen or seen in books record as my experience.  then experience is revelation, because plants and people have in their cells particles of light that can become coherent, that radiate out physically and also with the creativity of metaphor, as in a beam of light holographically, i.e., by intuition, in which i inhale the perfume of the bourbon rose, then try to separate what is scent, sense, and what you call memory, what is emotion, where in a dialogue like touching is it so vibratory and so absorbent of my attention and longing, with impressions like fingerprints all over.  i'm saying physical perception is the data of my embodiment, whereas for the rose, scarlet itself is matter.   2  the rose communicates instantly with the woman by sight, collapsing its boundaries, and the woman widens her boundaries.  her "rate of perception" slows down, because of its complexity.  there's a feeling of touching and being touched, the shadings of color she can sense from touch.  there's an affinity between awareness and blossom.  the rose symbolizes the light of this self-affinity.  i come to visit drooping white cabbage roses at dusk.  that corner of the garden glows with a quality of light i might see when light shines through mist or in early morning reflects off water.  i stand quietly and allow this quality to permeate air around me.  here, with a white rose, color is clairsentient, this color in the process of being expressed, like seeing venus in the day.  walking, i move in and out of negative space around which each rose is engaged and become uncertain of my physical extent as an object.  look at the energy between people and plants; your heart moves into depth perception; for depth, read speed of light.  i set my intention through this sense of moving into coherence with the bio-photons of a plant and generate feeling in response.  a space opens and awareness gathers it in, as at night my dream is colorless and weaves into the nuance.  i can intentionally engage with the coherence of light beams, instant as though lightless, or the colored light of a dimension not yet arrived, as our hearts are not outside affinity with respect to wavelength, shaping meaning, using the capacity for feeling to sense its potency in a rose and to cultivate inter-being with summer perfume.  
NEW POEM
 in the month of the long decline of roses i, beholding the summer dead before me, set my face to the sea and journeyed silent, gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions half divided the eyelids of the sunset; till i heard as it were a noise of waters moving tremulous under feet of angels multitudinous, out of all the heavens; knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage, shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow; and saw, trodden upon by noiseless angels, long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight, sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel, blown about by the lips of winds i knew not, winds not born in the north nor any quarter, winds not warm with the south nor any sunshine; heard between them a voice of exultation, "lo, the summer is dead, the sun is faded, even like as a leaf the year is withered, all the fruits of the day from all her branches gathered, neither is any left to gather. all the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms, all are taken away; the season wasted, like an ember among the fallen ashes. now with light of the winter days, with moonlight, light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost, we bring flowers that fade not after autumn, pale white chaplets and crowns of latter seasons, fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser), woven under the eyes of stars and planets when low light was upon the windy reaches where the flower of foam was blown, a lily dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows and green fields of the sea that make no pasture: since the winter begins, the weeping winter, all whose flowers are tears, and round his temples iron blossom of frost is bound for ever."  
NEW POEM
 soul and race are private dominions, memories and modal songs, a tenor blossoming, which would paint suffering a clear color but is not in this victorian house without oil in zero degree weather and a forty-mile-an-hour wind; it is all a well-knit family: a love supreme. oak leaves pile up on walkway and steps, catholic as apples in a special mist of clear white children who love my children. i play “alabama” on a warped record player skipping the scratches on your faces over the fibrous conical hairs of plastic under the wooden floors.  dreaming on a train from new york to philly, you hand out six notes which become an anthem to our memories of you: oak, birch, maple, apple, cocoa, rubber. for this reason martin is dead; for this reason malcolm is dead; for this reason coltrane is dead; in the eyes of my first son are the browns of these men and their music.

 oysters adhere to things, no eyes:  spat on the smooth curve of a pier  they feel shadows and snap shut.  the sun wavers while anchored below  each distills tomales bay,  accreting waves within its shell.  voluptuous and cold, kumamoto trembles  on a thin fork, liquefaction  of cloud. rain distorts glass,  our tavern submerged all afternoon.  
NEW POEM
 is this a holy thing to see, in a rich and fruitful land, babes reducd to misery, fed with cold and usurous hand?  is that trembling cry a song? can it be a song of joy? and so many children poor? it is a land of poverty!  and their sun does never shine. and their fields are bleak &amp; bare. and their ways are fill'd with thorns. it is eternal winter there.  for where-e'er the sun does shine, and where-e'er the rain does fall: babe can never hunger there, nor poverty the mind appall.  
NEW POEM
 the story goes from in a rainfall to sister walking a field browned autumn. and when she arrives winter has come, so the old man rises from his chair, picks up matches, pipes and tools, and walks out to begin again.  the sculptures grow by the day, birds in ice, recognizable eagles, a bear who began as a man in a moment of dance. he does this in ice, all winter carving at dawn, carving at dusk.  and sister after walking a field browned autumn, arrives, watches from the east window, waits, goes out to him in spring, taps him on the shoulder and points to the pools of water he's standing over.

 the river brought down dead horses, dead men and military debris, indicative of war or official acts upstream, but it went by, it all goes by, that is the thing about the river. then a soldier on a log went by. he seemed drunk and we asked him why had he and this junk come down to us so from the past upstream. “friends,” he said, “the great battle of granicus has just been won by all of the greeks except the lacedaemonians and myself: this is a joke between me and a man named alexander, whom all of you ba-bas will hear of as a god.”

 i am the woman, ark of the law and its breaker, who chastened her steps and taught her knees to be meek, bridled and bitted her heart and humbled her cheek, parcelled her will, and cried "take more!" to the taker, shunned what they told her to shun, sought what they bade her seek, locked up her mouth from scornful speaking: now it is open to speak.  i am she that is terribly fashioned, the creature wrought in god's perilous mood, in his unsafe hour. the morning star was mute, beholding my feature, seeing the rapture i was, the shame, and the power, scared at my manifold meaning; he heard me call "o fairest among ten thousand, acceptable brother!" and he answered not, for doubt; till he saw me crawl and whisper down to the secret worm, "o mother, be not wroth in the ancient house; thy daughter forgets not at all!" i am the woman, flëer away, soft withdrawer back from the maddened mate, lurer inward and down to the gates of day and crier there in the gate, "what shall i give for thee, wild one, say! the long, slow rapture and patient anguish of life, or art thou minded a swifter way? ask if thou canst, the gold, but oh if thou must,  good is the shining dross, lovely the dust! look at me, i am the woman, harlot and heavenly wife; tell me thy price, be unashamed; i will assuredly pay!"  i am also the mother: of two that i bore i comfort and feed the slayer, feed and comfort the slain. did they number my daughters and sons? i am mother of more! many a head they marked not, here in my bosom has lain, babbling with unborn lips in a tongue to be, far, incredible matters, all familiar to me. still would the man come whispering, "wife!" but many a time my breast took him not as a husband: i soothed him and laid him to rest even as the babe of my body, and knew him for such. my mouth is open to speak, that was dumb too much! i say to you i am the mother; and under the sword which flamed each way to harry us forth from the lord, i saw him young at the portal, weeping and staying the rod, and i, even i was his mother, and i yearned as the mother of god.  i am also the spirit. the sisters laughed when i sat with them dumb in the portals, over my lamp, half asleep in the doors: for my gown was raught off at the shoulder to shield from the wind and the rain the wick i tended against the mysterious hour when the silent city of being should ring with song, as the lord came in with life to the marriage bower. "look!" laughed the elder sisters; and crimson with shame i hid my breast away from the rosy flame. "ah!" cried the leaning sisters, pointing, doing me wrong, "do you see?" laughed the wanton sisters, "she will get her lover ere long!" and it was but a little while till unto my need he was given indeed, and we walked where waxing world after world went by; and i said to my lover, "let us begone, "oh, let us begone, and try "which of them all the fairest to dwell in is, "which is the place for us, our desirable clime!" but he said, "they are only the huts and the little villages, pleasant to go and lodge in rudely over the vintage—time!" scornfully spake he, being unwise, being flushed at heart because of our walking together. but i was mute with passionate prophecies; my heart went veiled and faint in the golden weather, while universe drifted by after still universe. then i cried, "alas, we must hasten and lodge therein, one after one, and in every star that they shed!  a dark and a weary thing is come on our head— to search obedience out in the bosom of sin, to listen deep for love when thunders the curse; for o my love, behold where the lord hath planted in every star in the midst his dangerous tree! still i must pluck thereof and bring unto thee, saying, "the coolness for which all night we have panted; taste of the goodly thing, i have tasted first!" bringing us noway coolness, but burning thirst, giving us noway peace, but implacable strife, loosing upon us the wounding joy and the wasting sorrow of life!  i am the woman, ark of the law and sacred arm to upbear it, heathen trumpet to overthrow and idolatrous sword to shear it: yea, she whose arm was round the neck of the morning star at song, is she who kneeleth now in the dust and cries at the secret door, "open to me, 0 sleeping mother! the gate is heavy and strong. "open to me, i am come at last; be wroth with thy child no more. "let me lie down with thee there in the dark, and be slothful with thee as before!"

 i expected something up out of the water not the shadow in the wave that rose  to fill the wave then splash a breath off the abutting air      then disappear.  i didn't see any of this         only the dark wave.         even the size of a whale  i don't see        what i look directly at. i didn't see the pronghorn antelope,  speed they pointed out equal our car's, but never having seen distance so large  i couldn't pin in it      point to antler and saw in parallax instead       the world  entire a still brown arc of leap      so like a first look at the milky way       each stone  a star i saw but could not see. i didn't see  the nazca earth drawings looking at a line like a path      the vision on it   my not looking up.  &amp; trying to see from on the ground looking from a plane thousands of feet above  maybe i saw only what the unenlightened marking out the lines could see from there  because i never saw the figures until shown from books.  i've told folk half the truth      that i was there i was but embarrassed      never told      i missed my chance  until i saw:       without embarrassment this country miss its chance   looking at color  and not see what it looked directly at, without embarrassment  act      and not see that done on its own hands      not see its own bright blood.

 when i am dead and over me bright april shakes out her rain-drenched hair, tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted, i shall not care.  i shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful when rain bends down the bough, and i shall be more silent and cold-hearted than you are now.  
NEW POEM
 1  i sing the body electric, the armies of those i love engirth me and i engirth them, they will not let me off till i go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.  was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves? and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? and if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? and if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?  2  the love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, that of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.  the expression of the face balks account, but the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, it is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, it is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, you linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.  the sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, the swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, the bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, the group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, the female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, the young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, the wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, the coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, the upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; the march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, the slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, the natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; such-like i love—i loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.  3  i knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, and in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.  this man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, the shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, these i used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, he was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, they and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, they did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, he drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, he was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, when he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, you would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.  4  i have perceiv’d that to be with those i like is enough, to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, to be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, to pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? i do not ask any more delight, i swim in it as in a sea.  there is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, all things please the soul, but these please the soul well.  5  this is the female form, a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, it attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, i am drawn by its breath as if i were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, undulating into the willing and yielding day, lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.  this the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, this the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.  be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, you are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.  the female contains all qualities and tempers them, she is in her place and moves with perfect balance, she is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, she is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.  as i see my soul reflected in nature, as i see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, see the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the female i see.  6  the male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, he too is all qualities, he is action and power, the flush of the known universe is in him, scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, the wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, the full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, (where else does he strike soundings except here?)  the man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, no matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, each has his or her place in the procession.  (all is a procession, the universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)  do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, for you only, and not for him and her?  7  a man’s body at auction, (for before the war i often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) i help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.  gentlemen look on this wonder, whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, for it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, for it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d.  in this head the all-baffling brain, in it and below it the makings of heroes.  examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, they shall be stript that you may see them.  exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, and wonders within there yet.  within there runs blood, the same old blood! the same red-running blood! there swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, (do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)  this is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, in him the start of populous states and rich republics, of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.  how do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? (who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)  8  a woman’s body at auction, she too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, she is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.  have you ever loved the body of a woman? have you ever loved the body of a man? do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?  if any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, and the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, and in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face.  have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? for they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.  9  o my body! i dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, i believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) i believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; all attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, the lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, the brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, the womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, the voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, the continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, the skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, the curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, the circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, the beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, the thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, the exquisite realization of health; o i say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, o i say now these are the soul!

 i walk’d the other day, to spend my hour, into a field, where i sometimes had seen the soil to yield a gallant flow’r; but winter now had ruffled all the bow’r and curious store i knew there heretofore.  yet i, whose search lov’d not to peep and peer i’ th’ face of things, thought with my self, there might be other springs besides this here, which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year; and so the flow’r might have some other bow’r.  then taking up what i could nearest spy, i digg’d about that place where i had seen him to grow out; and by and by i saw the warm recluse alone to lie, where fresh and green he liv’d of us unseen.  many a question intricate and rare did i there strow; but all i could extort was, that he now did there repair such losses as befell him in this air, and would ere long come forth most fair and young.  this past, i threw the clothes quite o’er his head; and stung with fear of my own frailty dropp’d down many a tear upon his bed; then sighing whisper’d, “happy are the dead! what peace doth now rock him asleep below!”  and yet, how few believe such doctrine springs from a poor root, which all the winter sleeps here under foot, and hath no wings to raise it to the truth and light of things; but is still trod by ev’ry wand’ring clod.  o thou! whose spirit did at first inflame and warm the dead, and by a sacred incubation fed with life this frame, which once had neither being, form, nor name; grant i may so thy steps track here below,  that in these masques and shadows i may see thy sacred way; and by those hid ascents climb to that day, which breaks from thee, who art in all things, though invisibly! shew me thy peace, thy mercy, love, and ease,  and from this care, where dreams and sorrows reign, lead me above, where light, joy, leisure, and true comforts move without all pain; there, hid in thee, shew me his life again, at whose dumb urn thus all the year i mourn.

 the irresistible and benevolent light brushes through the angel-wing begonias, the clippings of ruddy ears for the living room. intimate motes, debris of grounded, forlorn walks, speckle through the vitreous quality of blush. as fluid lulls turn like trout backs, azure-tipped fins oscillate in the shallows, the clear floating is dizziness.  tender events are meeting halves and wholes of affinity, the recurrence of whimsy and parallel streams flush away the blockage of malaise. incessant gratitude, pliable kindness smolders in the husk of these sweet accumulations: abalone shells, the thoughtful carvings from friends, the stone of another’s pocket, the photo of mystified moon over water, the smiles of worn chairs.  austere hopes find pleasure in lately cherished flowers. the blooms are articulate deluge, hues of delicacy. petals parted dim renderings, the viable imprint of the blood-hot beam of light with reformed courage. beveling the finish to suppression, the blade of choice brings the flourish of dividing while adequately doubling worth by two. multiplying. the luminescent burning of space. the heat is a domicile as abandoned as red roses budding their ascension from stem.  the sun has its own drum contenting itself with the rose heart it takes into continual rumbling. the connection of surface and hand. the great head of dark clouds finds its own place of unraveled repercussions and disruption, elsewhere, over the tall, staunch mountains of indemnity.

 like the stamen inside a flower the steeple stands in lovely blue and the day unfolds around its needle;  the flock of swallows that circles the steeple flies there each day through the same blue air that carries their cries from me to you;  we know how high the sun is now as long as the roof of the steeple glows, the roof that’s covered with sheets of tin;  up there in the wind, where the wind is not turning the vane of the weathercock, the weathercock silently crows in the wind.

 calm is the morn without a sound, calm as to suit a calmer grief, and only thro' the faded leaf the chestnut pattering to the ground:  calm and deep peace on this high wold, and on these dews that drench the furze. and all the silvery gossamers that twinkle into green and gold:  calm and still light on yon great plain that sweeps with all its autumn bowers, and crowded farms and lessening towers, to mingle with the bounding main:  calm and deep peace in this wide air, these leaves that redden to the fall; and in my heart, if calm at all, if any calm, a calm despair:  calm on the seas, and silver sleep, and waves that sway themselves in rest, and dead calm in that noble breast which heaves but with the heaving deep.

 risest thou thus, dim dawn, again, and howlest, issuing out of night, with blasts that blow the poplar white, and lash with storm the streaming pane?  day, when my crown'd estate begun to pine in that reverse of doom, which sicken'd every living bloom, and blurr'd the splendour of the sun;  who usherest in the dolorous hour with thy quick tears that make the rose pull sideways, and the daisy close her crimson fringes to the shower;  who might'st have heaved a windless flame up the deep east, or, whispering, play'd a chequer-work of beam and shade along the hills, yet look'd the same.  as wan, as chill, as wild as now; day, mark'd as with some hideous crime, when the dark hand struck down thro' time, and cancell'd nature's best: but thou,  lift as thou may'st thy burthen'd brows thro' clouds that drench the morning star, and whirl the ungarner'd sheaf afar, and sow the sky with flying boughs,  and up thy vault with roaring sound climb thy thick noon, disastrous day; touch thy dull goal of joyless gray, and hide thy shame beneath the ground.

 i will grieve alone, as i strolled alone, years ago, down along the ohio shore. i hid in the hobo jungle weeds upstream from the sewer main, pondering, gazing.  i saw, down river, at twenty-third and water streets by the vinegar works, the doors open in early evening. swinging their purses, the women poured down the long street to the river and into the river.  i do not know how it was they could drown every evening. what time near dawn did they climb up the other shore, drying their wings?  for the river at wheeling, west virginia, has only two shores: the one in hell, the other in bridgeport, ohio.  and nobody would commit suicide, only to find beyond death bridgeport, ohio.

 i stared into the valley: it was gone— wholly submerged! a vast flat sea remained, gray, with no waves, no beaches; all was one.  and here and there i noticed, when i strained, the alien clamoring of small, wild voices: birds that had lost their way in that vain land.  and high above, the skeletons of beeches, as if suspended, and the reveries of ruins and of the hermit’s hidden reaches.  and a dog yelped and yelped, as if in fear, i knew not where nor why. perhaps he heard strange footsteps, neither far away nor near—  echoing footsteps, neither slow nor quick, alternating, eternal. down i stared, but i saw nothing, no one, looking back.  the reveries of ruins asked: “will no one come?” the skeletons of trees inquired: “and who are you, forever on the go?”  i may have seen a shadow then, an errant shadow, bearing a bundle on its head. i saw—and no more saw, in the same instant.  all i could hear were the uneasy screeches of the lost birds, the yelping of the stray, and, on that sea that lacked both waves and beaches,  the footsteps, neither near nor far away.

 i remember a house where all were good to me, god knows, deserving no such thing: comforting smell breathed at very entering, fetched fresh, as i suppose, off some sweet wood. that cordial air made those kind people a hood all over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing will, or mild nights the new morsels of spring: why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should.  lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, all the air things wear that build this world of wales; only the inmate does not correspond: god, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales, complete thy creature dear o where it fails, being mighty a master, being a father and fond.

 at four o’clock it’s dark. today, looking out through dusk at three gray women in stretch slacks chatting in front of the post office, their steps left and right and back like some quick folk dance of kindness, i remembered the winter we spent crying in each other’s laps. what could you be thinking at this moment? how lovely and strange the gangly spines of trees against a thickening sky as you drive from the library humming off-key? or are you smiling at an idea met in a book the way you smiled with your whole body the first night we talked? i was so sure my love of you was perfect, and the light today reminded me of the winter you drove home each day in the dark at four o’clock and would come into my study to kiss me despite mistake after mistake after mistake.

 wisdom and spirit of the universe! thou soul, that art the eternity of thought! and giv'st to forms and images a breath and everlasting motion! not in vain, by day or star-light, thus from my first dawn of childhood didst thou intertwine for me the passions that build up our human soul; not with the mean and vulgar works of man; but with high objects, with enduring things, with life and nature; purifying thus the elements of feeling and of thought, and sanctifying by such discipline both pain and fear,—until we recognise a grandeur in the beatings of the heart.  nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me with stinted kindness. in november days, when vapours rolling down the valleys made a lonely scene more lonesome; among woods at noon; and 'mid the calm of summer nights, when, by the margin of the trembling lake, beneath the gloomy hills, homeward i went in solitude, such intercourse was mine: mine was it in the fields both day and night, and by the waters, all the summer long. and in the frosty season, when the sun was set, and, visible for many a mile, the cottage-windows through the twilight blazed, i heeded not the summons: happy time it was indeed for all of us; for me it was a time of rapture! clear and loud the village-clock tolled six—i wheeled about, proud and exulting like an untired horse that cares not for his home.—all shod with steel we hissed along the polished ice, in games confederate, imitative of the chase and woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn, the pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare. so through the darkness and the cold we flew, and not a voice was idle; with the din smitten, the precipices rang aloud; the leafless trees and every icy crag tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars, eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west the orange sky of evening died away.  not seldom from the uproar i retired into a silent bay, or sportively glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, to cut across the reflex of a star; image, that, flying still before me, gleamed upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, when we had given our bodies to the wind, and all the shadowy banks on either side came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still the rapid line of motion, then at once have i, reclining back upon my heels, stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled with visible motion her diurnal round! behind me did they stretch in solemn train, feebler and feebler, and i stood and watched till all was tranquil as a summer sea.

 based on photographs from rural japan: radiance of the ordinary  /afloat  two boats with no riders still moving on water the hulls barely touching each with a single oar safely propped so it won’t fall    /lotus leaves  close into themselves at night  on their wide folded backs water beads  inside, their sleeping flowers    /inside  do the carp just below the water’s stillness see the pines    /fall daikon  just pulled from the soil these pungent roots hang from bamboo poles their white tubed bodies bend as if slightly aroused  each ripe radish will be drenched in salt then eaten raw all winter    /lone pine  ancient tree with so many tongues  how long this throated stem this stillness before rain

 inside my head   inside my head a common room, a common place, a common tune, a common wealth, a common doom  inside my head. i close my eyes. the horses run. vast are the skies, and blue my passing thoughts’ surprise  inside my head. what is this space here found to be, what is this place if only me? inside my head, whose face?   the tools   first there, it proves to be still here. distant as seen, it comes then to be near. i found it here and there unclear.  what if my hand had only been extension of an outside reaching in to work with common means to change me then?  all things are matter, yet these seem caught in the impatience of a dream, locked in the awkwardness they mean.   the swan   peculiar that swan should mean a sound? i’d thought of gods and power, and wounds. but here in the curious quiet this one has settled down.  all day the barking dogs were kept at bay. better than dogs, a single swan, they say, will keep all such malignant force away  and so preserve a calm, make pond a swelling lake— sound through the silent grove a shattering spate of resonances, jarring the mind awake.   the rose   into one’s self come in again, here as if ever now to once again begin with beauty’s old, old problem never-ending—  go, lovely rose ... so was that story told in some extraordinary place then,once upon a time so old it seems an echo now as it again unfolds.  i point to me to look out at the world. i see the white, white petals of this rose unfold. i know such beauty in the world grows cold.   the skull   “come closer. now there is nothing left either inside or out to gainsay death,” the skull that keeps its secrets saith.  the ways one went, the forms that were empty as wind and yet they stirred the heart to its passion, all is passed over.  lighten the load. close the eyes. let the mind loosen, the body die, the bird fly off to the opening sky.   the star   such space it comes again to be, a room of such vast possibility, a depth so great, a way so free.  life and its person, thinking to find a company wherewith to keep the time a peaceful passage, a constant rhyme,  stumble perforce, must lose their way, know that they go too far to stay stars in the sky, children at play.  
NEW POEM
 late summer, late afternoon, my work interrupted by bees who claim my tea, even my pen looks flower-good to them. i warn a delivery man that my bees, who all summer have been tame as cows, now grow frantic, aggressive, difficult to shoo from the house. i blame the second blooms come out in hot colors, defiant vibrancy— unexpected from cottage cosmos, nicotianna, and bean vine. but those bees know, i’m told by the interested delivery man, they have only so many days to go. he sighs at sweetness untasted.  still warm in the day, we inspect the bees. this kind stranger knows them in intimate detail. he can name the ones i think of as shopping ladies. their fur coats ruffed up, yellow packages tucked beneath their wings, so weighted with their finds they ascend in slow circles, sometimes drop, while other bees whirl madly, dance the blossoms, ravish broadly so the whole bed bends and bounces alive.  he asks if i have kids, i say not yet. he has five, all boys. he calls the honeybees his girls although he tells me they’re ungendered workers who never produce offspring. some hour drops, the bees shut off. in the long, cool slant of sun, spent flowers fold into cups. he asks me if i’ve ever seen a solitary bee where it sleeps. i say i’ve not. the nearest bud’s a long-throated peach hollyhock. he cradles it in his palm, holds it up so i spy the intimacy of the sleeping bee. little life safe in a petal, little girl, your few furious buzzings as you stir stay with me all winter, remind me of my work undone.

 we must stop bragging. there are limits for us to the cold and the twelfth night  marks them all. just off the coast of maine the lobster boats pass, dragging their nets.  capsize once in a while, in water like that you die, that’s all, that water  isn’t even frozen. not even frozen, and that’s as cold as it gets.  the hearts of birds beat voraciously so they keep warm, so if you put out  a feeder, keep it full of the seeds their hearts feed on, then it is only  when their food runs out that you find them inexpressibly taut in hollows,  and that’s as cold as it ever gets.  
NEW POEM
 the gods do not interest him, nor their debris, nor their terrible storms: he already knows how a body is made to glow, precursor to neon lights —  how hunger is hereditary. sons should not be haunted except by the dead, and his father is sober now, accepts tribute in silence and coca-cola.  he is thankful for strong knees, for momentum that lives in the mouth and the hands.  here is the fish with the filigree scales, here is the pot of rice — here, here: the grain of rice that makes the bowl a bowl. tuna’s blood hardening in the water. here is the night through which he runs, realizing the floor has turned to tissue paper, tearing into morning. no, the gods  do not compel him: he cannot bear the sight of the sun, an open sore — prefers the colors of its setting, how they reflect the ocean’s currents, always giving rise to something new or something he has forgotten.  the sky as a table, mounds of rice glazed with soy, gleaming like a display of mackerel, like snow general upon the island’s winter spine. days parade in their uniform; hearts attack, close  markets, open new ones. he teaches his sons to gut fish, does not despair his own hands’ speed: salt bandaging a cut, memory fraying at the edges. reaching, always — the top of the ladder, buried in light —  
NEW POEM
 i was birthed restless and elsewhere  gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning, slush, broke through with branches, steel  i was bitch-monikered, hipped, i hefted a whip rain, a swirling sheet of grit.  scraping toward the first of you, hungering for wood, walls, unturned skin. with shifting and frantic mouth, i loudly loved the slow bones  of elders, fools, and willows.

 —shored by trees at its far ending, as is the way in moral tales:  whether trees as trees actually, for their shadow and what inside of it  hides, threatens, calls to; or as ever-wavering conscience, cloaked now, and called chorus;  or, between these, whatever falls upon the rippling and measurable, but none to measure it, thin  fabric of this stands for. a kind of meadow, and then trees—many, assembled, a wood  therefore. through the wood the worn path, emblematic of much  trespass:halt. who goes there? a kind of meadow, where it ends begin trees, from whose twinning  of late light and the already underway darkness you were expecting perhaps the stag to step forward, to make  of its twelve-pointed antlers the branching foreground to a backdrop all branches;  or you wanted the usual bird to break cover at that angle at which wings catch entirely  what light’s left, so that for once the bird isn’t miracle at all, but the simplicity of patience  and a good hand assembling: first the thin bones, now in careful rows the feathers, like fretwork,  now the brush, for the laying-on of sheen....as is always the way, you tell yourself,in  poems—yes, always, until you have gone there, and gone there, “into the  field,” vowing only until there’s nothing more i want— thinking it, wrongly,  a thing attainable, any real end to wanting, and that it is close, and that it is likely, how will you not  this time catch hold of it: flashing, flesh at once  lit and lightless, a way out, the one dappled way, back—

 over our heads, trailing a wake of air and an enormous shadow as it passed, the falcon glided to its trainer’s fist and settled like a loaded weapon there.  then, while she fed the bird bit after bit of... what? rabbit? the trainer gave her talk: these birds, she said, prey on the small and weak, adding for the children’s benefit  that this, though it seems cruel, is really good since otherwise the other rabbits, mice, squirrels, what have you, would run out of space and die of illness or a lack of food.  i know what she was trying to get across, and i don’t doubt it would be healthier if we were more familiar than we are with how the natural world draws life from loss;  and granted, nothing is more natural than death incarnate falling from the sky; and granted, it is better some should die, however agonizingly, than all.  still, to teach children this is how things go is one thing, to insist that it is good is something else—it is to make a god of an unsatisfactory status quo,  this vicious circle that the clock hands draw and quarter, while the serpent bites its tail, or eats the dust, or strikes at someone’s heel, or winds up comprehended by a claw.  she launched the bird again. we watched it climb out of the amphitheatre, headed toward the darkened spires of a nearby wood, then bank, then angle toward us one last time.  
NEW POEM
 hence loathed melancholy, of cerberus, and blackest midnight born, in stygian cave forlorn, 'mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy; find out some uncouth cell, where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings, and the night-raven sings; there under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks, as ragged as thy locks, in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell. but come thou goddess fair and free, in heav'n yclep'd euphrosyne, and by men, heart-easing mirth, whom lovely venus at a birth with two sister graces more to ivy-crowned bacchus bore; or whether (as some sager sing) the frolic wind that breathes the spring, zephyr, with aurora playing, as he met her once a-maying, there on beds of violets blue, and fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew, fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair, so buxom, blithe, and debonair. haste thee nymph, and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity, quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, such as hang on hebe's cheek, and love to live in dimple sleek; sport that wrinkled care derides, and laughter holding both his sides. come, and trip it as ye go on the light fantastic toe, and in thy right hand lead with thee, the mountain-nymph, sweet liberty; and if i give thee honour due, mirth, admit me of thy crew to live with her, and live with thee, in unreproved pleasures free; to hear the lark begin his flight, and singing startle the dull night, from his watch-tower in the skies, till the dappled dawn doth rise; then to come in spite of sorrow, and at my window bid good-morrow, through the sweet-briar, or the vine, or the twisted eglantine; while the cock with lively din, scatters the rear of darkness thin, and to the stack, or the barn door, stoutly struts his dames before; oft list'ning how the hounds and horn cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, from the side of some hoar hill, through the high wood echoing shrill. sometime walking, not unseen, by hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, right against the eastern gate, where the great sun begins his state, rob'd in flames, and amber light, the clouds in thousand liveries dight. while the ploughman near at hand, whistles o'er the furrow'd land, and the milkmaid singeth blithe, and the mower whets his scythe, and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale. straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures whilst the landskip round it measures, russet lawns, and fallows gray, where the nibbling flocks do stray; mountains on whose barren breast the labouring clouds do often rest; meadows trim with daisies pied, shallow brooks, and rivers wide. towers, and battlements it sees bosom'd high in tufted trees, where perhaps some beauty lies, the cynosure of neighbouring eyes. hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, from betwixt two aged oaks, where corydon and thyrsis met, are at their savoury dinner set of herbs, and other country messes, which the neat-handed phyllis dresses; and then in haste her bow'r she leaves, with thestylis to bind the sheaves; or if the earlier season lead to the tann'd haycock in the mead. sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite, when the merry bells ring round, and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth, and many a maid, dancing in the chequer'd shade; and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday, till the live-long daylight fail; then to the spicy nut-brown ale, with stories told of many a feat, how faery mab the junkets eat, she was pinch'd and pull'd she said, and he by friar's lanthorn led, tells how the drudging goblin sweat, to earn his cream-bowl duly set, when in one night, ere glimpse of morn, his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn that ten day-labourers could not end; then lies him down, the lubber fiend, and stretch'd out all the chimney's length, basks at the fire his hairy strength; and crop-full out of doors he flings, ere the first cock his matin rings. thus done the tales, to bed they creep, by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. tower'd cities please us then, and the busy hum of men, where throngs of knights and barons bold, in weeds of peace high triumphs hold, with store of ladies, whose bright eyes rain influence, and judge the prize of wit, or arms, while both contend to win her grace, whom all commend. there let hymen oft appear in saffron robe, with taper clear, and pomp, and feast, and revelry, with mask, and antique pageantry; such sights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream. then to the well-trod stage anon, if jonson's learned sock be on, or sweetest shakespeare, fancy's child, warble his native wood-notes wild. and ever against eating cares, lap me in soft lydian airs, married to immortal verse, such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out, with wanton heed, and giddy cunning, the melting voice through mazes running, untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony; that orpheus' self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heap'd elysian flow'rs, and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto, to have quite set free his half-regain'd eurydice. these delights if thou canst give, mirth, with thee i mean to live.  
NEW POEM
 the western waves of ebbing day rolled o’er the glen their level way; each purple peak, each flinty spire, was bathed in floods of living fire. but not a setting beam could glow within the dark ravines below, where twined the path in shadow hid, round many a rocky pyramid, shooting abruptly from the dell its thunder-splintered pinnacle; round many an insulated mass, the native bulwarks of the pass, huge as the tower which builders vain presumptuous piled on shinar’s plain. the rocky summits, split and rent, formed turret, dome, or battlement, or seemed fantastically set with cupola or minaret, wild crests as pagod ever decked, or mosque of eastern architect. nor were these earth-born castles bare, nor lacked they many a banner fair; for, from their shivered brows displayed, far o’er the unfathomable glade, all twinkling with the dewdrop sheen, the brier-rose fell in streamers green, and creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, waved in the west-wind’s summer sighs.  boon nature scattered, free and wild, each plant or flower, the mountain’s child. here eglantine embalmed the air, hawthorn and hazel mingled there; the primrose pale, and violet flower, found in each cliff a narrow bower; fox-glove and night-shade, side by side, emblems of punishment and pride, grouped their dark hues with every stain the weather-beaten crags retain. with boughs that quaked at every breath, gray birch and aspen wept beneath; aloft, the ash and warrior oak cast anchor in the rifted rock; and, higher yet, the pine-tree hung his shattered trunk, and frequent flung, where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, his boughs athwart the narrowed sky. highest of all, where white peaks glanced, where glist’ning streamers waved and danced, the wanderer’s eye could barely view the summer heaven’s delicious blue; so wondrous wild, the whole might seem the scenery of a fairy dream.  onward, amid the copse ’gan peep a narrow inlet, still and deep, affording scarce such breadth of brim as served the wild duck’s brood to swim. lost for a space, through thickets veering, but broader when again appearing, tall rocks and tufted knolls their face could on the dark-blue mirror trace; and farther as the hunter strayed, still broader sweep its channels made. the shaggy mounds no longer stood, emerging from entangled wood, but, wave-encircled, seemed to float, like castle girdled with its moat; yet broader floods extending still divide them from their parent hill, till each, retiring, claims to be an islet in an inland sea.  and now, to issue from the glen, no pathway meets the wanderer’s ken, unless he climb, with footing nice a far projecting precipice. the broom’s tough roots his ladder made, the hazel saplings lent their aid; and thus an airy point he won, where, gleaming with the setting sun, one burnished sheet of living gold, loch katrine lay beneath him rolled, in all her length far winding lay, with promontory, creek, and bay, and islands that, empurpled bright, floated amid the livelier light, and mountains, that like giants stand, to sentinel enchanted land. high on the south, huge benvenue down to the lake in masses threw crags, knolls, and mountains, confusedly hurled, the fragments of an earlier world; a wildering forest feathered o’er his ruined sides and summit hoar, while on the north, through middle air, ben-an heaved high his forehead bare.

 i will arise and go now, and go to innisfree, and a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made; nine bean-rows will i have there, a hive for the honey-bee, and live alone in the bee-loud glade.  and i shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow, dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings; there midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, and evening full of the linnet’s wings.  i will arise and go now, for always night and day i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore; while i stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey, i hear it in the deep heart’s core.

 and what about this boulder, knocked off the moutaintop and tumbled down a thousand years ago  to lodge against the streambank, does it waste itself with worry about how things are going  to turn out? does the current slicing around it stop itself mid- stream because it can't get past  all it's left behind back at the source or up in the clouds where its waters first fell  to earth? and these trees, would they double over and clutch themselves or lash out  furiously if they were to discover what the other trees really thought of them? would the wind  reascend into the sky forever, like an in-drawn breath, if it knew it was fated simply  to sweep the earth of windlessness, to touch everything and keep nothing and be beheld by no one?

 before the moths have even appeared to orbit around them, the streetlamps come on, a long row of them glowing uselessly  along the ring of garden that circles the city center, where your steps count down the dulling of daylight. at your feet, a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding.  summer specializes in time, slows it down almost to dream. and the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle  mutter in disbelief:everything in the world is being thrown away! summer lingers, but it’s about ending. it’s about how things redden and ripen and burst and come down. it’s when  city workers cut down trees, demolishing one limb at a time, spilling the crumbs of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street.  sunglasses! the man softly exclaims while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons huddled around a dropped piece of bread.

 it is a tragedy, yes, but a confusing one. what happened to the wrestlers and where have they gone? loulou the pomeranian would love to know. outdoors the hills are buried in snow, but inside a rose, a rose full-blown, a roomful of rose. the bloom and its shadow overtaking the space. the bloom proposing an impossible tomb. of the tachists, the master said to his friend harry, “they paint white on white, and they believe that this is an achievement.” harry said,  “i dare you to paint a white rose in a white room with a window looking onto a landscape covered with snow.” now this — which even loulou, color-blindish, can tell is red — is the master’s grandiose response to an intoxicating challenge. synesthetically, the rose fills loulou’s pom ears with the echoes of torch songs, longing for the wrong. loulou is practically drunk from the smell: a heady pink, and juicy, and almost obscene. like crushed up candies, lingering and sweet, but with an adult musk at the core: a powerful flower. in looking, loulou’s heart becomes a house at dusk about to force  something to happen.

 after the birthing of bombs of forks and fear the frantic automatic weapons unleashed, the spray of bullets into a crowd holding hands, that brute sky opening in a slate metal maw that swallows only the unsayable in each of us, what’s left? even the hidden nowhere river is poisoned orange and acidic by a coal mine. how can you not fear humanity, want to lick the creek bottom dry, to suck the deadly water up into your own lungs, like venom? reader, i want to say:don’t die. even when silvery fish after fish comes back belly up, and the country plummets into a crepitating crater of hatred, isn’t there still something singing? the truth is: i don’t know. but sometimes, i swear i hear it, the wound closing like a rusted-over garage door, and i can still move my living limbs into the world without too much pain, can still marvel at how the dog runs straight toward the pickup trucks break-necking down the road, because she thinks she loves them, because she’s sure, without a doubt, that the loud roaring things will love her back, her soft small self alive with desire to share her goddamn enthusiasm, until i yank the leash back to save her because i want her to survive forever.don’t die, i say, and we decide to walk for a bit longer, starlings high and fevered above us, winter coming to lay her cold corpse down upon this little plot of earth. perhaps we are always hurtling our body towards the thing that will obliterate us, begging for love from the speeding passage of time, and so maybe, like the dog obedient at my heels, we can walk together peacefully, at least until the next truck comes.

 wahiawa is still a red dirt town where the sticky smell of pineapples being lopped off in the low-lying fields rises to mix with the minty leaves of eucalyptus in the bordering gulch.  we lived there near the edge where the orchids grew huge as lanterns overnight and the passion fruits rotted on the vines before they could be picked.  we grew there in the steady rain that fell like a gray curtain through which my mother peered: patches of depression. she kept the children under cover. we built houses within houses, stripping our parents’ bed of pillows and sheets, erecting walls out of the national geographic which my father had subscribed to for years. we feasted on those pictures of the world, while the mud oozed past the windows knocking over the drab green leaves of palm fronds as we ate our spinach. the mildew grew in rings around the sink where centipedes came swimming up the pipes on multiple feet and the mold grew around our small fingers making everything slippery to touch. we were squeamish and pale.  i remember one night my sister screamed. all the lights blinked on in the house. in the sudden brightness, we rushed to her room and found her crumpled in the far corner of the bed, her nightgown twisted in a strange shape; her eyes were as huge as mine, staring into the eyes of the bat that clung to the screen. its rodent fingers finally letting go as my father jabbed its furry body with the end of a broom.

 new houses relax on the fields. garage doors open soundlessly to admit the monster. tires stretched over forty pounds of air pressure float across gravel.  the boy closes the last storm door on the last evening paper and runs to the car where his mother waits. she does not answer him; the door slam freezes her dreams. it is january.  a dog chained to a barn door keeps barking. somebody’s angry, scared to let him go. on the other side of a forest past these fields, wolves sniff the hard snow of the tundra. i lay beside the only tree for warmth, there where the pack might find me.  the house takes care of us now. look at the meat browning under the light. the refrigerator switches on; ice crashes into the tray.  here are locks in case someone wants to do us harm. remember how the police had to pound and pound to wake us that night a white cadillac leapt from the icy road  into the arms of our maple! it hung there, empty, doors flung wide— it was a great white petal of a car, breathing under the gas-lights, opening and opening.

 once, we were coming back from a fête votive in goudargues when, sticky with pink barbe à papa, and queasy because the hairpinning road through st marcel de careiret resembled the crazy-maze passage of our caroming bumper car, we were met by a stream of sangliers— wild boars — dashing across the d9 near the forêt de cavillargues.  they pelted in a single ribbon, as i recall, so how could we even tell what they were, how distinguish that ruche of  shadow and wind from any other ghost of  the district?  that year i came across a theory about the suffix –argues that trails behind village names all around here. (vallérargues, st andré d’olérargues, goussargues, foussargues.) it may refer to an area of  land given to roman soldiers after service in north africa by the praetor in nîmes. cavillargues. the acres of cavillus, perhaps.  the hairy pigs had emigrated, perhaps from the caucasus, and no doubt had settled the val de tave long before cavillus arrived to begin gentrification. he wandered from the marble steps of the maison carrée, perhaps having paid obeisance to roman gods and governors, perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk, and les sangliers came out to give him a thrill, and to tell him  that this is not yet the forêt de cavillargues  you can’t run through it as if you were a ground-level mistral  with your feet like bound clumps of asparagus  and your eyes on the perseid meteor showers  all roads lead to rome except ours

 five years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters! and again i hear these waters, rolling from their mountain-springs with a soft inland murmur.—once again do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs, that on a wild secluded scene impress thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky. the day is come when i again repose here, under this dark sycamore, and view these plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, which at this season, with their unripe fruits, are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves 'mid groves and copses. once again i see these hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke sent up, in silence, from among the trees! with some uncertain notice, as might seem of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire the hermit sits alone.  these beauteous forms, through a long absence, have not been to me as is a landscape to a blind man's eye: but oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din of towns and cities, i have owed to them, in hours of weariness, sensations sweet, felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; and passing even into my purer mind with tranquil restoration:—feelings too of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, as have no slight or trivial influence on that best portion of a good man's life, his little, nameless, unremembered, acts of kindness and of love. nor less, i trust, to them i may have owed another gift, of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, in which the burthen of the mystery, in which the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world, is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, in which the affections gently lead us on,— until, the breath of this corporeal frame and even the motion of our human blood almost suspended, we are laid asleep in body, and become a living soul: while with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things.  if this be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft— in darkness and amid the many shapes of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir unprofitable, and the fever of the world, have hung upon the beatings of my heart— how oft, in spirit, have i turned to thee, o sylvan wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods, how often has my spirit turned to thee!  and now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, with many recognitions dim and faint, and somewhat of a sad perplexity, the picture of the mind revives again: while here i stand, not only with the sense of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts that in this moment there is life and food for future years. and so i dare to hope, though changed, no doubt, from what i was when first i came among these hills; when like a roe i bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, wherever nature led: more like a man flying from something that he dreads, than one who sought the thing he loved. for nature then (the coarser pleasures of my boyish days and their glad animal movements all gone by) to me was all in all.—i cannot paint what then i was. the sounding cataract haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, their colours and their forms, were then to me an appetite; a feeling and a love, that had no need of a remoter charm, by thought supplied, not any interest unborrowed from the eye.—that time is past, and all its aching joys are now no more, and all its dizzy raptures. not for this faint i, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts have followed; for such loss, i would believe, abundant recompense. for i have learned to look on nature, not as in the hour of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes the still sad music of humanity, nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power to chasten and subdue.—and i have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused, whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, and the round ocean and the living air, and the blue sky, and in the mind of man: a motion and a spirit, that impels all thinking things, all objects of all thought, and rolls through all things. therefore am i still a lover of the meadows and the woods and mountains; and of all that we behold from this green earth; of all the mighty world of eye, and ear,—both what they half create, and what perceive; well pleased to recognise in nature and the language of the sense the anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, the guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul of all my moral being.  nor perchance, if i were not thus taught, should i the more suffer my genial spirits to decay: for thou art with me here upon the banks of this fair river; thou my dearest friend, my dear, dear friend; and in thy voice i catch the language of my former heart, and read my former pleasures in the shooting lights of thy wild eyes. oh! yet a little while may i behold in thee what i was once, my dear, dear sister! and this prayer i make, knowing that nature never did betray the heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege, through all the years of this our life, to lead from joy to joy: for she can so inform the mind that is within us, so impress with quietness and beauty, and so feed with lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all the dreary intercourse of daily life, shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb our cheerful faith, that all which we behold is full of blessings. therefore let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk; and let the misty mountain-winds be free to blow against thee: and, in after years, when these wild ecstasies shall be matured into a sober pleasure; when thy mind shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, thy memory be as a dwelling-place for all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, if solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts of tender joy wilt thou remember me, and these my exhortations! nor, perchance— if i should be where i no more can hear thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams of past existence—wilt thou then forget that on the banks of this delightful stream we stood together; and that i, so long a worshipper of nature, hither came unwearied in that service: rather say with warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal of holier love. nor wilt thou then forget, that after many wanderings, many years of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, and this green pastoral landscape, were to me more dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

 1  against the low, new york state mountain background, a smokestack sticks up and gives out its snakelike wisp. thin, stripped win- ter birches pick up the vertical lines. last night we five watched the white, painted upright bars of steel in an ancient, new york jail called herkimer (named for a general who lost an arm). cops threw us against the car. their marks grow gaudy over me. they burgeon beneath my clothes. i know i give my wound too much thought and time. gallows loomed outside our sorry solitary cells. “you are in the oldest of our new york jails,” they said. “and we’ve been in books. it’s here they had one of dreiser’s characters arraigned.” the last one of our company to be hanged we found had chopped her husband up and fed him to the hungry swine. they nudged the wan- ing warmth of his flesh. each gave him a rooting touch, translating his dregs into the hopes of pigs. and now with their spirited wish and with his round, astonished face, her changed soul still floats about over their small farm near this little new york town.   2  the door bangs shut in the absolute dark. toilets flush with a great force, and i can hear the old, gentle drunk, my neighbor in the tank, hawk his phlegm and fart. in the early day we line up easily as a cliché for our bread and bowls of gruel. we listen, timeless, for the courthouse bell, play rummy the whole day long and “shoot the moon,” go to bed and jack off to calm down, and scowl harshly, unmanned, at those who were once our friends. the prison of our skins now rises outside and drops in vertical lines before our very eyes.   3  outdoors again, now we can walk to the erie locks (“highest lift locks in the world!”) the old iron bridge has a good bed— cobbles made of wood. things pass through this town everywhere for it was built in opposite tiers. two levels of roads on either side the canal, then two terraces of tracks and higher ranks of beds: roads where trucks lumber awkwardly above the town— like those heavy golden cherubim that try to wing about in the old, baroque church. the little town—with its gothic brick bank, victorian homes with gingerbread frieze and its blasted factories (collapsed, roofs roll- ing back from walls like the lids of eyes)— has died and given up its substance like a hollow duct, smokestack or a pen through which the living stuff flows on.   4  so we walk the long, dead-end track along the shallow, frozen lake where the canal forms a fork (this time of year the locks don’t work). and now and again we look back, for the troopers haunt the five of us out the ledges toward the locks. (we know they want to hose our bellies and our backs. or—as they said— “play the mambo” on our heads.) we do not yet feel quite free— though the blue and yellow, newly painted posts for ships bloom gaily in the cold, and the bulbs about their bases bulge for spring. soon the great, iron gates will open out and the first woman-shaped ship, mammoth, silent, will float toward us like a god come back to make us feel only half afraid. until then, though my friends will be gone from this dry channel of snow and stone, i’ll stay here among the monuments of sheer, brown and gray rock where you can read the names of lovers, sailors and of kids etched in chalk, and in this winter air still keep one hand over my aching ear.  buffalo, march 1967

 she left me at the silent time when the moon had ceas'd to climb the azure path of heaven's steep, and like an albatross asleep, balanc'd on her wings of light, hover'd in the purple night, ere she sought her ocean nest in the chambers of the west. she left me, and i stay'd alone thinking over every tone which, though silent to the ear, the enchanted heart could hear, like notes which die when born, but still haunt the echoes of the hill; and feeling ever—oh, too much!— the soft vibration of her touch, as if her gentle hand, even now, lightly trembled on my brow; and thus, although she absent were, memory gave me all of her that even fancy dares to claim: her presence had made weak and tame all passions, and i lived alone in the time which is our own; the past and future were forgot, as they had been, and would be, not. but soon, the guardian angel gone, the daemon reassum'd his throne in my faint heart. i dare not speak my thoughts, but thus disturb'd and weak i sat and saw the vessels glide over the ocean bright and wide, like spirit-winged chariots sent o'er some serenest element for ministrations strange and far, as if to some elysian star sailed for drink to medicine such sweet and bitter pain as mine. and the wind that wing'd their flight from the land came fresh and light, and the scent of winged flowers, and the coolness of the hours of dew, and sweet warmth left by day, were scatter'd o'er the twinkling bay. and the fisher with his lamp and spear about the low rocks damp crept, and struck the fish which came to worship the delusive flame. too happy they, whose pleasure sought extinguishes all sense and thought of the regret that pleasure leaves, destroying life alone, not peace!

 i don’t remember exactly when budberg died, it was either two years ago or three. the same with chen. whether last year or the one before. soon after our arrival, budberg, gently pensive, said that in the beginning it is hard to get accustomed, for here there is no spring or summer, no winter or fall.  “i kept dreaming of snow and birch forests. where so little changes you hardly notice how time goes by. this is, you will see, a magic mountain.”  budberg: a familiar name in my childhood. they were prominent in our region, this russian family, descendants of german balts. i read none of his works, too specialized. and chen, i have heard, was an exquisite poet, which i must take on faith, for he wrote in chinese.  sultry octobers, cool julys, trees blossom in february. here the nuptial flight of hummingbirds does not forecast spring. only the faithful maple sheds its leaves every year. for no reason, its ancestors simply learned it that way.  i sensed budberg was right and i rebelled. so i won’t have power, won’t save the world? fame will pass me by, no tiara, no crown? did i then train myself, myself the unique, to compose stanzas for gulls and sea haze, to listen to the foghorns blaring down below?  until it passed. what passed? life. now i am not ashamed of my defeat. one murky island with its barking seals or a parched desert is enough to make us say: yes,oui, si. "even asleep we partake in the becoming of the world.” endurance comes only from enduring. with a flick of the wrist i fashioned an invisible rope, and climbed it and it held me.  what a procession!quelles délices! what caps and hooded gowns! most respected professor budberg, most distinguished professor chen, wrong honorable professor milosz who wrote poems in some unheard-of tongue. who will count them anyway. and here sunlight. so that the flames of their tall candles fade. and how many generations of hummingbirds keep them company as they walk on. across the magic mountain. and the fog from the ocean is cool, for once again it is july.  berkeley, 1975

 for ofelia camacho delgado she wakes to the odor of sheep, trying to rub it off her hands. dressed up in her native colors, standing by a tourist van, she is a dandelion, golden like the alpaca woven buttons of her sweater. she is done with the tourists taking her photo, holding a baby lamb.  without official papers in a new country, she briskly walks, and obscenely slow, a foreign tongue slithers by; its scales are the words she has not yet learned to trust. the baby girl hiding in her belly's nest will learn quechua first,runa.                      the people  the sick horses are pushed off the deck of a ship bound for cuba. pursuing, their heads bobbing, clearing the salt from their nostrils, they kick. as long as they can, they swim in the rushing swells, falling behind the ship's scent, swine and men.  know someone who needs their spirits lifted? why not try a lavender or a rose scent?  at the end of a hallway, a machine rattles and spits out ice cubes, some dropping, transparent on the dull vines of the carpet. manuela pushes a cart of towels, shampoo, lotion, and soap bars scented with rose oil. glancing down at the "do not disturb" signs, she walks past the banker taking his third shower and the mother nursing her twins on a blanket spread across the floor. the peepholes are silent as a pile of dirty pillows, some dark never blinking, others bullet holes of light. before leaving the day's inn on mt. vernon, she steals a few soap bars for her daughter, who places them in her dresser drawers, scenting her lingerie, fresh as cut flowers.  a dandelion's root, far deeper, tolerant of drought and poor soil, is not an easily uprooted presence.  manuela hears the creaking of planks, the flapping of sails, and horses stomping, nervous, eyeing the full moon. she sees the marks of hooves in the sand, marks coming out from the sea and vanishing inland. she wakes to that odor again.  this time she stands beside her incan city, its green peaks cutting the sky open, painted on la carreta restaurant's wall. her daughter is taking her photo, saying,"sonríe, mami , sonríe.""smile, mom, smile."  the blindfolded horses are hoisted on board in belly slings, and their feet are tied, slightly touching the deck, suspended for most of the voyage, but once on land some will escape and revert to the wild.  know someone who needs their spirits lifted? why not try a lavender or a rose scent?  she lets the desert in, wild sage. the desert takes her back home while a farmer's pig crosses the highway. she sees her fake id fly off the dashboard. the wheels of her upside-down car spin: suspended, buckled to her seat, feet dangling, she spots the moon on the shards of her windshield, frozen tears, the peepholes blinking back at her.  death touches down like a hoof. a gust of wind pushes the seeds of dandelions upward, a flock of white, a gauze gown drifting over yuccas. memory is the scent of soap bars taking refuge in a daughter's drawer.

 you asked me once, on our way back from the midmorning trip to the spring: “what do you hate, and who do you love?”  and i answered, from behind the eyelashes of my surprise, my blood rushing like the shadow cast by a cloud of starlings: “i hate departure . . . i love the spring and the path to the spring, and i worship the middle hours of morning.” and you laughed . . . and the almond tree blossomed and the thicket grew loud with nightingales.  . . . a question now four decades old: i salute that question’s answer; and an answer as old as your departure; i salute that answer’s question . . .  and today, it’s preposterous, here we are at a friendly airport by the slimmest of chances, and we meet. ah, lord! we meet. and here you are asking—again, it’s absolutely preposterous— i recognized you but you didn’t recognize me. “is it you?!” but you wouldn’t believe it. and suddenly you burst out and asked: “if you’re really you, what do you hate and who do you love?!”  and i answered— my blood fleeing the hall, rushing in me like the shadow cast by a cloud of starlings: “i hate departure, and i love the spring, and the path to the spring, and i worship the middle hours of morning.”  and you wept, and flowers bowed their heads, and doves in the silk of their sorrow stumbled.

 for john gardner it was not kindness, but i was only buckle-high in the door. i let him in because the knock had come, the rain clawed each window and wall. i was afraid. climbing down the stairs i did not know how my country, cunningly, had rotted, but hear, now, my steps creak in memory and the rocks let go in the blind nightglass where you get up, frightened, to reenact the irrational logic of flesh.  even now i can’t see why it happens, the moment of change, but must try to witness each particular index of landscape and irony of promise. i know i was a child when the banging began, sleepless with every light in the house blazing. then the man whose speech entangled me came in from the mud-world. he could not put together the clear words of hope we dream, only the surge of a river. he, who said it wasn’t a fit thing  for anyone, half-grown, to have to imagine in this godforsaken life, said there was a message, the river high, no chance. i remember the wind at that door breaking like a father’s hand on my face. such hurting does not cease and maybe that is why the man went on fumbling for love, for the loving words that might be knowledge. he gave me  this message. i took it, and took, without warning, grief’s language that piece by piece has shown me how to connect dreamed moments skidding like rocks in the silence of a wyoming midnight. each of his rainy words, fragments of the old sickness, passed into me, then he was gone, miserable and emptied, and i had no home but the heart’s hut, the blistering walls of loneliness, the world’s blue skymiles of longing.  common with drowned fir and uncoiling crocus, then, i walked in ignorance and entered this terrible life that was always a dream of the future in the relentless unsleep of those who cannot remember the last thing they wanted to say: that love exists. and in darkness you have dreamed me into your world with their message, their words whispering an hour before black, sudden knocking  that, even as i recall it, begins in your heart’s meat to reverberate, oh, its noise is going to wake you like a dove’s desire. this is the dream of the soft buckling of flesh, the beautiful last erosions, and i swear i would give up these words if i could, i would stop the code of that streetlight just beyond your bed—  but it is too late, for the secret of hope swells in you and who can stop the news that already screams like the roof’s edge leaving its nails over your child’s bed that is, now, splintered and empty as every moment skidding at the back of your neck? leaves not a month old hurl out of the storm and steady splatter of time, and tomorrow will lie still ripening, but only long enough for you to catalog, in dream, what was possible  before the rake must drag its scritch-scratch over ground. all i ask is that you turn to the child inside, those words dreaming and changeless as love’s last chance—let them be said against whatever, crying in the night, we still think may be stopped, the black historical fact of life’s event crashing, like a wall of water, over the actuary’s lawn and yours.  you have seen me before and would not hear, stung by your wife’s fierce beauty, when i called your name, and the day your mother died i begged your attention and got your dollar. i followed you once, in new york, like truth, always to give you the message, and now on your porch, mud-spattered, i am knocking to make you see what love is. call your wife, the police, anyone you like,  for everyone is waiting. we don’t mean to be unkind but are compelled to deliver, faithfully, the words that have been fluttering in your ear like a scream. it is not the wind waking you, but the low roar of years fumbling to tell you what has happened, or will, when the door flies open and the naked message of love stands there stuttering in your face, alive, crying, leaving nothing out.

 his last composed poem, "over my head," closes with the evening tide coming in as the light fails over brighton beach.  in the years of the great plague, he lived with his mother and brother and wrote the elegies that remain unpublished,  under the eaves in an unfinished room above his mother's late-night television vigil. he wrote to a ghostly laugh-track  in the night. though he cut out and saved lurid, five-color magazine pictures of the south pacific, the aegean; though  he hoped for a winter crossing by steamer until his final weakness set in, underneath he was a city boy  whose poems drifted like a dinghy in small inlets—gravesend, rockaway— out too far for safety, in sight of land.

 no reverie begs “light” in the blind eye. reverie says: dig this depth-of-blank  deeper. dig deeper with the whale below the white-capped waves—  a twitch of his tail, a twitch of his white tail birthed from ocean-bed the wave  that broke calm water into each cracked plank of the harpooner’s boat, made that man sway,  and cast him on the spear his arm meant to cast at you. beneath the sun’s evil weight  men burn nightwards but never darken past night. there’s always the moon’s hook  on still water to deny them. but whale, you dive down  until the ocean’s ground begs you solid, “stop.” whale, you do not stop.  you beat your head against the jagged rocks. blind in depths so dark light itself is blind,  you knock your head against the rocks to see and scratch the god-itch from your thoughts.  flame is jealous of flame, once lit, it ever reaches higher. you wait, match-tip, white whale.  i see how you wait in silence for silence to say:write it in, tell me who i am now.

 because this is a monsoon poem expect to find the words jasmine, palmyra, kuruntokai, red; mangoes in reference to trees or breasts; paddy fields, peacocks, kurinji flowers, flutes; lotus buds guarding love’s furtive routes. expect to hear a lot about erotic consummation inferred by laburnum gyrations and bamboo syncopations. listen to the racket of wide-mouthed frogs and bent- legged prawns going about their business of mating while rain falls and falls on tiled roofs and verandas, courtyards, pagodas. because such a big part of you seeks to understand this kind of rain — so unlike your cold rain, austere rain, get-me-the-hell- out-of-here rain. rain that can’t fathom how to liberate camphor from the vaults of the earth. let me tell you how little is written of mud, how it sneaks up like a sleek-gilled vandal to catch hold of your ankles. or about the restorative properties of mosquito blood, dappled and fried against the wires of a bug-zapping paddle. so much of monsoon is to do with being overcome — not from longing as you might think, but from the sky’s steady bludgeoning, until every leaf on every unremembered tree gleams in the abyss of postcoital bliss. come. now sip on your masala tea, put your lips to the sweet, spicy skin of it. there’s more to see — notice the dogs who’ve been fucking on the beach, locked in embrace like an elongated anubis, the crabs scavenging the flesh of a dopey- eyed ponyfish, the entire delirious coast with its philtra of beach and saturnine clouds arched backwards in disbelief. and the mayflies who swarm in november with all their ephemeral grandeur to die in millions at the behest of light, the geckos stationed on living room walls, cramming fistfuls of wings in their maws. notice how hardly anyone mentions the word death, even though the fridge leaks and the sheets have been damp for weeks. and in this helter-skelter multitude of gray-greenness, notice how even the rain begins to feel fatigued. the roads and sewers have nowhere to go, and like old-fashioned pursuers they wander and spill their babbling hearts to electrical poles and creatures with ears. and what happens later, you might ask, after we’ve moved to a place of shelter, when the cracks in the earth have reappeared? we dream of wet, of course, of being submerged in millet stalks, of webbed toes and stalled clocks and eels in the mouth of a heron. we forget how unforgivably those old poems led us to believe that men were mountains, that the beautiful could never remain heartbroken, that when the rains arrive we should be delighted to be taken in drowning, in devotion.  
NEW POEM
 i am no shepherd of a child’s surmises. i have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises,  thirst where the grasses burn in early may and thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay.  there is dust in this air. i saw in the heat grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat.  so to this hour. through the warm dusk i drove to blizzards sifting on the hissing stove,  and found no images of pastoral will, but fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill.

 for pos moua what is the name for an antelope who grazes inside a dream  then vanishes into the nebula’s brush.  what is the face for refurbishing grammar  at each comma’s lip. whose identity never  remembers the shape of beige. what is the word  for how to conjure the sigh of a line hushed  beneath the flap of a thousand shifting plumes.  what is the body of a garden where a crescent  despairs, drifts beneath the melt of amber.  the season is always growing out its hooves.  one cradlesong of your leaving is not larger  than the forest of your arrival. to make you a noun forever.  a loss of you cannot be equal to the loss of you.

 when you walked in it was like recognizing  the moon when he returns. his lover bites his cheek; she  has no choice. all we see is the dissolution, then await  the reconstruction. each time, the sky  yanks her into his orbit. i want to say i’m sorry.  i want to say you win.our bodies are like  the confessional booth these poems are stuck in. even  the priest can see that sin. you’ll be all spit and honey—  or maybe i’m the poisoned flower gnawing on its own  lip because it has no hands to reach for you. only words  that are as useless as the pollen for saying anything. i continue  to serve them even with your hands around my throat from across  the room. your voice is home, i answer it like a bat guided  across the atmosphere. this is a narrative that cannot end  well but wants to, but must. i’ll continue to go down kicking  and you’ll be sweet as anything until you bite back. no, it can’t  end here—we won’t let it. billions of years have passed  since an asteroid last hit the moon: clearly some  magnetic fields can be sustained.

 my mind was once the true survey of all these meadows fresh and gay, and in the greenness of the grass did see its hopes as in a glass; when juliana came, and she what i do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.  but these, while i with sorrow pine, grew more luxuriant still and fine, that not one blade of grass you spy’d but had a flower on either side; when juliana came, and she what i do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.  unthankful meadows, could you so a fellowship so true forgo? and in your gaudy may-games meet while i lay trodden under feet? when juliana came, and she what i do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.  but what you in compassion ought, shall now by my revenge be wrought; and flow’rs, and grass, and i and all, will in one common ruin fall. for juliana comes, and she what i do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.  and thus, ye meadows, which have been companions of my thoughts more green, shall now the heraldry become with which i shall adorn my tomb; for juliana comes, and she what i do to the grass, does to my thoughts and me.

 luxurious man, to bring his vice in use, did after him the world seduce; and from the fields the flow’rs and plants allure, where nature was most plain and pure. he first enclos’d within the garden’s square a dead and standing pool of air; and a more luscious earth for them did knead, which stupefied them while it fed. the pink grew then as double as his mind; the nutriment did change the kind. with strange perfumes he did the roses taint, and flow’rs themselves were taught to paint. the tulip, white, did for complexion seek, and learn’d to interline its cheek; its onion root they then so high did hold, that one was for a meadow sold. another world was search’d, through oceans new, to find the marvel of peru. and yet these rarities might be allow’d, to man, that sov’reign thing and proud; had he not dealt between the bark and tree, forbidden mixtures there to see. no plant now knew the stock from which it came, he grafts upon the wild the tame; that the uncertain and adult’rate fruit might put the palate in dispute. his green seraglio has its eunuchs too, lest any tyrant him out-do; and in the cherry he does nature vex, to procreate without a sex. ’tis all enforc’d, the fountain and the grot, while the sweet fields do lie forgot; where willing nature does to all dispense a wild and fragrant innocence; and fauns and fairies do the meadows till, more by their presence than their skill. their statues polish’d by some ancient hand, may to adorn the gardens stand; but howso’ere the figures do excel, the gods themselves with us do dwell.

 some dictator or other had gone into exile, and now reports were coming about his regime, the usual crimes, torture, false imprisonment, cruelty and corruption, but then a detail: that the way his henchmen had disposed of enemies was by hammering nails into their skulls. horror, then, what mind does after horror, after that first feeling that you’ll never catch your breath, mind imagines—how not be annihilated by it?—the preliminary tap, feels it in the tendons of the hand, feels the way you do with your nail when you’re fixing something, making something, shelves, a bed; the first light tap to set the slant, and then the slightly harder tap, to em-bed the tip a little more ...  no, no more: this should be happening in myth, in stone, or paint, not in reality, not here; it should be an emblem of itself, not itself, something that would mean, not really have to happen, something to go out, expand in implication from that unmoved mass of matter in the breast; as in the image of an anguished face, in grief for us, not us as us, us as in a myth, a moral tale, a way to tell the truth that grief is limitless, a way to tell us we must always understand it’s we who do such things, we who set the slant, embed the tip, lift the sledge and drive the nail, drive the nail which is the axis upon which turns the brutal human world upon the world.

 the mind is an ancient and famous capital   the mind is a city like london, smoky and populous: it is a capital like rome, ruined and eternal, marked by the monuments which no one now remembers. for the mind, like rome, contains catacombs, aqueducts, amphitheatres, palaces, churches and equestrian statues, fallen, broken or soiled. the mind possesses and is possessed by all the ruins of every haunted, hunted generation’s celebration.  “call us what you will: we are made such by love.” we are such studs as dreams are made on, and our little lives are ruled by the gods, by pan, piping of all, seeking to grasp or grasping all of the grapes; and by the bow-and-arrow god, cupid, piercing the heart through, suddenly and forever.  dusk we are, to dusk returning, after the burbing, after the gold fall, the fallen ash, the bronze, scattered and rotten, after the white null statues which are winter, sleep, and nothingness: when will the houselights of the universe light up and blaze? for it is not the sea which murmurs in a shell, and it is not only heart, at harp o’clock, it is the dread terror of the uncontrollable horses of the apocalypse, running in wild dread toward arcturus—and returning as suddenly ...   the fear and dread of the mind of the others   —the others were the despots of despair—  the river’s freshness sailed from unknown sources—  ... they snickered giggled, laughed aloud at last, they mocked and marvelled at the statue which was a caricature, as strained and stiff, and yet a statue of self-love!—since self-love was to them, truly my true love, how, then, was i a stillness of nervousness so nervous a caricature: did they suppose self-love was unrequited, or betrayed? they thought i had fallen in love with my own face, and this belief became the night-like obstacle to understanding all my unbroken suffering, my studious self-regard, the pain of hope, the torment of possibility: how then could i have expected them to see me as i saw myself, within my gaze, or see that being thus seemed as a toad, a frog, a wen, a mole. knowing their certainty that i was only a monument, a monster who had fallen in love with himself alone, how could i have told them what was in me, within my heart, trembling and passionate within the labyrinth and caves of my mind, which is like every mind partly or wholly hidden from itself? the words for what is in my heart and in my mind do not exist. but i must seek and search to find amid the vines and orchards of the vivid world of day approximate images, imaginary parallels for what is my heart and dark within my mind: comparisons and mere metaphors: for all of them are substitutes, both counterfeit and vague: they are, at most, deceptive resemblances, false in their very likeness, like the sons who are alike and kin and more unlike and false because they seem the father’s very self: but each one is —although begotten by the same forbears—himself, the unique self, each one is unique, like every other one, and everything, older or younger, nevertheless a passionate nonesuch who has before has been. do you hear, do you see? do you understand me now, and how the words for what is my heart do not exist?   the river was the emblem of all beauty:   all   ... the river was the abundant belly of beauty itself the river was the dream space where i walked, the river was itself and yet it was—flowing and freshening— a self anew, another self, or self renewed at every tick of eternity, and by each glint of light mounting or sparkling, descending to shade and black —had i but told them my heart, told how it was taunted at noon and pacified at dusk, at starfall midnight strong in hope once more, ever in eagerness jumping like joy, would they have heard? how could they? how, when what they knew was, like the grass, simple and certain, known through the truth of touch, another form and fountain of falsehood’s fecundity— gazing upon their faces as they gazed could they have seen my faces as whores who are holy and deified as priestesses of hope —the sacred virgins of futurity— promising dear divinity precisely because they were disfigured ducks who might become and be, and ever beloved, white swans, noble and beautiful. could they have seen how my faces were bonfires of worship and vigil, blazes of adoration and hope —surely they would have laughed again, renewed their scorn, giggled and snickered, cruel. surely have said this is the puerile mania of the obsessed, the living logic of the lunatic: i was the statue of their merriment, dead and a death, pharoah and monster forsaken and lost.  ... my faces were my apes: my apes became performers in the sundays of their parks, buffoons or clowns in the farce or comedy when they took pleasure in knowing that they were not like me.  ... i waited like obsession in solitude: the sun’s white terror tore and roared at me, the moonlight, almond white, at night, whether awake or sleeping, arrested me and sang, softly, haunted, unlike the sun but as the sun. withheld from me or took away despair or peace, making me once more with thought of what had never been before——

 not your ordinary ice cream, though the glaze of these skeletal figures affects the disposition of those grinning candies one finds in mexico, say, at the start of november, though here, each face is troublingly familiar, exhibits the style adopted just as one declines any further style—nectar one sips just as he draws his last, dispassionate breath, becomes citizen of a less earnest electorate. one learns in that city finally how to enjoy a confection, even if a genuine taste for this circumstance has yet to be acquired, even if it is oneself whose sugars and oils now avail a composure which promises never to end, nor to alter.

 pardon us for uttering a handful of words in any language, so cut loose are we from homes, and from his name that is still nameless, blessed be he. we raised a prayer house—  that is, we broke new wood for one, but some tough burned it, snarling: “carve only stones for the dead.” damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember. but tall ships anchor here, and at low tide,  people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea, just as we’d searched for land. “pray if you must,” my father said, “and when prayer fails, a story, if it is all you have, will do.” months past,  we left recife’s forced-worship laws in the year of their lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new world, old-country amsterdam. leagues seaward, spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew,  and all that was left of us (friends wheezed their last while they ragged us on) rose up on deck and tossed our bags in the sea. we watched the wake turn silver: kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls,  a candelabrum for the promised altar, carved pointers. books’ pages curled and sank, prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward. just as we stared, again we heard swords clank—  a french ship, the ste. catherine(her prow had shone gold on a gray horizon), came to our port side and rescued us. in that commotion on deck, we crouched below—not out of fear,  i swear, but stunned by luminous words that echoed oddly—beautifully—like lightning flickering through palls of thickset clouds. a jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding:  “where are you bound?” “amsterdam. old country.” “where?” “amsterdam.” “antilles?” “no, amsterdam.” “yes, yes. nieuw am sterdam. i’ll see you get there safely.” he meant well, bless him.  ste. catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger than a meadow, fanned out at its sides: manhattan island. our new master, stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases,wheffs, guzzads,  that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully, when we came on a sabbath, more than twenty men, women, a baby born at sea. still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise,  then disappeared among lank citizens with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood on water that we trust and dread, and listen to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.

 i  driving westward near niagara, that transfiguring of the waters, i was torn—as moon from orbit by a warping of gravitation— from coercion of the freeway to the cataract’s prodigality, had to stand there, breathe its rapture, inebriety of the precipice . . .  fingers clamped to iron railings in a tremor of earth’s vibration, i look upstream: foam and boulders wail with a biblical desolation, tree roots, broken oar, a pier end, wrack of the continent dissolving . . .  braced, like tunnel workers hunching from implosion of locomotives, i look down: to ancient chaos, scrawl of the fog for commentary, misty scripture—delphic, jungian—all mythology in gestation, mists that chill our face in passing, soar to a mushroom luminescence . . .  in between, where halos dazzle—as, on a high wire, spangled dancers— on the brink those waters sluice to, in the devil-may-care insouciance of their roistering to glory, no forewarning of what impends, till solid earth dissolves beneath them; all they had banked on once, vacuity . . .  kindled in the hollow wind they flare to a greenish incandescence; channels they defined so smartly in the gusto of their careening all behind them now; before them, blinding haze and the noon’s diffusion . . .   ii  ten feet over those, our railing perched on a spur where verge and void—there!— hiss and arc to touch each other, matter and shadow-matter fuming, we stare through the flow to bedrock, flashing its kodachrome geology. images swirl by—real, fancied—bits of hallucinated litter: gold of oak leaf, taffy wrapper, lavender airmail—assignation? yellow kodak pack, pied comics, tissue a crimson lip had stippled (let’s imagine). some shows vivid, fresh-shellacked in the river’s sepia, all no sooner seen than vanished—on to the brink, its foaming rotos hoarse as all earth’s turbines turning in a thunder of synchronicity. how deep toward the edge? waist? shoulder? as through a woozy lens we scan its floor, old temple tesselation— no, terrain of the moon! medusa’s ancient face, and we stare frozen: stony glare in its vipers’ tangle . . .  still a thought returns and troubles: “no forewarning of what impends, till—” shadow of impends—more menace coiled in the word than fact itself has: fact erodes in action: athens, in the arroyos of her theater, leaned to watch the self-destructing of her blinded grandiosities, willfulness and will, a crash course; then, too late for it, anagnorisis; purged of trivia through immersion in the clotted baths of tragedy, then she knew and was transfigured by contrarious exaltations . . .   iii  eyes can’t leave the livid seething, its reiterative memento! reading, in this bubble chamber, stuff of the world as effervescence, reading every life as half-life, reading in foam the one prognosis . . .  mac the trucker—checkered mackinaw, sort of a baseball cap with earflaps, fists to crinkle up his beer cans—here at the falls is philosophical: “down the tube. that’s life”—he’s waggish, nudging his cozy blonde—“you know, hon?” and she knows. we all know: nature, making a splendor of our banalities, lavishes niagara on us, nudging our knack for the anagogical . . .  meanwhile, earth itself rolls over, nations caught in its tug of traction, from the brink of noon to darkness (but the grandeur of the transition!) gone, like taffy wrapper, tissue: ferny world of the stegosaurus, heraclitus, toe in rivers, coriolanus in corioli, dancing t’ang girl, belles of bali, kings of france with the roman numerals, gone, the fripperies and follies glossed in an architectural digest, halls of mortuary marble, dinky glitz of the rare objet, the aubusson, netsuke, scrimshaw, tiffany, tanagra, bohara, all things au courant, things current—what a word with the gorge before us!— all our bookshelves, facts in folio, paleontology, agronomy, jewels from that cluttered dump, statistics— many a scuffed aladdin’s lamp there: as: one cell’s genetic lore’d fill seventy-five manhattan phone books; as: for each poor soul among us, many a galaxy out there somewhere, each of us more precious—rarer!—than a glittering island universe . . .  we could catalogue forever; there’s no end to the world’s diversity, all that affluence from somewhere, more than a continent behind it; there’s no diminution either from the torrential cornucopia since that primal burst of fireworks, first explosion from singularity; all the things, their scree, diluvium—go to the malls for confirmation: lurid brass shop, teak shop, tech shop, patio ’n’ pool shop, campy duds shop . . .   iv  most we’re through with soon enough, but some! how they lacerate the heart—not savage indignation’s gash—but thrilling, with finer blade, pain’s inmost nerve: the unsigned card i love you kept in a bureau drawer for decades; sweater she wore once, that autumn, rich with the campfire musk; then letters, lavish o, impulsive flourish, “when you’re away, in other cities, it’s their weather reports i look for, first thing in the morning papers . . .” so once the provençal poet, in his rapture about freid’aura: “winter winds that blow from your land feel like heaven upon my cheek here . . .”  they’ve gone too, provence and poet, off in the jumble-carts of history, who was she? that rueful beauty, jewel of the court and joy of kings, who dying murmured, “je me regrette!”—wistful dear, with her curls disheveled on that last of all her pillows, feeling the dark impend—“i’ll miss me!” images swirl by: châteaux that dance in the pool’s hallucination, fêtes and follies effervescing—champagne, glass, and the hand that held them— last, herself, the self where soul is, world of her lavalieres and lovers. did she dream, through mists arising, how on the high wire, floodlit dancer, she had lived her brilliant moment? hear, as the blood ran hushed, sonorous thunders of the living river, more than a continent its source? and not divine—so near the brink where verve like hers and the void meet, seething— wreathed in opulence of sunset, some transfiguring of the waters?

 disturbed at 2 a.m. i hear a claw scratching the window, tapping at the pane, and then i realise, a broken branch, and yet i can’t turn back to sleep again.  slowly, not to wake you, i get up, thinking of food, perhaps a quiet read. a cockroach runs across the kitchen floor, its lacquered shell as quick and dry as seed.  outside the chalice lily lifts its cup in adoration to the mirrored moon, full of purpose as it trembles there, collecting drops of moisture on its spoon.  noises of the night, it’s all alive, birds shifting in the steady trees, slugs and snails eating fallen flowers, a moth freighted with fragilities.  nocturnal life, the other side of things, proceeding whether we observe or not, like rows and rows of brown coastal ants transporting food from here to another spot.  
NEW POEM
 heaven was originally precisely that: the starry sky, dating back to the earliest egyptian texts, which include magic spells that enable the soul to be sewn in the body of the great mother, nut, literally "night," like the seed of a plant, which is also a jewel and a star. the greek elysian fields derive from the same celestial topography: the egyptian "field of rushes," the eastern stars at dawn where the soul goes to be purified. that there is another, mirror world, a world of light, and that this world is simply the sky—and a step further, the breath of the sky, the weather, the very air—is a formative belief of great antiquity that has continued to the present day with the godhead becoming brightness itself: dios/theos (greek); deus/divine/diana (latin); devas (sanskrit); daha (arabic); day (english). —susan brind morrow, wolves and honey 1  gravel paths on hillsides amid moon-drawn vineyards, click of pearls upon a polished nightstand soft as rainwater, self-minded stars, oboe music distant as the grinding of icebergs against the hull of the self and the soul in the darkness chanting to the ecstatic chance of existence. deep is the water and long is the moonlight inscribing addresses in quicksilver ink, building the staircase a lover forever pauses upon. deep is the darkness and long is the night, solid the water and liquid the light. how strange that they arrive at all, nights on planet earth.  2  sometimes, not often but repeatedly, the past invades my dreams in the form of a familiar neighborhood i can no longer locate, a warren of streets lined with dark cafés and unforgettable bars, a place where i can sing by heart every song on every jukebox, a city that feels the way the skin of an octopus looks pulse-changing from color to color, laminar and fluid and electric, a city of shadow-draped churches, of busses on dim avenues, or riverlights, or canyonlands, but always a city, and wonderful, and lost. sometimes it resembles amsterdam, students from the ballet school like fanciful gazelles shooting pool in pink tights and soft, shapeless sweaters, or madrid at 4am, arguing the 18th brumaire with angry marxists, or manhattan when the snowfall crowns every trash-can king of its bowery stoop, or chicago, or dublin, or some ideal city of the imagination, as in a movie you can neither remember entirely nor completely forget, barracuda-faced men drinking sake like yakuza in a harukami novel, women sipping champagne or arrack, the rattle of beaded curtains in the back, the necklaces of christmas lights reflected in raindrops on windows, the taste of peanuts and their shells crushed to powder underfoot, always real, always elusive, always a city, and wonderful, and lost. all night i wander alone, searching in vain for the irretrievable.  3  in the night i will drink from a cup of ashes and yellow paint. in the night i will gossip with the clouds and grow strong. in the night i will cross rooftops to watch the sea tremble in a dream. in the night i will assemble my army of golden carpenter ants. in the night i will walk the towpath among satellites and cosmic dust. in the night i will cry to the roots of potted plants in empty offices. in the night i will gather the feathers of pigeons in a honey jar. in the night i will become an infant before your flag.

 evening falls. someone’s playing a dulcimer northampton-style, on the porch out back. its voice touches and parts the air of summer,  as if  it swam to time us down a river where we dive and leave a single track as evening falls. someone’s playing a dulcimer  that lets us wash our mix of dreams together. delicate, tacit, we engage in our act; its voice touches and parts the air of summer.  when we disentangle you are not with her i am not with him. redress calls for tact. evening falls. someone’s playing a dulcimer  still. a small breeze rises and the leaves stir as uneasy as we, while the woods go black; its voice touches and parts the air of summer  and lets darkness enter us; our strings go slack though the player keeps up his plangent attack. evening falls. someone’s playing a dulcimer; its voice touches and parts the air of summer.

 as soon as i step into the tunnel that will take me under the river i need to cross to get to the city my brain shuts down.  no signal gets through and the question remains how do i know?  with a brain well emptied, and a head a vacuum of nothing, everything i’ve ever known goes quietly absent.  as still and as quiet as a house abandoned or a mouth wide open in a painting.  as soon as i step out of the tunnel scientists squabble about when we should abandon the earth for some other place.  i duck straight back into the tunnel in order to disrupt the signal.  in the tunnel's shelter there is nothing in my head, it's empty enough for the origins of the universe to begin.  a frightening thing interrupted by my backing back out of the tunnel just in time.  in the light of day what's on my mind turns out to be your lifespan. next to the tunnel is the only safe place to be.  it is the only place where it's certain i’ll not all day not need to be crying and weeping to go on.  which draws me directly back into the tunnel to interrupt the signal. it takes a little while for my mind to stop trembling.  
NEW POEM
 the sky was laced with irish cream mist, that mellow tan overhanging the hills, which were studded with deathmasks and baskets spilling flowers from both ends. we scanned the haze for lightning. they were studded with earthworks and iron forks inserted between leaves of grass, jacks and bearings and balances, sinuous fingers of pink marble and synovial joints in bronze. but if we got struck by lightning—not a lot; say glanced, or shaved, there was a chance (we heard) it wouldn't be so bad: a little refreshing, a little like la vita nuova in a readable translation. "in a flash," as they say, we could acquire a self-renewing subscription to classical music (it's always classical in the scientific literature) accessible at all hours and piped into the forebrain from the hypothalamus.  this space available for celebrations. someone visits for the first time and says, "oh, let's get married here" and guests drive in and eye the hors d'oeuvre tent before finding a folding chair. but it isn't long before the mirroring going on between, for instance, the sculptures and the trees—the trees looking more like sculptures, the sculptures getting seasoned, growing bark (patinas) even—it isn't long before it hypnotizes the guests. who would wear a wedding dress in such a charged atmosphere, having heard that ghost story of the wedding dress with the power to possess the soul of the bride? actually it was a horror flick from somewhere, tokyo or calcutta . . . it was a wedding dress that took possession of the soul of its bride the minute she saw it in the mirror, or it saw itself—and this we know happens, but not with the malevolence of this dress that wreaked havoc at the reception, set the hall on fire and dropped a crate of champagne on the string trio. "aha," cries the groom as he realizes the chrysalis of evil he must divide from his bride: "you are hardly an unruffled surface!" no you would not want to wear that dress amid the wireless network of gigantic sculptures and their wind-scraped murmuring. when the wind stirs, is it not the gardeners? the gardeners are invisible, they don't garden during business hours. as you'd put a dye in the air in order to see it, a bird sucked through its drafts advertises the invisible and upgrades it to naked.

 why waste away in a box when you could be a nurse tree? that’s what they call dead logs: mushroomeries of the woods.  your living room’s a wood of couches, books, and chairs. you’re dead not at all, but could you be preparing  for things to grow inside the chest of the log you plan to become: cherished compost heap  where heat turns the brown mess of feelings, sorry, that’s peelings, into comp-o- sition? for we who love  our hands in dirt, a leaf skirt de composing seems an ideal station between this life and next: i visit your room  as on a forest walk. passing a fallen log — is that you? — i see a scarlet fungus cap pop up from friable bark.

 i will do everything you tell me, mother. i will charm three gold hairs from the demon’s head. i will choke the mouse that gnaws an apple tree’s roots and keep its skin for a glove. to the wolf, i will be pretty and kind and curtsy his crossing of my path. the forest, vocal even in its somber tread, rages. a slope ends in a pit of foxes drunk on rotten brambles of berries and the raccoons ransack a rabbit’s unmasked hole. what do they find but a winter’s heap of droppings? a stolen nest, the cracked shell of another creature’s child. i imagine this is the rabbit way and i will not stray, mother, into the forest’s thick, where the trees meet the dark, though i have known misgivings of light as a hot hand that flickers against my neck. the path ends at a river i must cross. i will wait for the ferryman to motion me through. into the waves he etches with his oar a new story: a silent girl runs away, a silent girl is never safe. i will take his oar in my hand. i will learn the boat’s rocking and bring myself back and forth. to be good is the hurricane of caution. i will know indecision’s rowing, the water i lap into my lap as he shakes his withered head. behind me is the forest. before me the field, a loose run of grass. i stay in the river, mother, i study escape.

 it's hard to tell that the face of the moon is as much like a man's as god's. out yonder, in the world without us, who's to say? — either we get in the way, or things make use of us.  half-way around the globe from where they started, the static sound of starlings echoes off the barn roof. spider weave in the spokes of wheels, and stars circle unsuspecting suns. little do we know, the world has a talent for making itself at home.  meanwhile, we paint our self- portraits on everything imaginable, then hold them up like mirrors. our mercurial brushes grow longer, our skills more acute. dust clouds the vision, tinder to the eye. so we burn trees to save the forests, burn air to fly afar. we do, we say. we can. the time  is close at hand. time was (said a man) you could tell the weather from the moon. that was before another broke   the quicksilver distance and walked all over it. now you can't tell a thing.

 o hushed october morning mild, thy leaves have ripened to the fall; tomorrow’s wind, if it be wild, should waste them all. the crows above the forest call; tomorrow they may form and go. o hushed october morning mild, begin the hours of this day slow. make the day seem to us less brief. hearts not averse to being beguiled, beguile us in the way you know. release one leaf at break of day; at noon release another leaf; one from our trees, one far away. retard the sun with gentle mist; enchant the land with amethyst. slow, slow! for the grapes’ sake, if they were all, whose leaves already are burnt with frost, whose clustered fruit must else be lost— for the grapes’ sake along the wall.

 1  a smudge for the horizon that, on a clear day, shows the hard edge of hills and buildings on the other coast. anchored boats all head one way: north, where the wind comes from. you can see the storm inflating out of the west. a dark hole in gray cloud twirls, widens, while white rips multiply on the water far out. wet tousled yellow leaves, thick on the slate terrace. the jay’s hoarse cry. he’s stumbling in the air, too soaked to fly.  2  knuckles of the rain on the roof, chuckles into the drain- pipe, spatters on the leaves that litter the grass. melancholy morning, the tide full in the bay, an overflowing bowl. at least, no wind, no roughness in the sky, its gray face bedraggled by its tears.  3  peeling a pear, i remember my daddy’s hand. his thumb (the one that got nipped by the saw, lacked a nail) fit into the cored hollow of the slippery half his knife skinned so neatly. dad would pare the fruit from our orchard in the fall, while mother boiled the jars, prepared for “putting up.” dad used to darn our socks when we were small, and cut our hair and toenails. sunday mornings, in pajamas, we’d take turns in his lap. he’d help bathe us sometimes. dad could do anything. he built our dining table, chairs, the buffet, the bay window seat, my little desk of cherry wood where i wrote my first poems. that day at the shop, splitting panel boards on the electric saw (oh, i can hear the screech of it now, the whirling blade that sliced my daddy’s thumb), he received the mar that, long after, in his coffin, distinguished his skilled hand.  4  i sit with braided fingers and closed eyes in a span of late sunlight. the spokes are closing. it is fall: warm milk of light, though from an aging breast. i do not mean to pray. the posture for thanks or supplication is the same as for weariness or relief. but i am glad for the luck of light. surely it is godly, that it makes all things begin, and appear, and become actual to each other. light that’s sucked into the eye, warming the brain with wires of color. light that hatched life out of the cold egg of earth.  5  dark wild honey, the lion’s eye color, you brought home from a country store. tastes of the work of shaggy bees on strong weeds, their midsummer bloom. my brain’s electric circuit glows, like the lion’s iris that, concentrated, vibrates while seeming not to move. thick transparent amber you brought home, the sweet that burns.  6  “the very hairs of your head are numbered,” said the words in my head, as the haircutter snipped and cut, my round head a newel poked out of the tent top’s slippery sheet, while my hairs’ straight rays rained down, making pattern on the neat vacant cosmos of my lap. and maybe it was those tiny flies, phantoms of my aging eyes, seen out of the sides floating (that, when you turn to find them full face, always dissolve) but i saw, i think, minuscule, marked in clearest ink, hairs #9001 and #9002 fall, the cut-off ends streaking little comets, till they tumbled to confuse with all the others in their fizzled heaps, in canyons of my lap. and what keeps asking in my head now that, brushed off and finished, i’m walking in the street, is how can those numbers remain all the way through, and all along the length of every hair, and even before each one is grown, apparently, through my scalp? for, if the hairs of my head are numbered, it means no more and no less of them have ever, or will ever be. in my head, now cool and light, thoughts, phantom white flies, take a fling: this discovery can apply to everything.  7  now and then, a red leaf riding the slow flow of gray water. from the bridge, see far into the woods, now that limbs are bare, ground thick-littered. see, along the scarcely gliding stream, the blanched, diminished, ragged swamp and woods the sun still spills into. stand still, stare hard into bramble and tangle, past leaning broken trunks, sprawled roots exposed. will something move?—some vision come to outline? yes, there— deep in—a dark bird hangs in the thicket, stretches a wing. reversing his perch, he says one “chuck.” his shoulder-patch that should be red looks gray. this old redwing has decided to stay, this year, not join the strenuous migration. better here, in the familiar, to fade.

 we are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea-breakers and sitting by desolate streams; world losers and world forsakers, on whom the pale moon gleams: yet we are the movers and shakers of the world for ever, it seems.  with wonderful deathless ditties we build up the world’s great cities. and out of a fabulous story we fashion an empire’s glory: one man with a dream, at pleasure, shall go forth and conquer a crown; and three with a new song’s measure can trample an empire down.  we, in the ages lying in the buried past of the earth, built nineveh with our sighing, and babel itself with our mirth; and o’erthrew them with prophesying to the old of the new world’s worth; for each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.

 home, thou return'st from thames, whose naiads long have seen thee ling'ring, with a fond delay, mid those soft friends, whose hearts, some future day, shall melt, perhaps, to hear thy tragic song. go, not unmindful of that cordial youth, whom, long endear'd, thou leav'st by lavant's side; together let us wish him lasting truth, and joy untainted with his destined bride. go! nor regardless, while these numbers boast my short-lived bliss, forget my social name; but think far off how, on the southern coast, i met thy friendship with an equal flame! fresh to that soil thou turn'st, whose ev'ry vale shall prompt the poet, and his song demand: to thee thy copious subjects ne'er shall fail; thou need'st but take the pencil to thy hand, and paint what all believe who own thy genial land.  there must thou wake perforce thy doric quill, 'tis fancy's land to which thou sett'st thy feet; where still, 'tis said, the fairy people meet beneath each birken shade, on mead or hill. there each trim lass that skims the milky store to the swart tribes their creamy bowl allots; by night they sip it round the cottage-door, while airy minstrels warble jocund notes. there ev'ry herd, by sad experience, knows how, winged with fate, their elf-shot arrows fly, when the sick ewe her summer food forgoes, or, stretched on earth, the heart-smit heifers lie. such airy beings awe th' untutored swain: nor thou, though learned, his homelier thoughts neglect; let thy sweet muse the rural faith sustain; these are the themes of simple, sure effect, that add new conquests to her boundless reign. and fill with double force her heart-commanding strain.  ev'n yet preserv'd, how often may'st thou hear, where to the pole the boreal mountains run, taught by the father to his list'ning son strange lays, whose pow'r had charmed a spenser's ear. at ev'ry pause, before thy mind possessed, old runic bards shall seem to rise around, with uncouth lyres, in many-coloured vest, their matted hair with boughs fantastic crowned: whether thou bidd'st the well-taught hind repeat the choral dirge that mourns some chieftain brave, when ev'ry shrieking maid her bosom beat, and strewed with choicest herbs his scented grave; or whether, sitting in the shepherd's shiel, thou hear'st some sounding tale of war's alarms; when, at the bugle's call, with fire and steel, the sturdy clans pour'd forth their bonny swarms, and hostile brothers met to prove each other's arms.  'tis thine to sing how, framing hideous spells, in skye's lone isle the gifted wizard seer, lodged in the wintry cave with [          ] or in the depth of uist's dark forest dwells: how they, whose sight such dreary dreams engross, with their own visions oft astonished droop, when o'er the wat'ry strath or quaggy moss they see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop. or if in sports, or on the festive green, their [      ] glance some fated youth descry, who, now perhaps in lusty vigour seen and rosy health, shall soon lamented die. for them the viewless forms of air obey, their bidding heed, and at their beck repair. they know what spirit brews the stormful day, and heartless, oft like moody madness stare to see the phantom train their secret work prepare.  [stanza 5 and the first eight lines of stanza 6 are missing]  what though far off, from some dark dell espied, his glimm'ring mazes cheer th' excursive sight, yet turn, ye wand'rers, turn your steps aside, nor trust the guidance of that faithless light! for watchful, lurking mid th' unrustling reed, at those mirk hours the wily monster lies, and listens oft to hear the passing steed, and frequent round him rolls his sullen eyes, if chance his savage wrath may some weak wretch surprise.  ah, luckless swain, o'er all unblest indeed! whom late bewildered in the dank, dark fen, far from his flocks and smoking hamlet then! to that sad spot [            ]: on him, enraged, the fiend, in angry mood, shall never look with pity's kind concern, but instant, furious, raise the whelming flood o'er its drowned banks, forbidding all return. or, if he meditate his wished escape to some dim hill that seems uprising near, to his faint eye the grim and grisly shape, in all its terrors clad, shall wild appear. meantime, the wat'ry surge shall round him rise, poured sudden forth from ev'ry swelling source. what now remains but tears and hopeless sighs? his fear-shook limbs have lost their youthly force, and down the waves he floats, a pale and breathless corse.  for him in vain his anxious wife shall wait, or wander forth to meet him on his way; for him in vain, at to-fall of the day, his bairns shall linger at th' unclosing gate. ah, ne'er shall he return! alone, if night her travell'd limbs in broken slumbers steep, with drooping willows dressed, his mournful sprite shall visit sad, perhaps, her silent sleep: then he, perhaps, with moist and watry hand, shall fondly seem to press her shudd'ring cheek, and with his blue swoll'n face before her stand, and, shiv'ring cold, these piteous accents speak: 'pursue, dear wife, thy daily toils pursue at dawn or dusk, industrious as before; nor e'er of me one hapless thought renew, while i lie welt'ring on the osiered shore, drown'd by the kaelpie's wrath, nor e'er shall aid thee more!'  unbounded is thy range; with varied style thy muse may, like those feath'ry tribes which spring from their rude rocks, extend her skirting wing round the moist marge of each cold hebrid isle, to that hoar pile which still its ruin shows: in whose small vaults a pigmy-folk is found, whose bones the delver with his spade upthrows, and culls them, wond'ring, from the hallowed ground! or thither, where beneath the show'ry west the mighty kings of three fair realms are laid; once foes, perhaps, together now they rest. no slaves revere them, and no wars invade: yet frequent now, at midnight's solemn hour, the rifted mounds their yawning cells unfold, and forth the monarchs stalk with sov'reign pow'r, in pageant robes, and wreathed with sheeny gold, and on their twilight tombs aerial council hold.  but, o! o'er all, forget not kilda's race, on whose bleak rocks, which brave the wasting tides, fair nature's daughter, virtue, yet abides! go, just as they, their blameless manners trace! then to my ear transmit some gentle song, of those whose lives are yet sincere and plain, their bounded walks the rugged cliffs along, and all their prospect but the wintry main. with sparing temp'rance, at the needful time, they drain the sainted spring, or, hunger-pressed, along th' atlantic rock undreading climb, and of its eggs despoil the solan's nest. thus blest in primal innocence they live, sufficed and happy with that frugal fare which tasteful toil and hourly danger give. hard is their shallow soil, [      ] and bare; nor ever vernal bee was heard to murmur there!  nor need'st thou blush, that such false themes engage thy gentle mind, of fairer stores possessed; for not alone they touch the village breast, but filled in elder time th' historic page. there shakespeare's self, with ev'ry garland crowned, in musing hour, his wayward sisters found, and with their terrors dressed the magic scene. from them he sung, when mid his bold design, before the scot afflicted and aghast, the shadowy kings of banquo's fated line through the dark cave in gleamy pageant passed. proceed, nor quit the tales which, simply told, could once so well my answ'ring bosom pierce; proceed, in forceful sounds and colours bold the native legends of thy land rehearse; to such adapt thy lyre and suit thy pow'rful verse. in scenes like these, which, daring to depart from sober truth, are still to nature true, and call forth fresh delight to fancy's view, th' heroic muse employed her tasso's art! how have i trembled when, at tancred's stroke, its gushing blood the gaping cypress poured; when each live plant with mortal accents spoke, and the wild blast up-heaved the vanished sword! how have i sat, where piped the pensive wind, to hear his harp, by british fairfax strung, prevailing poet, whose undoubting mind believed the magic wonders which he sung! hence at each sound imagination glows; hence his warm lay with softest sweetness flows; melting it flows, pure, num'rous, strong, and clear, and fills th' impassioned heart, and lulls th' harmonious ear.  all hail, ye scenes that o'er my soul prevail, ye [       ] friths and lakes which, far away, are by smooth annan filled or past'ral tay, or don's romantic springs, at distance, hail! the time shall come when i, perhaps, may tread your lowly glens, o'erhung with spreading broom, or, o'er your stretching heaths by fancy led: then will i dress once more the faded bow'r, where jonson sat in drummond's [      ] shade; or crop from tiviot's dale each [       ] and mourn on yarrow's banks [       ] meantime, ye pow'rs, that on the plains which bore the cordial youth, on lothian's plains attend, where'er he dwell, on hill or lowly muir, to him i lose, your kind protection lend, and, touched with love like mine, preserve my absent friend

 if aught of oaten stop, or past'ral song, may hope, chaste eve, to soothe thy modest ear, like thy own solemn springs, thy springs and dying gales, o nymph reserved, while now the bright-haired sun sits in yon western tent, whose cloudy skirts, with brede ethereal wove, o'erhang his wavy bed; now air is hushed, save where the weak-ey'd bat with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing, or where the beetle winds his small but sullen horn as oft he rises 'midst the twilight path against the pilgrim, borne in heedless hum: now teach me, maid composed, to breathe some softened strain, whose numbers stealing through thy dark'ning vale may not unseemly with its stillness suit, as musing slow, i hail thy genial loved return. for when thy folding star arising shows his paly circlet, at his warning lamp the fragrant hours, and elves who slept in flowers the day, and many a nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge and sheds the fresh'ning dew, and lovelier still, the pensive pleasures sweet prepare thy shad'wy car. then lead, calm votress, where some sheety lake cheers the lone heath, or some time-hallowed pile or upland fallows grey reflect its last cool gleam. but when chill blust'ring winds, or driving rain, forbid my willing feet, be mine the hut that from the mountain's side views wilds, and swelling floods, and hamlets brown, and dim-discovered spires, and hears their simple bell, and marks o'er all thy dewy fingers draw the gradual dusky veil.  while spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont, and bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest eve; while summer loves to sport beneath thy ling'ring light; while sallow autumn fills thy lap with leaves; or winter, yelling through the troublous air, affrights thy shrinking train and rudely rends thy robes; so long, sure-found beneath the sylvan shed, shall fancy, friendship, science, rose-lipp'd health, thy gentlest influence own, and hymn thy fav'rite name!

 the palm at the end of the mind, beyond the last thought, rises in the bronze decor,  a gold-feathered bird sings in the palm, without human meaning, without human feeling, a foreign song.  you know then that it is not the reason that makes us happy or unhappy. the bird sings. its feathers shine.  the palm stands on the edge of space. the wind moves slowly in the branches. the bird's fire-fangled feathers dangle down.

 ay, tear her tattered ensign down! long has it waved on high, and many an eye has danced to see that banner in the sky; beneath it rung the battle shout, and burst the cannon’s roar;— the meteor of the ocean air shall sweep the clouds no more!  her deck, once red with heroes’ blood where knelt the vanquished foe, when winds were hurrying o’er the flood and waves were white below, no more shall feel the victor’s tread, or know the conquered knee;— the harpies of the shore shall pluck the eagle of the sea!  o, better that her shattered hulk should sink beneath the wave; her thunders shook the mighty deep, and there should be her grave; nail to the mast her holy flag, set every thread-bare sail, and give her to the god of storms,— the lightning and the gale!

 he is tight at first, stiff, stands there atilt tossing the green fluff tennis ball down the side alley, but soon he’s limber, he’s letting it fly and the black lab  lops back each time. these are the true lovers, this dog, this man, and when the dog stops to pee, the old guy hurries him back, then hurls the ball farther away.  now his mother  dodders out, she’s old as the sky, wheeling her green tank with its sweet vein, breath. she tips down the path he’s made for her, grass rippling but trim, soft underfoot,  to survey the yard, every inch of it in fine blossom, set-stone, pruned miniature, split rails docked along the front walk, antique watering cans down-spread—up  huffs the dog again with his mouthy ball— so flowers seem to spill out, red geraniums, grand blue asters, and something i have no name for, wild elsewhere in our world  but here a thing to tend. to call for, and it comes.

 she that but little patience knew, from childhood on, had now so much a grey gull lost its fear and flew down to her cell and there alit, and there endured her fingers' touch and from her fingers ate its bit.  did she in touching that lone wing recall the years before her mind became a bitter, an abstract thing, her thought some popular enmity: blind and leader of the blind drinking the foul ditch where they lie?  when long ago i saw her ride under ben bulben to the meet, the beauty of her country-side with all youth's lonely wildness stirred, she seemed to have grown clean and sweet like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:  sea-borne, or balanced in the air when first it sprang out of the nest upon some lofty rock to stare upon the cloudy canopy, while under its storm-beaten breast cried out the hollows of the sea.

 on the beach at night, stands a child with her father, watching the east, the autumn sky.  up through the darkness, while ravening clouds, the burial clouds, in black masses spreading, lower sullen and fast athwart and down the sky, amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east, ascends large and calm the lord-star jupiter, and nigh at hand, only a very little above, swim the delicate sisters the pleiades.  from the beach the child holding the hand of her father, those burial-clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all, watching, silently weeps.  weep not, child, weep not, my darling, with these kisses let me remove your tears, the ravening clouds shall not long be victorious, they shall not long possess the sky, they devour the stars only in apparition, jupiter shall emerge, be patient, watch again another night, the pleiades shall emerge, they are immortal, all those stars both silvery and golden shall shine out again, the great stars and the little ones shall shine out again, they endure, the vast immortal suns and the long-enduring pensive moons shall again shine.  then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter? considerest thou alone the burial of the stars?  something there is, (with my lips soothing thee, adding i whisper, i give thee the first suggestion, the problem and indirection,) something there is more immortal even than the stars, (many the burials, many the days and nights, passing away,) something that shall endure longer even than lustrous jupiter longer than sun or any revolving satellite, or the radiant sisters the pleiades.  
NEW POEM
 after a night of wind we are surprised by the light, how it flutters up from the back of the sea and leaves us at ease. we can walk along the shore this way or that, all day. sit in the spiky grass among the low whittled bushes, listening to crickets, to the whisk of the small waves, the rattling back of stones. “observation,” our golden nature guide instructs, is the key to science. look all around you. some beaches may be quite barren except for things washed up.” a buoy and a blue bottle, a lightbulb cloudy but unbroken. for an hour my daughter gathers trinkets, bits of good luck. she sings the song she’s just invented: everybody knows when the old days come. although it is october, today falls into the shape of summer, that sense of languid promise in which we are offered another and then another spell of flawless weather. it is the weather of sundays, the weather of memory, and i can see myself sitting on a porch looking out at water, the discreet shores of a lake. three or four white pines were enough of a mystery, how they shook and whispered, how at night i felt them leaning against my window, like the beginning of a story in which children must walk deeper and deeper into a dark forest, and are afraid, yet calm, unaware of the arrangements made for them to survive. my daughter counts her shells and stones, my wife clips bayberry from the pathway. i raise an old pair of binoculars, follow the edge of the sky to the lighthouse, then down into the waves as they fold around rocks humped up out of the sea. i can turn the wheel and blur it all into a dazzle, the pure slips and shards of light. “a steady push of wind,” we read in the book, “gives water its rolling, rising and falling motion. as the sea moves up and down, the wave itself moves forward. as it nears the shore friction from the bottom causes it to rise higher until it tips forward in an arc and breaks.” on the table in front of the house is the day’s collection: sea-glass and starfish, a pink claw, that blue bottle— some to be taken home, arranged in a box, laid on a shelf, later rediscovered, later thrown away, casually, without regret, and some of it, even now, to be discarded, like the lesser stones, and the pale chipped shells which are so alike we can agree that saving one or two will be enough.

 this afternoon the park is filled with brides. among varieties of persuasion the big trees turn back toward the forest. adventurers gather in side streets. the police are looking hard at the sky. down at the bay, boys trapped in solitude fish. girls hike their pants and stare at the wave line, remembering secrets they once held dear. the day offers a ridiculous variation as an excuse for not coming in on time. wild imaginings take the place of religion. someone who can't swim offers to cook. we've devised a means for the obstinate children to be fed, she says, but no one understands this. we crave affection, but give only advice. there are walls topped with broken bicycles. someone makes an obscene offer and this is the best we get all day. oh don't give in so easily she says, handing over the keys. we climb the blue fire escape. we would like to keep going, skyline climbers, old men remembering their childhood who devise a few illegal experiences no one wants to try. it gets to be more than the officers can take. the park is dusty, dark, yet the children, ignored all day, play on, convinced their dedication releases a magic that changes everything.

 child one with the sun in trackless fields of yellow grass and thistle, scent of humid heavy air and the wing music of bees and flies.  child, slender nakedness to itself unknown, true colour of the light dispersed invisibly or glowing around the black hulls of distant thunderheads, around the grasshopper’s countenance, solemn, vigilant and wise.  green apples, poured full of density, of crispness, float unmoved under leaves on the slope. brown fallen apples nest in secret whorls of grass. the apple tree: alone in so much space. and below in the woods by the water a sweet dead branch cracks lightly in the shadow in the wind.  but here is an old track through the grass head-high to a child: who made it? they must have passed and passed by this one tree, by the abandoned, tireless car where rabbits peer out, and the circle of black embers, cans, springs, skeletons of furniture. they too passed here many times on their way from the street’s end to the oaks that screen the river. there the sun is nesting now, night rises with pale flutterings of white wings from roots of plants and the black water.

 the straight neck held up out of the lace is bound with a black velvet band. she holds her mouth the way she chooses, the full underlip constrained by a small muscle.  she doesn’t blink or look aside, although her left eye is considering a slant. she would smile if she had time, but right now  there is composure to be invented. she stares at the photographer. the black crepe settles. emerging from the sleeve, a shapely hand  holds out a white, translucent blossom. “they always say things which embarrass my dog,” she tells the photographer. she is amused, but not as much as he’d like.

NEW POEM
 in memory of the painters paul klee and paul terence feeley i  the painter’s eye follows relation out. his work is not to paint the visible, he says, it is to render visible.  being a man, and not a god, he stands already in a world of sense, from which he borrows, to begin with, mental things chiefly, the abstract elements of language: the point, the line, the plane, the colors and the geometric shapes. of these he spins relation out, he weaves its fabric up so that it speaks darkly, as music does singing the secret history of the mind. and when in this the visible world appears, as it does do, mountain, flower, cloud, and tree, all haunted here and there with the human face, it happens as by accident, although the accident is of design. it is because language first rises from the speechless world that the painterly intelligence can say correctly that he makes his world, not imitates the one before his eyes. hence the delightsome gardens, the dark shores, the terrifying forests where nightfall enfolds a lost and tired traveler.  and hence the careless crowd deludes itself by likening his hieroglyphic signs and secret alphabets to the drawing of a child. that likeness is significant the other side of what they see, for his simplicities are not the first ones, but the furthest ones, final refinements of his thought made visible. he is the painter of the human mind finding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness that is in things, and not the things themselves.  for such a man, art is an act of faith: prayer the study of it, as blake says, and praise the practice; nor does he divide making from teaching, or from theory. the three are one, and in his hours of art there shines a happiness through darkest themes, as though spirit and sense were not at odds.   ii  the painter as an allegory of the mind at genesis. he takes a burlap bag, tears it open and tacks it on a stretcher. he paints it black because, as he has said, everything looks different on black.  suppose the burlap bag to be the universe, and black because its volume is the void before the stars were. at the painter’s hand volume becomes one-sidedly a surface, and all his depths are on the face of it.  against this flat abyss, this groundless ground of zero thickness stretched against the cold dark silence of the absolutely not, material worlds arise, the colored earths and oil of plants that imitate the light.  they imitate the light that is in thought, for the mind relates to thinking as the eye relates to light. only because the world already is a language can the painter speak according to his grammar of the ground.  it is archaic speech, that has not yet divided out its cadences in words; it is a language for the oldest spells about how some thoughts rose into the mind while others, stranger still, sleep in the world.  so grows the garden green, the sun vermilion. he sees the rose flame up and fade and fall and be the same rose still, the radiant in red. he paints his language, and his language is the theory of what the painter thinks.   iii  the painter’s eye attends to death and birth together, seeing a single energy momently manifest in every form, as in the tree the growing of the tree exploding from the seed not more nor less than from the void condensing down and in, summoning sun and rain. he views the tree, the great tree standing in the garden, say, as thrusting downward its vast spread and weight, growing its green height from the dark watered earth, and as suspended weightless in the sky, haled forth and held up by the hair of its head. he follows through the flowing of the forms from the divisions of the trunk out to the veinings of the leaf, and the leaf’s fall. his pencil meditates the many in the one after the method in the confluence of rivers, the running of ravines on mountainsides, and in the deltas of the nerves; he sees how things must be continuous with themselves as with whole worlds that they themselves are not, in order that they may be so transformed. he stands where the eternity of thought opens upon perspective time and space; he watches mind become incarnate; then he paints the tree.   iv  these thoughts have chiefly been about the painter klee, about how he in our hard time might stand to us especially whose lives concern themselves with learning as patron of the practical intelligence of art, and thence as model, modest and humorous in sufferings, for all research that follows spirit where it goes.  that there should be much goodness in the world, much kindness and intelligence, candor and charm, and that it all goes down in the dust after a while, this is a subject for the steadiest meditations of the heart and mind, as for the tears that clarify the eye toward charity.  so may it be to all of us, that at some times in this bad time when faith in study seems to fail, and when impatience in the street and still despair at home divide the mind to rule it, there shall be some comfort come from the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his whom i have thought of, for the wholeness of his mind, as the painter dreaming in the scholar’s house, his dream an emblem to us of the life of thought, the same dream that then flared before intelligence when light first went forth looking for the eye.  
NEW POEM
 sitting between the sea and the buildings he enjoyed painting the sea’s portrait. but just as children imagine a prayer is merely silence, he expected his subject to rush up the sand, and, seizing a brush, plaster its own portrait on the canvas.  so there was never any paint on his canvas until the people who lived in the buildings put him to work: “try using the brush as a means to an end. select, for a portrait, something less angry and large, and more subject to a painter’s moods, or, perhaps, to a prayer.”  how could he explain to them his prayer that nature, not art, might usurp the canvas? he chose his wife for a new subject, making her vast, like ruined buildings, as if, forgetting itself, the portrait had expressed itself without a brush.  slightly encouraged, he dipped his brush in the sea, murmuring a heartfelt prayer: “my soul, when i paint this next portrait let it be you who wrecks the canvas.” the news spread like wildfire through the buildings: he had gone back to the sea for his subject.  imagine a painter crucified by his subject! too exhausted even to lift his brush, he provoked some artists leaning from the buildings to malicious mirth: “we haven’t a prayer now, of putting ourselves on canvas, or getting the sea to sit for a portrait!”  others declared it a self-portrait. finally all indications of a subject began to fade, leaving the canvas perfectly white. he put down the brush. at once a howl, that was also a prayer, arose from the overcrowded buildings.  they tossed him, the portrait, from the tallest of the buildings; and the sea devoured the canvas and the brush as though his subject had decided to remain a prayer.

 we danced to rancorous tunes on spiked ground and our knees sang with each puncture, so that several  agouti colonies, melanic in our russet strengths, learned as wild rats to scurry or guard ourselves from  skin-spite. immune from nocturnal drowsiness we strong-bellied creatures assembled, campaigned;  gyrated to blowed trumpets and cradled songs, but, us black rats with our rogue swagger that spoke  of foreign ports, pranced our survival shuffle in night’s murky dance halls. each step our single  prayer, each jab our benediction. this tart sermon containered our septic hurts and lean swaggers. on  the strike of dawn, we skittered from shadows, the redeemed walking day’s straight-road into warpland.

 once when i was harmless and didn’t know any better,  a mirror to the front of me and an ocean behind,  i lay wedged in the middle of daylight, paper-doll thin, dreaming,  then i vanished. i gave the day a fingerprint, then forgot.  i sat naked on a towel on a hot june monday.  the sun etched the inside of my eyelids, while a boy dozed at my side.  the smell of all oceans was around us— steamy salt, shell, and sweat,  but i reached for the distant one. a tide rose while i slept,  and soon i was alone. try being a figure in memory. it’s hollow there.  for truth’s sake, i’ll say she was on a beach and her eyes were closed.  she was bare in the sand, long, and the hour took her bit by bit.

 groundbreaking ceremony, city of south miami, sunset drive improvements and so it began: the earth torn, split open by a dirt road cutting through palmettos and wild tamarind trees defending the land against the sun. beside the road, a shack leaning into the wind, on the wooden porch, crates of avocados and limes, white chickens pecking at the floor boards, and a man under the shadow of his straw hat, staring into the camera in 1914. he doesn't know within a lifetime the unclaimed land behind him will be cleared of scrub and sawgrass, the soil will be turned, made to give back what the farmers wish, their lonely houses will stand acres apart from one another, jailed behind the boughs of their orchards. he'll never buy sugar at the general store, mail love letters at the post office, or take a train at the depot of the town that will rise out of hundred-million years of coral rock on promises of paradise. he'll never ride a model-t puttering down the dirt road that will be paved over, stretch farther and farther west into the horizon, reaching for the setting sun after which it will be named. he can't even begin to imagine the shadows of buildings rising taller than the palm trees, the street lights glowing like counterfeit stars dotting the sky above the road, the thousands who will take the road everyday, who'll also call this place home less than a hundred years after the photograph of him hanging today in city hall as testament. he'll never meet me, the engineer hired to transform the road again, bring back tree shadows and birdsongs, build another promise of another paradise meant to last another forever. he'll never see me, the poet standing before him, trying to read his mind across time, wondering if he was thinking what i'm today, both of us looking down the road that will stretch on for years after i too disappear into a photo.

 he walks through a cloud of blue moths — one for each apostle — into a round tower  with a peaked chapeau of tiles, the oak door rotted, wasps fierce in the vine, limestone  steps hollowed. rows of nesting boxes dark as the eyes of city whores; pigeons sleeping;  a wedge of sun chiseling mica through dusky air. now the quiet clamor of roosting birds  kept for the eggs he candles in the sacristy; for the sweet meat of their breasts and dung  dug into the abbé’s onion beds; for music of a sort: the crooning of forbidden sex, blood  bubbling from a man’s cut throat. the boy reaches to their stink, peering at novices  working the pump below: their creamy thighs and sleek-dipped heads, their oxter hair and  sideways looks; soapy laughter, stiff nipples, wide eyes, and slender hands. now this back-  plumage black as smeared soot; iridescent necks; this underwing down dense with heat  and lice and suffocating dark. their amber eyes stare incuriously as he kills, wringing  out last sobs of life, lining them up neat as martyrs cut down from a cross of air.

 one granite ridge a tree, would be enough or even a rock, a small creek, a bark shred in a pool. hill beyond hill, folded and twisted tough trees crammed in thin stone fractures a huge moon on it all, is too much. the mind wanders. a million summers, night air still and the rocks warm.   sky over endless mountains. all the junk that goes with being human drops away, hard rock wavers even the heavy present seems to fail this bubble of a heart. words and books like a small creek off a high ledge gone in the dry air.  a clear, attentive mind has no meaning but that which sees is truly seen. no one loves rock, yet we are here. night chills. a flick in the moonlight slips into juniper shadow: back there unseen cold proud eyes of cougar or coyote watch me rise and go.

 today i planted the sand cherry with red leaves— and hope that i can go on digging in this yard, pruning the grape vine, twisting the silver lace on its trellis, the one that bloomed just before the frost flowered over all the garden. next spring i will plant more zinnias, marigolds, straw flowers, pearly everlasting, and bleeding heart. i plant that for you, old love, old friend, and lilacs for remembering.   the lily-of-the-valley with cream-colored bells, bent over slightly, bowing to the inevitable, flowers for a few days, a week. now its broad blade leaves are streaked with brown and the stem dried to a pale hair. in place of the silent bells, red berries like rose hips blaze close to the ground. it is important for me to be down on my knees, my fingers sifting the black earth, making those things grow which will grow. sometimes i save a weed if its leaves are spread fern-like, hand-like, or if it grows with a certain impertinence. i let the goldenrod stay and the wild asters. i save the violets in spring.   people who kill violets will do anything.

 i summon up panofskv from his bed among the famous dead to build a tomb which, since i am not read, suffers the stone’s mortality instead;  which, by the common iconographies of simple visual ease, usurps the place of the complexities of sound survivors once preferred to noise:  monkeys fixed on one bough, an almost holy nightmarish sloth, a tree of parrots in a pride of family, immortal skunks, unaromatically;  some deaf bats in a cave, a porcupine quill-less, a superfine flightless eagle, and, after them, a line of geese, unnavigating by design;  dogs in the frozen haloes of their barks, a hundred porous arks aground and lost, where elephants like quarks ape mother mules or imitation sharks—  and each of them half-venerated by a mob, impartially scaled, finned, or feathered, all before a dry unable mouth, symmetrically awry.  but how shall i, in my brief space, describe a tomb so vast, a tribe so desperately existent for a scribe knowingly of the fashions’ diatribe,  i who have sought time’s memory afoot, grateful for every root of trees that fill the garden with their fruit, their fragrance and their shade? even as i do it,  i see myself unnoticed on the stair that, underneath a clear welcome of bells, had promised me a fair attentive hearing’s joy, sometime, somewhere.

 tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean, tears from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, in looking on the happy autumn-fields, and thinking of the days that are no more.  fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, that brings our friends up from the underworld, sad as the last which reddens over one that sinks with all we love below the verge; so sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.  ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns the earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds to dying ears, when unto dying eyes the casement slowly grows a glimmering square; so sad, so strange, the days that are no more.  dear as remember'd kisses after death, and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd on lips that are for others; deep as love, deep as first love, and wild with all regret; o death in life, the days that are no more!

 i  prodigal, what were your wanderings about? the smoke of homecoming, the smoke of departure. the earth grew music and the tubers sprouted to sesenne's singing, rain-water, fresh patois in a clay carafe, a clear spring in the ferns, and pure things took root like the sweet-potato vine. over the sea at dusk, an arrowing curlew, as the sun turns into a cipher from a green flash, clouds crumble like cities, the embers of carthage; any man without a history stands in nettles and no butterflies console him, like surrendering flags, does he, still a child, long for battles and castles from the books of his beginning, in a hieratic language he will never inherit, but one in which he writes "over the sea at dusk, an arrowing curlew," his whole life a language awaiting translation?  since i am what i am, how was i made? to ascribe complexion to the intellect is not an insult, since it takes its plaid like the invaluable lizard from its background, and if our work is piebald mimicry then virtue lies in its variety to be adept. on the warm stones of florence i subtly alter to a florentine till the sun passes, in london i am pieced by fog, and shaken from reflection in venice, a printed page in the sun on which a cabbage-white unfolds, a bookmark. to break through veils like spiders' webs, crack carapaces like a day-moth and achieve a clarified frenzy and feel the blood settle like a brown afternoon stream in river doree is what i pulsed for in my brain and wrist for the drifting benediction of a drizzle drying on this page like asphalt, for peace that passes like a changing cloud, to a hawk's slow pivot.  ii  in the vale of santa cruz i look to the hills. the white flowers have the fury of battle, they lay siege to the mountains, for war there is the tumult of the white ravines, and the cascade's assault; they bow their plumes, queen anne's lace, bougainvillea, orchid and oleander, and they are as white as arrested avalanches, angry and alpine, their petals blur into a white gust from the matterhom or the streets of zermatt. both worlds are welded, they were seamed by delight. santa cruz, in spring. deep hills with blue clefts. i have come back for the white egrets feeding in a flock on the lawn, darting their bills in that finical stride, gawkily elegant, then suddenly but leisurely sailing to settle, but not too far off, like angels.  iii  i wake at sunrise to angelic screams. and time is measuring my grandchildren's cries and time outpaces the sepia water of the racing creek, time takes its leisure, cunning in the blocked hollows of the pool, the elephantine stones in the leaf-marked lagoon, time sails with the soundless buzzard over the smoking hills and the clouds that fray and change and time waits very quiet between the mountains and the brown tracks in the valleys of the northern range, a cover of overhanging bamboo, in maraval where, if the bed were steeper, a brown stream races or tries to, pooling in rocks, with great avail for me at least, or where a range's blues and indigo over which wide hawks sail their shadows on the wells of santa cruz, dark benedictions on the brook's muttering shale, and the horses are slowly plunging their manes as they climb up from the paved-with-lilies pond, so much mythology in their unharnessed necks! these little things take root as i add my praise to the huge lawn at the back of the house, a field, a bright, unaltered meadow, a small savannah for cries and bicycles and joy-crazed dogs bolting after pedalling boys, the crescent ghost of the new moon showing and on the thick slopes this forest like green billowing smoke pierced by the flame petals of the immortelle.  iv  petals of the flame tree against ice-cream walls and the arches across the park with its tacit fountain, the old idlers on the benches, this is the prose that spreads like the shade of an immortal banyan in front of the library, the bulk that darkens the violin of twilight when traffic has vanished and nearly over also the colonial regime when the wharves cradled the rocking schooners of our boyhood to the echo of vespers in the alien cathedral. in the hot green silence a dragonfly's drone crossing the scorched hill to the shade of the cedars and spiced laurels, the lauriers canelles, the word itself lifting the plurals of its leaves, from the hot ground, from this page, the singeing smells. how simple to write this after you have gone, that your death that afternoon had the same ease as stopping at the side of the road under the trees to buy cassava bread that comes in two sorts sweet and unsweetened, from the huge cauldron, on the road between soufrière and canaries. the heat collects in the depths between the ridges and the high hawks circle in the gathering haze; like consonants round a vowel, insistent midges hum round noun's hexagon, and the hornet's house. delve in the hot, still valley of soufrière, the black, baking asphalt and its hedges dripping shade and here is the ultimate nullity despite the moil of the churning vegetation. the small church hidden in leaves. in mid-afternoon, the halt– then dart of a quizzical lizard across the road.  
NEW POEM
 one day the earth will be just a blind space turning, night confused with day. under the vast andean sky there’ll be no more mountains, not a rock or ravine.  only one balcony will remain of all the world’s buildings, and of the human mappa mundi, limitless sorrow. in place of the atlantic ocean, a little saltiness in the air, and a fish, flying and magical with no knowledge of the sea.  in a car of the 1900s (no road for its wheels) three girls of that time, pressing onwards like ghosts in the fog. they’ll peer through the door thinking they’re nearing paris when the odor of the sky grips them by the throat.  instead of a forest there’ll be one bird singing, which nobody will ever place, or prefer, or even hear. except for god, who listening out, proclaims it a goldfinch.  
NEW POEM
 what's left is footage: the hours before camille, 1969—hurricane parties, palm trees leaning in the wind, fronds blown back,  a woman's hair. then after: the vacant lots, boats washed ashore, a swamp  where graves had been. i recall  how we huddled all night in our small house, moving between rooms, emptying pots filled with rain.  the next day, our house— on its cinderblocks—seemed to float  in the flooded yard: no foundation  beneath us, nothing i could see tying us                      to the land. in the water, our reflection trembled, disappeared when i bent to touch it.  
NEW POEM
 heads were rolling down the highway in high slat trucks. i knew it was time to buy you and found you, the last sphere unscarred and undistorted in the store, big as my own head.  it was time too to leave you uncut and full-featured, like the grandpa of twenty-five pumpkins in my past, khrushchev-cheeked and dwelling on yourself, great knee of my childhood.  i plainly thought you would rot. i remembered the fetor of other pumpkins, their blue populations coming out of hiding as if at the end of some apocalypse.  i devoted a day to reading up on minor cucurbits: i learned your dozen names in african and came home ready to raise or raze you, positive of change.  but so far—eternity. i think i would not like eternity, after i had used my senses up, as i’ve tried with you—fingertips dragging over your world pole to pole  till they go dead like explorers, nostril cilia detecting your fragrance more delicate than they— and my patience. it’s christmas, it’s a new year and i hear  of a family who’s kept you for four ... you endure like matter manufactured and indeed your stem seems punched into your orange gathers like a button in a mattress.  shall i give you a room or a shrine? and shall i purchase you a mate and family, when ours is so inadequate, fixed upon your window deathbed as we are,  centered upon a time and birth, new holiday, new friends, new pumpkins, celebrating when all that has failed us has passed away. you have not failed.  
NEW POEM
 oh, greenly and fair in the lands of the sun, the vines of the gourd and the rich melon run, and the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold, with broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold, like that which o'er nineveh's prophet once grew, while he waited to know that his warning was true, and longed for the storm-cloud, and listened in vain for the rush of the whirlwind and red fire-rain.  on the banks of the xenil the dark spanish maiden comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden; and the creole of cuba laughs out to behold through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold; yet with dearer delight from his home in the north, on the fields of his harvest the yankee looks forth, where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines, and the sun of september melts down on his vines.  ah! on thanksgiving day, when from east and from west, from north and from south come the pilgrim and guest, when the gray-haired new englander sees round his board the old broken links of affection restored, when the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more, and the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before, what moistens the lip and what brightens the eye? what calls back the past, like the rich pumpkin pie?  oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling, when wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling! when wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin, glaring out through the dark with a candle within! when we laughed round the corn-heap, with hearts all in tune, our chair a broad pumpkin,—our lantern the moon, telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam, in a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team!  then thanks for thy present! none sweeter or better e'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter! fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine, brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking, than thine! and the prayer, which my mouth is too full to express, swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less, that the days of thy lot may be lengthened below, and the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow, and thy life be as sweet, and its last sunset sky golden-tinted and fair as thy own pumpkin pie!

 it is not that you want to be the one to make prints in the untrampled snow it is that you want to be in the snow without having touched it to be of  the snow not beginning everywhere commerce dictates the shapes that move you along that seat you at the table far from the snow far from the act of not touching it only gets worse a girl’s gotta eat and your hunger’s not even your own  
NEW POEM
 exalted life this  not because you know slavish attention or sit  bathed in the royal jellies and rarer distillates  nor because it commences backlit all  by droning buzz and the mellow  scent of lilac   but for your ignorance of desire  for your cloistering, liege  never wondering what tastes abound in distant clusters  so rich is your interior your fecundity  your multiple dark imaginings  never saying as i do why and again why  never saying as i do to the world of surrounding combs  do you think i may someday escape  
NEW POEM
 after al-sayyah the radio blares “dialogue of souls,” and the woman who hated clouds watches the sky. where is the sea now? she asks. where is it from here? what is its name?— this rain on a morning ride to school, winter, my seventh year, my father driving through rain, his eyes fixed on a world of credit and debt. on the radio, devotion to the lifter of harm from those who despair, knower of secrets with the knowledge of certainty. not even the anguish of those years, the heavy traffic, cold and wind could have touched me. i was certain the palm holding me would be struck again. chance allows for that and for stars to throb in reachable depths. filled with grief bordering happiness, i didn’t care if i was safe, whether the storm was over, only that it came, the slash of lightning, the groaning sky, and the storms we made, how rain stripped everything of urgency, how to the lifter of harm rise those who despair.  
NEW POEM
 it was a good idea, cutting away the vines and ivy, trimming back the chest-high thicket lazy years had let grow here. though it wasn’t for lack  of love for the trees, i’d like to point out. years love trees in a way we can’t imagine. they just don’t use the fruit like us; they want instead the slant  of sun through narrow branches, the buckshot of rain on these old cherries. and we, now that i think on it, want those things too, we just always and desperately  want the sugar of the fruit, the best we’ll get from this irascible land: sweetness we can gather for years, new stains staining the stains on our hands.  
NEW POEM
 oh! dost thou flatter falsely, hope? the day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth, yet thy white wings are plumed to all their scope, and hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light, and grown so large and bright, that my whole future life unfolds what seems, beneath their gentle beams, a path that leads athwart some guiltless earth, to which a star is dropping from the night!  not many moons ago, but when these leafless beds were all aglow with summer’s dearest treasures, i was reading in this lonely garden-nook; a july noon was cloudless in the sky, and soon i put my shallow studies by; then sick at heart, and angered by the book, which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh of some one who had quarreled with his kind, vexed at the very proofs which i had sought, and all annoyed while all alert to find a plausible likeness of my own dark thought, i cast me down beneath yon oak’s wide boughs, and, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows, watched lazily the shadows of my brain. the feeble tide of peevishness went down, and left a flat dull waste of dreary pain which seemed to clog the blood in every vein; the world, of course, put on its darkest frown— in all its realms i saw no mortal crown which did not wound or crush some restless head; and hope, and will, and motive, all were dead. so, passive as a stone, i felt too low to claim a kindred with the humblest flower; even that would bare its bosom to a shower, while i henceforth would take no pains to live, nor place myself where i might feel or give a single impulse whence a wish could grow. there was a tulip scarce a gossamer’s throw beyond that platanus. a little child, most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled a hint that i should pluck it for her sake. ah, me! i trust i was not well awake— the voice was very sweet, yet a faint languor kept me in my seat. i saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heard some low expostulating tones, but stirred not even a leaf’s length, till the pretty fay, wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat, climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away.  and here again, but led by other powers, a morning and a golden afternoon, these happy stars, and yonder setting moon, have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked, a round of precious hours. oh! here, where in that summer noon i basked, and strove, with logic frailer than the flowers, to justify a life of sensuous rest, a question dear as home or heaven was asked, and without language answered. i was blest! blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust unto the telltale confidence of song. love to his own glad self is sometimes coy, and even thus much doth seem to do him wrong; while in the fears which chasten mortal joy, is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free, with the cold touch of hard reality, should turn its priceless jewels into dust. since that long kiss which closed the morning’s talk, i have not strayed beyond this garden walk. as yet a vague delight is all i know, a sense of joy so wild ’t is almost pain, and like a trouble drives me to and fro, and will not pause to count its own sweet gain. i am so happy! that is all my thought! to-morrow i will turn it round and round, and seek to know its limits and its ground. to-morrow i will task my heart to learn the duties which shall spring from such a seed, and where it must be sown, and how be wrought. but oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed! and for one day i choose to seal the urn wherein is shrined love’s missal and his creed. meantime i give my fancy all it craves; like him who found the west when first he caught the light that glittered from the world he sought, and furled his sails till dawn should show the land; while in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves go rippling brightly up a golden strand.  hath there not been a softer breath at play in the long woodland aisles than often sweeps at this rough season through their solemn deeps— a gentle ariel sent by gentle may, who knew it was the morn on which a hope was born, to greet the flower ere it was fully blown, and nurse it as some lily of her own? and wherefore, save to grace a happy day, did the whole west at blushing sunset glow with clouds that, floating up in bridal snow, passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away! and now, if i may trust my straining sight, the heavens appear with added stars to-night, and deeper depths, and more celestial height, than hath been reached except in dreams or death. hush, sweetest south! i love thy delicate breath; but hush! methought i felt an angel’s kiss! oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss. that lonely fir, which always seems as though it locked dark secrets in itself, hideth a gentle elf, whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams. can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop? to-night i shall not seek my curtained nest, but even here find rest. who whispered then? and what are they that peep betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there? come, fairy shadows! for the morn is near, when to your sombre pine ye all must creep; come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere my spirit sinks into the gulf of sleep; even now it circles round and round the deep— appear! appear!  
NEW POEM
 little chihuahita shadowed beside segundo barrio. a dead german sheperd with a broken neck lies on the side of the street for days. the stench of el paso’s sewage in the air, a mexican flag hugely flaps itself above the chain-linked fence  topped with razor wire. in the morning blue mountains smog. south side of the border a man jogs. the river’s bank green, small trees bob in the wind like truffle-treats, mirage. each day thousands cross the open bridge, both ways,  each night they go home to sleep silence. cars hum and wait for hours like sleeping cats. a cemented river half-dried, even the canal drains away. some say droves of shadows at night move ghost-like through the dying river. these people grow invisible, as if air, irrelevant and holy;  at night i can hear the whisper of my grandfather, “all the angels live in juárez.” there is an old language broken in my throat. some eyes mistake me for shadow. when i speak my voice a fearful phantom. in spring dust storms come, the sky  browns, my visage half-forms beneath the italian cypress; and when the day’s moon is full in its silence, i am afraid of my own darkness.  
NEW POEM
 no one can draw fast enough to capture the cut iris before its form falls from its former self. but when we passed a patch in the ditch, she told me to stop and she stepped down, opening her clasp knife. she spared one iris with an impressionistic cocoon on its stem and cut the flower beside it. once home she rendered in a careful hurry. she drew into the night as the iris died. i woke grafted to her in a vague, translucent hammock of dread.  
NEW POEM
 to a friend no! those days are gone away and their hours are old and gray, and their minutes buried all under the down-trodden pall of the leaves of many years: many times have winter's shears, frozen north, and chilling east, sounded tempests to the feast of the forest's whispering fleeces, since men knew nor rent nor leases.  no, the bugle sounds no more, and the twanging bow no more; silent is the ivory shrill past the heath and up the hill; there is no mid-forest laugh, where lone echo gives the half to some wight, amaz'd to hear jesting, deep in forest drear.  on the fairest time of june you may go, with sun or moon, or the seven stars to light you, or the polar ray to right you; but you never may behold little john, or robin bold; never one, of all the clan, thrumming on an empty can some old hunting ditty, while he doth his green way beguile to fair hostess merriment, down beside the pasture trent; for he left the merry tale messenger for spicy ale.  gone, the merry morris din; gone, the song of gamelyn; gone, the tough-belted outlaw idling in the "grenè shawe"; all are gone away and past! and if robin should be cast sudden from his turfed grave, and if marian should have once again her forest days, she would weep, and he would craze: he would swear, for all his oaks, fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes, have rotted on the briny seas; she would weep that her wild bees sang not to her—strange! that honey can't be got without hard money!  so it is: yet let us sing, honour to the old bow-string! honour to the bugle-horn! honour to the woods unshorn! honour to the lincoln green! honour to the archer keen! honour to tight little john, and the horse he rode upon! honour to bold robin hood, sleeping in the underwood! honour to maid marian, and to all the sherwood-clan! though their days have hurried by let us two a burden try.

 to sow the remote morose root. to sow the virtuous standby. the backup fodder-crop suffers not from seasonal vicissitudes, mildew and blast, caterpillar attack.  under saturn sing the golden-sickled beet. under saturn sing the ringed mangelwurzel. the great turnip (the dick reuben!). the pickled paucity-strick stew.  
NEW POEM
 the hard thing’s to sit without being noticed. everything else will come easy. three sips and the impulse returns to sit thinking alone. against the buzzing backdrop of noise everything fades, and it’s suddenly a miracle to be born and to stare at the glass. and work (a man who’s alone can’t not think of work) becomes again the old fate that suffering’s good for focusing thought. and soon the eyes fix on nothing particular, grieved, as if blind.  if this man gets up and goes home to sleep, he’ll look like a blind man that’s lost. anyone could jump out of nowhere to brutally beat him. a woman—beautiful, young—might appear, and lie under a man in the street, and moan, the way a woman once moaned under him. but this man doesn’t see. he heads home to sleep and life becomes nothing but the buzzing of silence.  undressing this man you’d find a body that’s wasted and, here and there, patches of fur. who’d think, to look at this man, that life once burned in his lukewarm veins? no one would guess that there was a woman, once, who gently touched that body, who kissed that body, which shakes, and wet it with tears, now that the man, having come home to sleep, can’t sleep, only moan.  
NEW POEM
 there, in that lost corner of the ordnance survey. drive through the vanity — two pubs and a garage — of satley, then right, cross the a68 past down-at-heel farms and a quarry,  you can't miss it, a 't' instead of a 'plus' where the road meets a wall. if it's a usual day there'll be freezing wind, and you'll stumble climbing the stile (a ladder, really) as you pull  your hat down and zip up your jacket. out on the moor, thin air may be strong enough to knock you over, but if you head into it downhill, you can shelter  in the wide, cindery trench of an old leadmine-to-consett railway. you may have to share it with a crowd of dirty supercilious-looking ewes, who will baaa and cut jerkily away  after posting you blank stares from their foreign eyes. one winter we came across five steaming, icicle-hung cows. but in summer, when the heather's full of nests, you'll hear curlews  following you, raking your memory, maybe, with their cries; or, right under you nose, a grouse will whirr up surprised, like a poet startled by a line when it comes to her sideways.  no protection is offered by trees — hawthorn the english call may, a few struggling birches. but of wagtails and yellowhammers, plenty, and peewits who never say peewit, more a minor,go'way, go'way.  who was he, salter? why was this his gate? a pedlars' way, they carried salt to meat. the place gives tang to survival, its unstoppable view, a reservoir, ruins of the lead mines, new forestry pushing from the right, the curlew.  
NEW POEM
 maurice, weep not, i am not here under this pine tree. the balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass, the stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls, but thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous in the blest nirvana of eternal light! go to the good heart that is my husband, who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh i won spirit, and through spirit, peace. there is no marriage in heaven, but there is love.  
NEW POEM
 when fall brought the graders to atlas road, i drove through gray dust thick as a battle and saw the ditch freshly scattered with gravel.  leveling, shaving on the bevel, the blade and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers— limestone loaves and blue slate, skulls of quartz  not even early freeze had roused. some rocks were large as buckets, others just a scone tumbled up and into light the first time  in ages. loose, sharp, they were a hazard to anyone passing. so i gathered what i could, scooped them into the bed  and trucked my freight away under birdsong in my own life's autumn. i was eager to add to the snaggled wall bordering  my single acre, to be safe, to be still and watch the planet's purposeful turning behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones.  uprooted, scarred, weather-gray of bones, i love their old smell, the familiar unknown. to be sure this time i know where i belong  i have brought, at last, the vagrant road home.  
NEW POEM
 in the barn demoted to garage, the ax in a cherry stump can’t be budged.  daylight perforates siding despite the battered armor of license plates—  corroded colors, same state: decay, their dates the only history  of whoever tilled the soil and left, as a welcome, the skull  of a possum nailed to the door, and the trail of lime to the torn sack  in a corner where cobwebs festoon a scythe. rusted sharp, it sings  when he grips its splintery handle, swings, and crowns topple from queen anne’s lace.  
NEW POEM
 the man was white, grey and pale brown, the colorless colors of a used-up earth where water has sunk down, sunk down so low and risen so far above the grey-white pale-brown heaven and shrunk so far within itself that it will not come back. what can moisten a shriveled water, or can a clod of ash regain colors from the identical howl of a white powder sun?  not in me, he said, ever again, but in the street with engine and worker petals, not papery, more fragile than that, there will be color. my eye will reach color, all colors, every one together, which no one will see in me ever again.  i turned to the sky then and it was all one blue, the color of seeing, and yet was as many blues, as subtle, as tones of stubble in the most sunken cheek.  
NEW POEM
 sleep, love sleep, the night winds sigh, in soft lullaby. the lark is at rest with the dew on her breast. so close those dear eyes, that borrowed their hue from the heavens so blue, sleep, love sleep.  sleep, love sleep, the pale moon looks down on the valleys around, the glow moth is flying, the south wind is sighing, and i am low lying, with lute deftly strung, to pour out my song, sleep, love sleep.  
NEW POEM
 a shadow on the wall boughs stirred by the noonday wind that’s enough earth and for the eye enough celestial participation.  how much further do you want to go? refuse the bossy insistence of new impressions—  lie there still, behold your own fields, your estate, dwelling especially on the poppies, unforgettable because they transported the summer—  where did it go?  
NEW POEM
 shall earth no more inspire thee, thou lonely dreamer now? since passion may not fire thee shall nature cease to bow?  thy mind is ever moving in regions dark to thee; recall its useless roving— come back and dwell with me.  i know my mountain breezes enchant and soothe thee still— i know my sunshine pleases despite thy wayward will.  when day with evening blending sinks from the summer sky, i’ve seen thy spirit bending in fond idolatry.  i’ve watched thee every hour; i know my mighty sway, i know my magic power to drive thy griefs away.  few hearts to mortals given on earth so wildly pine; yet none would ask a heaven more like this earth than thine.  then let my winds caress thee; thy comrade let me be— since nought beside can bless thee, return and dwell with me.  
NEW POEM
 they perched on roofs and fences and sills. they posed statue-still on catenary lines. they aligned along cables like prayer beads on rope. they amassed en masse on the cemetery lawn and marauded the broad, yawning fields like cattle. their cackles were black. each shadow dove and pecked. they nested in chimneys and chirped at the chime of the church bell. they worked in shifts. clocked out at odd hours. they laid their eggs in the v s of trees. they teemed on the dry-baked banks of creek beds, streams the sun had overseen. they teetered on the bed-knob tops of flagpoles. they pitched like pennies into founts. they pitched like babies into wells. they thumped at doors then skulked away like hoodlum teens. they jabbed her. when she cried they did it faster. everyone knows what happened next. some grew big as sunflower stalks, others tall like bonfire flames. or moving vans. or the sick, brick houses people die inside of every night. their hatchlings canopied the sky. was it her fault, then, when they pinned her to the ground and thrust their feathers down her throat? or wormed between her legs in bad-man ways? or rattled plumes and whooped and beat her body with their wings? or locked their talons to her thighs and tra-la-la-ed that ditty from the old-time music box? or forced their whiskies past her lips? or put her in the pillory? this was foreplay, in a way. they rolled in rabid packs and woofed like dogs. she couldn’t throw a bone. the meat was gone. they chased her and they named her and they boiled her tears and bathed her. then they ate her.

 all the old photographs, hidden like buried treasure. broken prayer sticks under my dreams  and my worn mattress. each one like a postcard sent back home; wonders only seen in slick travel magazines.  boxed up under my bed, colored souls on kodak paper— i can still see grandma’s smile next to her resting sheep dog.  like a blue lightning strike over the northern sky, over two black houses, i pull the first leaf out, at random.  a picture-flash: tom and susie worker are sitting together on a couch covered with a large navajo chief’s blanket woven  by her brown hands and sheep’s wool. the pattern of stripes— blue to black to white, shifting like rain clouds to clear skies.  my grandparents look tired. the day was christmas 1992, with a little bit of snow on the earth. tired from traveling  over 100 miles away from their painted desert to the city, tired from raising eleven children of the deer  spring before the depression, before roosevelt, before the world wars, before computers, before  satellite phones and televisions . . . . outside, the north wind was blowing tuba city away. but, grandma’s and grandpa’s  eyes are glazed red from happiness. outside, the clouds swelled full of snow and ice.  a blue lightning flash, another photograph, another place: new york, 1985: i see the statue of liberty, tiny, like a pin  stuck in the gray ocean, surrounded by the wrought metal edges of gotham city. it was the only picture i took:  the dollar-bill green lady holding her torch, guiding moths, reality, men and ferries. as she stood in iconic  pose, grandma flooded back, quickly: strong in her own green velvet dress, she stretched dough over her palms, making frybread.  a foghorn wailed just past the emerald city’s fiery torch. my mind refocused on the warm glow of a new moon.  the lady’s light filled the starless sky like grandma’s teardrop turquoise and silver brooch. made from a thousand tiny kingman  nuggets, its shine captured in a perfect burst— a sunflower high on a green stem. each seed a raindrop  made of smooth sky. when the sun touched the brooch, it was blinding. a perfect mosaic of water-light-sky stones.  a blue strike—bright from a cigarette—steals lady liberty’s light. the staten island ferry moves on to crow agency, montana.  at custer battlefield, my cousins smile for a picture, tourists next to custer’s grave. defiant, wearing dark shades,  they hold up cans of coors light waiting for custer to rise again so they can take up their bows, arrows, uzis. warriors,  proud and ready to hide deep in the yellowtail prairie grass. their women and children safe in tipi camps by the little  bighorn river. i know they would die again and again. rise again and again to put up more white marble tombstones.  they would do this to save our future children, to save our grandmas—mary black eagle, susie worker, great great great  grandmother lefthand . . . . they would save our grandfathers too— sonny black eagle, tom worker, the horned toad . . . .  lodge grass indians, the high school basketball team, plays a few miles from mary’s block house and her ten grazing horses.  her basketball team is waiting for the final winning basket to end time, an orange ball to shoot dead the visiting team  from billings. another war of savages versus whites. won this time by the “skins”—class “b” state champs again.  two leggings, a ’49, a warrior’s party. the tranquil dark raven feathers, a deep cold night fueled by a bonfire and beer.  victory runs hot, steaming piss into the trout-filled river lined by a hundred cars, nights caws, and some more tame  drinking brawls. all night long, the happy indian basketball warriors sing ’49 songs:we won, but my dark-hair girlfriend  left with one of the blue-eyed. he na ya na

 do not a civilization make. do they? cozy up to the fleece of a sheep, take the lid off elizabeth bishop’s head and get a spoon. do not eat yet; do not swoon. there will be hours for that. first there is a long war march. then there are other animals to press into the barn before the lightning storm comes to cook the grass and rinse it and make a mess. but this is all outside and you need never go there. can you ride a tin? yes, you can, says the child detective. the poet lies under the sheep, reading of robert menzies, his wife pattie, and their pets. “we had a lovely weekend,” they tell reporters. just months later their cat’s dead. robert turns from the golden syrup, while deciding whether to use a knife or a spoon, the television on though it’s only 8 am . elizabeth was reading her poetry aloud into a woolly microphone. she thought she saw the top of robert’s head pass by the window. she was thinking of the story “marmosets” she was translating, by clarice lispector. a spirit moved out of the shadows and found an unopened tin in the cupboard and threw it at the window, causing the monkeys on the verandah to flee from the glass. you can hear it on the recording at pennsound. a shearer found glass in a sheep’s fleece months later. “lucky.” “why lucky?” “lucky it didn’t take your thumb off.” that was what bishop heard about it. she wanted something to give to clarice. something in wool or a painting. she saw the earth tipping up, as if she was falling over while looking out the window, and she was traveling to australia via a flying tin of golden syrup, where there were sheep all ready to cushion her, but it wasn’t necessary for she fell into the arms of the prime minister. “tilted space age pastoral,” she thought, but “marmoset” was what she murmured up at him. he could hear his wife crying that their cat was dead. “it was bloody asio!” she bawled. saying sorry, he dropped the unexpected visitor on the lawn and went to his wife’s aid. he spread one of the scones he’d baked earlier and made a fresh pot. “i don’t want any of that asio muck,” pattie grizzled. robert turned to elizabeth to see if she could hear, ready to explain how upset his wife was. elizabeth had found a curious black spread in the cupboard and was helping herself. “that’s not food,” baa’d the sheep detective. lightning struck where they’d been sitting just minutes before. “life is not flat, that’s for sure,” elizabeth thought to herself, remembering the sheep in the window back home, and starting to write a poem. it would be about flying through the air, and strange food, and the floury arms of a patriarch.

 there were bees about. from the start i thought the day was apt to hurt. there is a high hill of sand behind the sea and the kids were dropping from the top of it like schools of fish over falls, cracking skulls on skulls. i knew the holiday was hot. i saw the august sun teeming in the bodies logged along the beach and felt the yearning in the brightly covered parts turning each to each. for lunch i bit the olive meat: a yellow jacket stung me on the tongue. i knelt to spoon and suck the healing sea ... a little girl was digging up canals with her toes, her arm hanging in a cast as white as the belly of a dead fish whose dead eye looked at her with me, as she opened her grotesque system to the sea ... i walked away; now quietly i heard a child moaning from a low mound of sand, abandoned by his friend. the child was tricked, trapped upon his knees in a shallow pit. (the older ones will say you can get out.) i dug him up. his legs would not unbend. i lifted him and held him in my arms as he wept. oh i was gnarled as a witch or warlock by his naked weight, was slowed in the sand to a thief’s gait. when his strength flowed, he ran, and i rested by the sea ... a girl was there. i saw her drop her hair, let it fall from the doffed cap to her breasts tanned and swollen over wine red woolen. a boy, his body blackened by the sun, rose out of the sand stripping down his limbs with graceful hands. he took his gear and walked toward the girl in the brown hair and wine and then past me; he brushed her with the soft, brilliant monster he lugged into the sea ... by this tide i raised a small cairn of stone light and smooth and clean, and cast the shadow of a stick in a perfect line along the sand. my own shadow followed then, until i felt the cold swirling at the groin.

 since there is no escape, since at the end my body will be utterly destroyed, this hand i love as i have loved a friend, this body i tended, wept with and enjoyed; since there is no escape even for me who love life with a love too sharp to bear: the scent of orchards in the rain, the sea and hours alone too still and sure for prayer— since darkness waits for me, then all the more let me go down as waves sweep to the shore in pride, and let me sing with my last breath; in these few hours of light i lift my head; life is my lover—i shall leave the dead if there is any way to baffle death.

 three years ago, in the afternoons, i used to sit back here and try to answer the simple arithmetic of my life, but never could figure it— this object and that object never contained the landscape nor all of its implications, this tree and that shrub never completely satisfied the sum or quotient i took from or carried to, nor do they do so now, though i'm back here again, looking to calculate, looking to see what adds up.  everything comes from something, only something comes from nothing, lao tzu says, more or less. eminently sensible, i say, rubbing this tiny snail shell between my thumb and two fingers. delicate as an earring, it carries its emptiness like a child it would be rid of. i rub it clockwise and counterclockwise, hoping for anything resplendent in its vocabulary or disguise— but one and one make nothing, he adds, endless and everywhere, the shadow that everything casts.

 1. the ice hook untwists inside the whirlwind like a tail.  a raven’s rib ripped from the electric socket heats the palm, its rusted core bound by the apple’s shaven hide.  like a concussion cushioned between fingertips— egg batter congeals in cracks of concrete.  the fourth generation of bees flee the unlocked mouth.  the stoplight blinks midway between wing, beak, and worm unwinding inside braided corn husk, pulsing near the foot of the interrogator as he slams the gate shut.  the interrogator, every atom belonging to him, says: you there—hook and worm, you there—carved pebbles tucked under the glacier, your apathy grows like gray hair in these untied shoes.  the tundra’s anvil and spine are flung back into the quarried pockets of the pilgrim.  the “safe feeling” blossoms next to the caged wren.  motor oil trickles from the harpooned log.  the milky way backbones the nervous system of the stream the deer sips.  this is where i broke the ice,  broke the sun’s neck, and the city raised its sunflower above a pond of gathered lice.  the storm took care of it! reached down, hammered them flat. walls erected, stoned down, down, and as we fled, we unbraided our hair from the fan belt of the exhumed engine.  one twin kissed the other in the uncovered wagon.   2. we watched them unravel from their neckties, and took the shape of rain clouds blotting out the noon sun.  in their houses— the long night gloved the mist inside our gills.  and i stained the plaques clean, memorized each brick flung from the window, while roosters crowed the grip loose.  who made them leap from shelves unnamed? made them buckle down low, pulled out by their tails from between each lie cupped inside another one?  a spear was driven into it— underneath the pilgrim’s skirt: the skyline of a missing tooth.

 at midnight, in the month of june, i stand beneath the mystic moon. an opiate vapor, dewy, dim, exhales from out her golden rim, and softly dripping, drop by drop, upon the quiet mountain top, steals drowsily and musically into the universal valley. the rosemary nods upon the grave; the lily lolls upon the wave; wrapping the fog about its breast, the ruin moulders into rest; looking like lethe, see! the lake a conscious slumber seems to take, and would not, for the world, awake. all beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies irene, with her destinies!  oh, lady bright! can it be right— this window open to the night? the wanton airs, from the tree-top, laughingly through the lattice drop— the bodiless airs, a wizard rout, flit through thy chamber in and out, and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully—so fearfully— above the closed and fringéd lid ’neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid, that, o’er the floor and down the wall, like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? why and what art thou dreaming here? sure thou art come o’er far-off seas, a wonder to these garden trees! strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress! strange, above all, thy length of tress, and this all solemn silentness!  the lady sleeps! oh, may her sleep, which is enduring, so be deep! heaven have her in its sacred keep! this chamber changed for one more holy, this bed for one more melancholy, i pray to god that she may lie forever with unopened eye, while the pale sheeted ghosts go by!  my love, she sleeps! oh, may her sleep, as it is lasting, so be deep! soft may the worms about her creep! far in the forest, dim and old, for her may some tall vault unfold— some vault that oft hath flung its black and wingéd pannels fluttering back, triumphant, o’er the crested palls of her grand family funerals—  some sepulchre, remote, alone, against whose portals she hath thrown, in childhood, many an idle stone— some tomb from out whose sounding door she ne’er shall force an echo more, thrilling to think, poor child of sin! it was the dead who groaned within.  
NEW POEM
 to the memory of the household it describes this poem is dedicated by the author  “as the spirits of darkness be stronger in the dark, so good spirits, which be angels of light, are augmented not only by the divine light of the sun, but also by our common wood fire: and as the celestial fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our fire of wood doth the same.” —cor. agrippa, occult philosophy, book i.ch. v.  “announced by all the trumpets of the sky, arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields, seems nowhere to alight: the whited air hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven, and veils the farm-house at the garden’s end. the sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace, enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm.” emerson, the snow storm. the sun that brief december day rose cheerless over hills of gray, and, darkly circled, gave at noon a sadder light than waning moon. slow tracing down the thickening sky its mute and ominous prophecy, a portent seeming less than threat, it sank from sight before it set. a chill no coat, however stout, of homespun stuff could quite shut out, a hard, dull bitterness of cold, that checked, mid-vein, the circling race of life-blood in the sharpened face, the coming of the snow-storm told. the wind blew east; we heard the roar of ocean on his wintry shore, and felt the strong pulse throbbing there beat with low rhythm our inland air.  meanwhile we did our nightly chores,— brought in the wood from out of doors, littered the stalls, and from the mows raked down the herd’s-grass for the cows; heard the horse whinnying for his corn; and, sharply clashing horn on horn, impatient down the stanchion rows the cattle shake their walnut bows; while, peering from his early perch upon the scaffold’s pole of birch, the cock his crested helmet bent and down his querulous challenge sent.  unwarmed by any sunset light the gray day darkened into night, a night made hoary with the swarm and whirl-dance of the blinding storm, as zigzag, wavering to and fro, crossed and recrossed the wingëd snow: and ere the early bedtime came the white drift piled the window-frame, and through the glass the clothes-line posts looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.  so all night long the storm roared on: the morning broke without a sun; in tiny spherule traced with lines of nature’s geometric signs, in starry flake, and pellicle, all day the hoary meteor fell; and, when the second morning shone, we looked upon a world unknown, on nothing we could call our own. around the glistening wonder bent the blue walls of the firmament, no cloud above, no earth below,— a universe of sky and snow! the old familiar sights of ours took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers rose up where sty or corn-crib stood, or garden-wall, or belt of wood; a smooth white mound the brush-pile showed, a fenceless drift what once was road; the bridle-post an old man sat with loose-flung coat and high cocked hat; the well-curb had a chinese roof; and even the long sweep, high aloof, in its slant splendor, seemed to tell of pisa’s leaning miracle.  a prompt, decisive man, no breath our father wasted: “boys, a path!” well pleased, (for when did farmer boy count such a summons less than joy?) our buskins on our feet we drew; with mittened hands, and caps drawn low, to guard our necks and ears from snow, we cut the solid whiteness through. and, where the drift was deepest, made a tunnel walled and overlaid with dazzling crystal: we had read of rare aladdin’s wondrous cave, and to our own his name we gave, with many a wish the luck were ours to test his lamp’s supernal powers. we reached the barn with merry din, and roused the prisoned brutes within. the old horse thrust his long head out, and grave with wonder gazed about; the cock his lusty greeting said, and forth his speckled harem led; the oxen lashed their tails, and hooked, and mild reproach of hunger looked; the hornëd patriarch of the sheep, like egypt’s amun roused from sleep, shook his sage head with gesture mute, and emphasized with stamp of foot.  all day the gusty north-wind bore the loosening drift its breath before; low circling round its southern zone, the sun through dazzling snow-mist shone. no church-bell lent its christian tone to the savage air, no social smoke curled over woods of snow-hung oak. a solitude made more intense by dreary-voicëd elements, the shrieking of the mindless wind, the moaning tree-boughs swaying blind, and on the glass the unmeaning beat of ghostly finger-tips of sleet. beyond the circle of our hearth no welcome sound of toil or mirth unbound the spell, and testified of human life and thought outside. we minded that the sharpest ear the buried brooklet could not hear, the music of whose liquid lip had been to us companionship, and, in our lonely life, had grown to have an almost human tone.  as night drew on, and, from the crest of wooded knolls that ridged the west, the sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank from sight beneath the smothering bank, we piled, with care, our nightly stack of wood against the chimney-back,— the oaken log, green, huge, and thick, and on its top the stout back-stick; the knotty forestick laid apart, and filled between with curious art the ragged brush; then, hovering near, we watched the first red blaze appear, heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam on whitewashed wall and sagging beam, until the old, rude-furnished room burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom; while radiant with a mimic flame outside the sparkling drift became, and through the bare-boughed lilac-tree our own warm hearth seemed blazing free. the crane and pendent trammels showed, the turks’ heads on the andirons glowed; while childish fancy, prompt to tell the meaning of the miracle, whispered the old rhyme: “under the tree, when fire outdoors burns merrily, there the witches are making tea.”  the moon above the eastern wood shone at its full; the hill-range stood transfigured in the silver flood, its blown snows flashing cold and keen, dead white, save where some sharp ravine took shadow, or the sombre green of hemlocks turned to pitchy black against the whiteness at their back. for such a world and such a night most fitting that unwarming light, which only seemed where’er it fell to make the coldness visible.  shut in from all the world without, we sat the clean-winged hearth about, content to let the north-wind roar in baffled rage at pane and door, while the red logs before us beat the frost-line back with tropic heat; and ever, when a louder blast shook beam and rafter as it passed, the merrier up its roaring draught the great throat of the chimney laughed; the house-dog on his paws outspread laid to the fire his drowsy head, the cat’s dark silhouette on the wall a couchant tiger’s seemed to fall; and, for the winter fireside meet, between the andirons’ straddling feet, the mug of cider simmered slow, the apples sputtered in a row, and, close at hand, the basket stood with nuts from brown october’s wood.  what matter how the night behaved? what matter how the north-wind raved? blow high, blow low, not all its snow could quench our hearth-fire’s ruddy glow. o time and change!—with hair as gray as was my sire’s that winter day, how strange it seems, with so much gone of life and love, to still live on! ah, brother! only i and thou are left of all that circle now,— the dear home faces whereupon that fitful firelight paled and shone. henceforward, listen as we will, the voices of that hearth are still; look where we may, the wide earth o’er, those lighted faces smile no more. we tread the paths their feet have worn, we sit beneath their orchard trees, we hear, like them, the hum of bees and rustle of the bladed corn; we turn the pages that they read, their written words we linger o’er, but in the sun they cast no shade, no voice is heard, no sign is made, no step is on the conscious floor! yet love will dream, and faith will trust, (since he who knows our need is just,) that somehow, somewhere, meet we must. alas for him who never sees the stars shine through his cypress-trees! who, hopeless, lays his dead away, nor looks to see the breaking day across the mournful marbles play! who hath not learned, in hours of faith, the truth to flesh and sense unknown, that life is ever lord of death, and love can never lose its own! we sped the time with stories old, wrought puzzles out, and riddles told, or stammered from our school-book lore “the chief of gambia’s golden shore.” how often since, when all the land was clay in slavery’s shaping hand, as if a far-blown trumpet stirred the languorous sin-sick air, i heard: “does not the voice of reason cry, claim the first right which nature gave, from the red scourge of bondage to fly, nor deign to live a burdened slave!“ our father rode again his ride on memphremagog’s wooded side; sat down again to moose and samp in trapper’s hut and indian camp; lived o’er the old idyllic ease beneath st. françois’ hemlock-trees; again for him the moonlight shone on norman cap and bodiced zone; again he heard the violin play which led the village dance away. and mingled in its merry whirl the grandam and the laughing girl. or, nearer home, our steps he led where salisbury’s level marshes spread mile-wide as flies the laden bee; where merry mowers, hale and strong, swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along the low green prairies of the sea. we shared the fishing off boar’s head, and round the rocky isles of shoals the hake-broil on the drift-wood coals; the chowder on the sand-beach made, dipped by the hungry, steaming hot, with spoons of clam-shell from the pot. we heard the tales of witchcraft old, and dream and sign and marvel told to sleepy listeners as they lay stretched idly on the salted hay, adrift along the winding shores, when favoring breezes deigned to blow the square sail of the gundelow and idle lay the useless oars.  our mother, while she turned her wheel or run the new-knit stocking-heel, told how the indian hordes came down at midnight on concheco town, and how her own great-uncle bore his cruel scalp-mark to fourscore. recalling, in her fitting phrase, so rich and picturesque and free (the common unrhymed poetry of simple life and country ways,) the story of her early days,— she made us welcome to her home; old hearths grew wide to give us room; we stole with her a frightened look at the gray wizard’s conjuring-book, the fame whereof went far and wide through all the simple country side; we heard the hawks at twilight play, the boat-horn on piscataqua, the loon’s weird laughter far away; we fished her little trout-brook, knew what flowers in wood and meadow grew, what sunny hillsides autumn-brown she climbed to shake the ripe nuts down, saw where in sheltered cove and bay, the ducks’ black squadron anchored lay, and heard the wild-geese calling loud beneath the gray november cloud.  then, haply, with a look more grave, and soberer tone, some tale she gave from painful sewel’s ancient tome, beloved in every quaker home, of faith fire-winged by martyrdom, or chalkley’s journal, old and quaint,— gentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint!— who, when the dreary calms prevailed, and water-butt and bread-cask failed, and cruel, hungry eyes pursued his portly presence mad for food, with dark hints muttered under breath of casting lots for life or death, offered, if heaven withheld supplies, to be himself the sacrifice. then, suddenly, as if to save the good man from his living grave, a ripple on the water grew, a school of porpoise flashed in view. “take, eat,” he said, “and be content; these fishes in my stead are sent by him who gave the tangled ram to spare the child of abraham.”  our uncle, innocent of books, was rich in lore of fields and brooks, the ancient teachers never dumb of nature’s unhoused lyceum. in moons and tides and weather wise, he read the clouds as prophecies, and foul or fair could well divine, by many an occult hint and sign, holding the cunning-warded keys to all the woodcraft mysteries; himself to nature’s heart so near that all her voices in his ear of beast or bird had meanings clear, like apollonius of old, who knew the tales the sparrows told, or hermes, who interpreted what the sage cranes of nilus said; a simple, guileless, childlike man, content to live where life began; strong only on his native grounds, the little world of sights and sounds whose girdle was the parish bounds, whereof his fondly partial pride the common features magnified, as surrey hills to mountains grew in white of selborne’s loving view,— he told how teal and loon he shot, and how the eagle’s eggs he got, the feats on pond and river done, the prodigies of rod and gun; till, warming with the tales he told, forgotten was the outside cold, the bitter wind unheeded blew, from ripening corn the pigeons flew, the partridge drummed i’ the wood, the mink went fishing down the river-brink. in fields with bean or clover gay, the woodchuck, like a hermit gray, peered from the doorway of his cell; the muskrat plied the mason’s trade, and tier by tier his mud-walls laid; and from the shagbark overhead the grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.  next, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer and voice in dreams i see and hear,— the sweetest woman ever fate perverse denied a household mate, who, lonely, homeless, not the less found peace in love’s unselfishness, and welcome wheresoe’er she went, a calm and gracious element, whose presence seemed the sweet income and womanly atmosphere of home,— called up her girlhood memories, the huskings and the apple-bees, the sleigh-rides and the summer sails, weaving through all the poor details and homespun warp of circumstance a golden woof-thread of romance. for well she kept her genial mood and simple faith of maidenhood; before her still a cloud-land lay, the mirage loomed across her way; the morning dew, that dries so soon with others, glistened at her noon; through years of toil and soil and care, from glossy tress to thin gray hair, all unprofaned she held apart the virgin fancies of the heart. be shame to him of woman born who hath for such but thought of scorn.  there, too, our elder sister plied her evening task the stand beside; a full, rich nature, free to trust, truthful and almost sternly just, impulsive, earnest, prompt to act, and make her generous thought a fact, keeping with many a light disguise the secret of self-sacrifice. o heart sore-tried! thou hast the best that heaven itself could give thee,—rest, rest from all bitter thoughts and things! how many a poor one’s blessing went with thee beneath the low green tent whose curtain never outward swings!  as one who held herself a part of all she saw, and let her heart against the household bosom lean, upon the motley-braided mat our youngest and our dearest sat, lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes, now bathed in the unfading green and holy peace of paradise. oh, looking from some heavenly hill, or from the shade of saintly palms, or silver reach of river calms, do those large eyes behold me still? with me one little year ago:— the chill weight of the winter snow for months upon her grave has lain; and now, when summer south-winds blow and brier and harebell bloom again, i tread the pleasant paths we trod, i see the violet-sprinkled sod whereon she leaned, too frail and weak the hillside flowers she loved to seek, yet following me where’er i went with dark eyes full of love’s content. the birds are glad; the brier-rose fills the air with sweetness; all the hills stretch green to june’s unclouded sky; but still i wait with ear and eye for something gone which should be nigh, a loss in all familiar things, in flower that blooms, and bird that sings. and yet, dear heart! remembering thee, am i not richer than of old? safe in thy immortality, what change can reach the wealth i hold? what chance can mar the pearl and gold thy love hath left in trust with me? and while in life’s late afternoon, where cool and long the shadows grow, i walk to meet the night that soon shall shape and shadow overflow, i cannot feel that thou art far, since near at need the angels are; and when the sunset gates unbar, shall i not see thee waiting stand, and, white against the evening star, the welcome of thy beckoning hand?  brisk wielder of the birch and rule, the master of the district school held at the fire his favored place, its warm glow lit a laughing face fresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared the uncertain prophecy of beard. he teased the mitten-blinded cat, played cross-pins on my uncle’s hat, sang songs, and told us what befalls in classic dartmouth’s college halls. born the wild northern hills among, from whence his yeoman father wrung by patient toil subsistence scant, not competence and yet not want, he early gained the power to pay his cheerful, self-reliant way; could doff at ease his scholar’s gown to peddle wares from town to town; or through the long vacation’s reach in lonely lowland districts teach, where all the droll experience found at stranger hearths in boarding round, the moonlit skater’s keen delight, the sleigh-drive through the frosty night, the rustic party, with its rough accompaniment of blind-man’s-buff, and whirling-plate, and forfeits paid, his winter task a pastime made. happy the snow-locked homes wherein he tuned his merry violin, or played the athlete in the barn, or held the good dame’s winding-yarn, or mirth-provoking versions told of classic legends rare and old, wherein the scenes of greece and rome had all the commonplace of home, and little seemed at best the odds ’twixt yankee pedlers and old gods; where pindus-born arachthus took the guise of any grist-mill brook, and dread olympus at his will became a huckleberry hill.  a careless boy that night he seemed; but at his desk he had the look and air of one who wisely schemed, and hostage from the future took in trainëd thought and lore of book. large-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he shall freedom’s young apostles be, who, following in war’s bloody trail, shall every lingering wrong assail; all chains from limb and spirit strike, uplift the black and white alike; scatter before their swift advance the darkness and the ignorance, the pride, the lust, the squalid sloth, which nurtured treason’s monstrous growth, made murder pastime, and the hell of prison-torture possible; the cruel lie of caste refute, old forms remould, and substitute for slavery’s lash the freeman’s will, for blind routine, wise-handed skill; a school-house plant on every hill, stretching in radiate nerve-lines thence the quick wires of intelligence; till north and south together brought shall own the same electric thought, in peace a common flag salute, and, side by side in labor’s free and unresentful rivalry, harvest the fields wherein they fought.  another guest that winter night flashed back from lustrous eyes the light. unmarked by time, and yet not young, the honeyed music of her tongue and words of meekness scarcely told a nature passionate and bold, strong, self-concentred, spurning guide, its milder features dwarfed beside her unbent will’s majestic pride. she sat among us, at the best, a not unfeared, half-welcome guest, rebuking with her cultured phrase our homeliness of words and ways. a certain pard-like, treacherous grace swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash, lent the white teeth their dazzling flash; and under low brows, black with night, rayed out at times a dangerous light; the sharp heat-lightnings of her face presaging ill to him whom fate condemned to share her love or hate. a woman tropical, intense in thought and act, in soul and sense, she blended in a like degree the vixen and the devotee, revealing with each freak or feint the temper of petruchio’s kate, the raptures of siena’s saint. her tapering hand and rounded wrist had facile power to form a fist; the warm, dark languish of her eyes was never safe from wrath’s surprise. brows saintly calm and lips devout knew every change of scowl and pout; and the sweet voice had notes more high and shrill for social battle-cry.  since then what old cathedral town has missed her pilgrim staff and gown, what convent-gate has held its lock against the challenge of her knock! through smyrna’s plague-hushed thoroughfares, up sea-set malta’s rocky stairs, gray olive slopes of hills that hem thy tombs and shrines, jerusalem, or startling on her desert throne the crazy queen of lebanon with claims fantastic as her own, her tireless feet have held their way; and still, unrestful, bowed, and gray, she watches under eastern skies, with hope each day renewed and fresh, the lord’s quick coming in the flesh, whereof she dreams and prophesies!  where’er her troubled path may be, the lord’s sweet pity with her go! the outward wayward life we see, the hidden springs we may not know. nor is it given us to discern what threads the fatal sisters spun, through what ancestral years has run the sorrow with the woman born, what forged her cruel chain of moods, what set her feet in solitudes, and held the love within her mute, what mingled madness in the blood, a life-long discord and annoy, water of tears with oil of joy, and hid within the folded bud perversities of flower and fruit. it is not ours to separate the tangled skein of will and fate, to show what metes and bounds should stand upon the soul’s debatable land, and between choice and providence divide the circle of events; but he who knows our frame is just, merciful and compassionate, and full of sweet assurances and hope for all the language is, that he remembereth we are dust!  at last the great logs, crumbling low, sent out a dull and duller glow, the bull’s-eye watch that hung in view, ticking its weary circuit through, pointed with mutely warning sign its black hand to the hour of nine. that sign the pleasant circle broke: my uncle ceased his pipe to smoke, knocked from its bowl the refuse gray, and laid it tenderly away; then roused himself to safely cover the dull red brands with ashes over. and while, with care, our mother laid the work aside, her steps she stayed one moment, seeking to express her grateful sense of happiness for food and shelter, warmth and health, and love’s contentment more than wealth, with simple wishes (not the weak, vain prayers which no fulfilment seek, but such as warm the generous heart, o’er-prompt to do with heaven its part) that none might lack, that bitter night, for bread and clothing, warmth and light.  within our beds awhile we heard the wind that round the gables roared, with now and then a ruder shock, which made our very bedsteads rock. we heard the loosened clapboards tost, the board-nails snapping in the frost; and on us, through the unplastered wall, felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall. but sleep stole on, as sleep will do when hearts are light and life is new; faint and more faint the murmurs grew, till in the summer-land of dreams they softened to the sound of streams, low stir of leaves, and dip of oars, and lapsing waves on quiet shores.  next morn we wakened with the shout of merry voices high and clear; and saw the teamsters drawing near to break the drifted highways out. down the long hillside treading slow we saw the half-buried oxen go, shaking the snow from heads uptost, their straining nostrils white with frost. before our door the straggling train drew up, an added team to gain. the elders threshed their hands a-cold, passed, with the cider-mug, their jokes from lip to lip; the younger folks down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled, then toiled again the cavalcade o’er windy hill, through clogged ravine, and woodland paths that wound between low drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed. from every barn a team afoot, at every house a new recruit, where, drawn by nature’s subtlest law, haply the watchful young men saw sweet doorway pictures of the curls and curious eyes of merry girls, lifting their hands in mock defence against the snow-ball’s compliments, and reading in each missive tost the charm with eden never lost.  we heard once more the sleigh-bells’ sound; and, following where the teamsters led, the wise old doctor went his round, just pausing at our door to say, in the brief autocratic way of one who, prompt at duty’s call, was free to urge her claim on all, that some poor neighbor sick abed at night our mother’s aid would need. for, one in generous thought and deed, what mattered in the sufferer’s sight the quaker matron’s inward light, the doctor’s mail of calvin’s creed? all hearts confess the saints elect who, twain in faith, in love agree, and melt not in an acid sect the christian pearl of charity!  so days went on: a week had passed since the great world was heard from last. the almanac we studied o’er, read and reread our little store of books and pamphlets, scarce a score; one harmless novel, mostly hid from younger eyes, a book forbid, and poetry, (or good or bad, a single book was all we had,) where ellwood’s meek, drab-skirted muse, a stranger to the heathen nine, sang, with a somewhat nasal whine, the wars of david and the jews. at last the floundering carrier bore the village paper to our door. lo! broadening outward as we read, to warmer zones the horizon spread in panoramic length unrolled we saw the marvels that it told. before us passed the painted creeks, and daft mcgregor on his raids in costa rica’s everglades. and up taygetos winding slow rode ypsilanti’s mainote greeks, a turk’s head at each saddle-bow! welcome to us its week-old news, its corner for the rustic muse, its monthly gauge of snow and rain, its record, mingling in a breath the wedding bell and dirge of death: jest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale, the latest culprit sent to jail; its hue and cry of stolen and lost, its vendue sales and goods at cost, and traffic calling loud for gain. we felt the stir of hall and street, the pulse of life that round us beat; the chill embargo of the snow was melted in the genial glow; wide swung again our ice-locked door, and all the world was ours once more!  clasp, angel of the backword look and folded wings of ashen gray and voice of echoes far away, the brazen covers of thy book; the weird palimpsest old and vast, wherein thou hid’st the spectral past; where, closely mingling, pale and glow the characters of joy and woe; the monographs of outlived years, or smile-illumed or dim with tears, green hills of life that slope to death, and haunts of home, whose vistaed trees shade off to mournful cypresses with the white amaranths underneath. even while i look, i can but heed the restless sands’ incessant fall, importunate hours that hours succeed, each clamorous with its own sharp need, and duty keeping pace with all. shut down and clasp with heavy lids; i hear again the voice that bids the dreamer leave his dream midway for larger hopes and graver fears: life greatens in these later years, the century’s aloe flowers to-day!  yet, haply, in some lull of life, some truce of god which breaks its strife, the worldling’s eyes shall gather dew, dreaming in throngful city ways of winter joys his boyhood knew; and dear and early friends—the few who yet remain—shall pause to view these flemish pictures of old days; sit with me by the homestead hearth, and stretch the hands of memory forth to warm them at the wood-fire’s blaze! and thanks untraced to lips unknown shall greet me like the odors blown from unseen meadows newly mown, or lilies floating in some pond, wood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond; the traveller owns the grateful sense of sweetness near, he knows not whence, and, pausing, takes with forehead bare the benediction of the air.  
NEW POEM
 particulate as ash, new year's first snow falls upon peaked roofs, car hoods, undulant hills, in imitation of motion that moves the way  static cascades down screens when the cable zaps out, persistent &amp; granular with a flicker of legibility that dissipates before it can be  interpolated into any succession of imagery. one hour stretches sixty minutes into a field of white flurry: hexagonal lattices of water  molecules that accumulate in drifts too soon strewn with sand, hewn into browning mounds by plow blade, left to turn to slush.

 love lasts by not lasting  —jack gilbert i’m mapping this new year’s vanishings: lover, yellow house, the knowledge of surfaces. this is not a story of return. there are times i wish i could erase the mind’s lucidity, the difficulty of sundays, my fervor to be touched by a woman two februarys gone. what brings the body back, grieved and cloven, tromping these woods with nothing to confide in? new snow reassumes the circleting trees, the bridge above the creek where i stand like a stranger to my life. there is no single moment of loss, there is an amassing. the disbeliever sleeps at an angle in the bed. the orchard is a graveyard. is this the real end? someone shoveling her way out with cold intention? someone naming her missing?

 afterward, to tell how it was possible to identify absolute space, a matter of great difficulty, keeping in mind always that not all old music is beautiful and therefore it’s necessary to choose. ice loading and unloading as the ice caps wax and wither. brutal and uncouth from the beginning even unto time, space, place, motion.  how are we to obtain true motion? i predict a fiasco—and a fiasco with catcalls. wind circulation in the case of plants, predators in the case of animals, affecting their distribution on the ancient land masses. and who will conduct the chorus and orchestra? many things exist at once.  predilection and preference. begin with the storm. a very agile, beautiful voice. with tremendous temperament. the earth’s magnetic field weakening. even the princess is drawn into the violence of the action, extremes of joy, mad ravings, almost requiring the conventions of opera. thus, thus; we parted, thus to meet again.  thus in a ship, under sail, since the sun itself is moving, supposing infinite space to be (as it were) sensorium of the omnipresent. reduced to a few feet of ground, we begin with great delight to plant a garden. the czar is in that garden. quiet eruptions, safe enough to attract tourists. we suppose other bodies annihilated.  upon any conditions supposed, taught to describe accurately, i detest everything that smells of theory. if we look at similar coral reefs, the past location of the same precise environment can be traced. but there the comparison breaks. and from these relative motions will arise the relative motion of a body on the earth.  
NEW POEM
 don't be misled: that sea-song you hear when the shell's at your ear? it's all in your head.  that primordial tide— the slurp and salt-slosh of the brain's briny wash— is on the inside.  truth be told, the whole place, everything that the eye can take in, to the sky and beyond into space,  lives inside of your skull. when you set your sad head down on procrustes' bed, you lay down the whole  universe. you recline on the pillow: the cosmos grows dim. the soft ghost in the squishy machine,  which the world is, retires. someday it will expire. then all will go silent and dark. for the moment,  however, the black- ness is just temporary. the planet you carry will shortly swing back  from the far nether regions. and life will continue— but only within you. which raises a question  that comes up again and again, as to why god would make ear and eye to face outward, not in?

 how many times should i look at you and should i change my life? monarch you make your orange assent to death.  and how much dexterity  can you really teach me?  does your courage  even map onto these  worldly obligations  to friends, my job, desire  for a little affection in the late  hours of the evening, etc.?   i can't put myself ever  in your head.   but i can lie  on your wing, with my left eye  letting my right dart forward  as you do.   don't ask something  with a lifespan  how to change your life.   ask something you can't  believe ever lived.  
NEW POEM
 what voice is this, thou evening gale! that mingles with thy rising wail; and, as it passes, sadly seems the faint return of youthful dreams?  though now its strain is wild and drear, blithe was it once as sky-lark’s cheer — sweet as the night-bird’s sweetest song, — dear as the lisp of infant’s tongue.  it was the voice, at whose sweet flow the heart did beat, and cheek did glow, and lip did smile, and eye did weep, and motioned love the measure keep.  oft be thy sound, soft gale of even, thus to my wistful fancy given; and, as i list the swelling strain, the dead shall seem to live again!  
NEW POEM
 you shout my name from beyond my dreams, beyond the picture window of this rosarito beach house. rushing from bed to shore i glimpse their backs— volcanoes rising out of the sea. your back, a blue-black silhouette, feet wet with the wash of morning waves. fountains spring from mammal minds, my hands lifting a splash of sand. i'm on my knees, toes finding a cool prayer beneath them, fingers pressing sea foam to my temples, while you open arms wide as a generation, raise them to a compass point, dive. if you could reach them, you would ride their fins under the horizon, then surf the crash of waves left in their wake. and if i could grasp my own fear, i'd drown it, leave it breathless and blue as this ocean, as the brilliant backs of whales surfacing for air.  
NEW POEM
 ah, fading joy, how quickly art thou past! yet we thy ruin haste. as if the cares of human life were few, we seek out new: and follow fate, which would too fast pursue. see how on every bough the birds express in their sweet notes their happiness. they all enjoy and nothing spare; but on their mother nature lay their care. why then should man, the lord of all below, such troubles choose to know as none of all his subjects undergo?  hark, hark, the waters fall, fall, fall, and with a murmuring sound dash, dash upon the ground, to gentle slumbers call.  
NEW POEM
 1  i celebrate myself, and sing myself, and what i assume you shall assume, for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.  i loafe and invite my soul, i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.  my tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air, born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same, i, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin, hoping to cease not till death.  creeds and schools in abeyance, retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten, i harbor for good or bad, i permit to speak at every hazard, nature without check with original energy.  2  houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes, i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it, the distillation would intoxicate me also, but i shall not let it.  the atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless, it is for my mouth forever, i am in love with it, i will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked, i am mad for it to be in contact with me.  the smoke of my own breath, echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine, my respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs, the sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn, the sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind, a few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms, the play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag, the delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides, the feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.  have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much? have you practis’d so long to learn to read? have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?  stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems, you shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,) you shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books, you shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, you shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.  3  i have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end, but i do not talk of the beginning or the end.  there was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now, and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.  urge and urge and urge, always the procreant urge of the world.  out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex, always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.  to elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.  sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams, stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, i and this mystery here we stand.  clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.  lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen, till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.  showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age, knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss i am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.  welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean, not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.  i am satisfied—i see, dance, laugh, sing; as the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread, leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty, shall i postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes, that they turn from gazing after and down the road, and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?  4  trippers and askers surround me, people i meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city i live in, or the nation, the latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new, my dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues, the real or fancied indifference of some man or woman i love, the sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations, battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events; these come to me days and nights and go from me again, but they are not the me myself.  apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am, stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary, looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest, looking with side-curved head curious what will come next, both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.  backward i see in my own days where i sweated through fog with linguists and contenders, i have no mockings or arguments, i witness and wait.  5  i believe in you my soul, the other i am must not abase itself to you, and you must not be abased to the other.  loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat, not words, not music or rhyme i want, not custom or lecture, not even the best, only the lull i like, the hum of your valvèd voice.  i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me, and parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, and reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.  swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth, and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own, and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own, and that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers, and that a kelson of the creation is love, and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields, and brown ants in the little wells beneath them, and mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.  6  a child said what is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands; how could i answer the child? i do not know what it is any more than he.  i guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.  or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord, a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt, bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say whose?  or i guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.  or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, and it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, growing among black folks as among white, kanuck, tuckahoe, congressman, cuff, i give them the same, i receive them the same.  and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.  tenderly will i use you curling grass, it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men, it may be if i had known them i would have loved them, it may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps, and here you are the mothers’ laps.  this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers, darker than the colorless beards of old men, dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.  o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues, and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.  i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women, and the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.  what do you think has become of the young and old men? and what do you think has become of the women and children?  they are alive and well somewhere, the smallest sprout shows there is really no death, and if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it, and ceas’d the moment life appear’d.  all goes onward and outward, nothing collapses, and to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.  7  has any one supposed it lucky to be born? i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and i know it.  i pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots, and peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good, the earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.  i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth, i am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself, (they do not know how immortal, but i know.)  every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female, for me those that have been boys and that love women, for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted, for me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers, for me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears, for me children and the begetters of children.  undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded, i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no, and am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.  8  the little one sleeps in its cradle, i lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.  the youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill, i peeringly view them from the top.  the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom, i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, i note where the pistol has fallen.  the blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders, the heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor, the snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls, the hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs, the flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital, the meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall, the excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd, the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes, what groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits, what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes, what living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum, arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips, i mind them or the show or resonance of them—i come and i depart.  9  the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready, the dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon, the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged, the armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.  i am there, i help, i came stretch’d atop of the load, i felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other, i jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy, and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.  10  alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt, wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee, in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night, kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game, falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.  the yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,  my eyes settle the land, i bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.  the boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me, i tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time; you should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.  i saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl, her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders, on a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand, she had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.  the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside, i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile, through the swung half-door of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak, and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him, and brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet, and gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes, and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness, and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles; he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north, i had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.  11  twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore, twenty-eight young men and all so friendly; twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.  she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank, she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.  which of the young men does she like the best? ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.  where are you off to, lady? for i see you, you splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.  dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather, the rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.  the beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair, little streams pass’d all over their bodies.  an unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies, it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.  the young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them, they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch, they do not think whom they souse with spray.  12  the butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market, i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.  blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil, each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.  from the cinder-strew’d threshold i follow their movements, the lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms, overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure, they do not hasten, each man hits in his place.  13  the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain, the negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece, his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band, his glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead, the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.  i behold the picturesque giant and love him, and i do not stop there, i go with the team also.  in me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing, to niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing, absorbing all to myself and for this song.  oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes? it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life.  my tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble, they rise together, they slowly circle around.  i believe in those wing’d purposes, and acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me, and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional, and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else, and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me, and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.  14  the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night, ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation, the pert may suppose it meaningless, but i listening close, find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.  the sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog, the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats, the brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings, i see in them and myself the same old law.  the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections, they scorn the best i can do to relate them.  i am enamour’d of growing out-doors, of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods, of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses, i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.  what is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is me, me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns, adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me, not asking the sky to come down to my good will, scattering it freely forever.  15  the pure contralto sings in the organ loft, the carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp, the married and unmarried children ride home to their thanksgiving dinner, the pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm, the mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,  the duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches, the deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar, the spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel, the farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a first-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye, the lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case, (he will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;) the jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case, he turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript; the malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table, what is removed drops horribly in a pail; the quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove, the machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass, the young fellow drives the express-wagon, (i love him, though i do not know him;) the half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race, the western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs, out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece; the groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee, as the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle, the bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other, the youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain, the wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the huron, the squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale, the connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways, as the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers, the young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots, the one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child, the clean-hair’d yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill, the paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold, the canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread, the conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him, the child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions, the regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!) the drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray, the pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;) the bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly, the opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips, the prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck, the crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other, (miserable! i do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;) the president holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great secretaries, on the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms, the crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold, the missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle, as the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change, the floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar, in single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers; seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!) seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground; off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface, the stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe, flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees, coon-seekers go through the regions of the red river or through those drain’d by the tennessee, or through those of the arkansas, torches shine in the dark that hangs on the chattahooche or altamahaw,  patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them, in walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport, the city sleeps and the country sleeps, the living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time, the old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife; and these tend inward to me, and i tend outward to them, and such as it is to be of these more or less i am, and of these one and all i weave the song of myself.  16  i am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise, regardless of others, ever regardful of others, maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man, stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine, one of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same, a southerner soon as a northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the oconee i live, a yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth, a kentuckian walking the vale of the elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a louisianian or georgian, a boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a hoosier, badger, buckeye; at home on kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off newfoundland, at home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking, at home on the hills of vermont or in the woods of maine, or the texan ranch, comrade of californians, comrade of free north-westerners, (loving their big proportions,) comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat, a learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest, a novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons, of every hue and caste am i, of every rank and religion, a farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker, prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.  i resist any thing better than my own diversity, breathe the air but leave plenty after me, and am not stuck up, and am in my place.  (the moth and the fish-eggs are in their place, the bright suns i see and the dark suns i cannot see are in their place, the palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)  17  these are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me, if they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing, if they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing, if they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.  this is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is, this the common air that bathes the globe.  18  with music strong i come, with my cornets and my drums, i play not marches for accepted victors only, i play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.  have you heard that it was good to gain the day? i also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.  i beat and pound for the dead, i blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.  vivas to those who have fail’d! and to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! and to those themselves who sank in the sea! and to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes! and the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!  19  this is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger, it is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, i make appointments with all, i will not have a single person slighted or left away, the kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited, the heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited; there shall be no difference between them and the rest.  this is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair, this the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning, this the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face, this the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.  do you guess i have some intricate purpose? well i have, for the fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.  do you take it i would astonish? does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods? do i astonish more than they?  this hour i tell things in confidence, i might not tell everybody, but i will tell you.  20  who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude; how is it i extract strength from the beef i eat?  what is a man anyhow? what am i? what are you?  all i mark as my own you shall offset it with your own, else it were time lost listening to me.  i do not snivel that snivel the world over, that months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.  whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d, i wear my hat as i please indoors or out.  why should i pray? why should i venerate and be ceremonious?  having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close, i find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.  in all people i see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less, and the good or bad i say of myself i say of them.  i know i am solid and sound, to me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, all are written to me, and i must get what the writing means.  i know i am deathless, i know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass, i know i shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.  i know i am august, i do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, i see that the elementary laws never apologize, (i reckon i behave no prouder than the level i plant my house by, after all.)  i exist as i am, that is enough, if no other in the world be aware i sit content, and if each and all be aware i sit content.  one world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself, and whether i come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years, i can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness i can wait.  my foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite, i laugh at what you call dissolution, and i know the amplitude of time.  21  i am the poet of the body and i am the poet of the soul, the pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me, the first i graft and increase upon myself, the latter i translate into a new tongue.  i am the poet of the woman the same as the man, and i say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man, and i say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.  i chant the chant of dilation or pride, we have had ducking and deprecating about enough, i show that size is only development.  have you outstript the rest? are you the president? it is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.  i am he that walks with the tender and growing night, i call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.  press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night! night of south winds—night of the large few stars! still nodding night—mad naked summer night.  smile o voluptuous cool-breath’d earth! earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt! earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue! earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river! earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake! far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth! smile, for your lover comes.  prodigal, you have given me love—therefore i to you give love! o unspeakable passionate love.  22  you sea! i resign myself to you also—i guess what you mean, i behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers, i believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me, we must have a turn together, i undress, hurry me out of sight of the land, cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse, dash me with amorous wet, i can repay you.  sea of stretch’d ground-swells, sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths, sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves, howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea, i am integral with you, i too am of one phase and of all phases.  partaker of influx and efflux i, extoller of hate and conciliation, extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.  i am he attesting sympathy, (shall i make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)  i am not the poet of goodness only, i do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.  what blurt is this about virtue and about vice? evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, i stand indifferent, my gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait, i moisten the roots of all that has grown.  did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy? did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?  i find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance, soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine, thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.  this minute that comes to me over the past decillions, there is no better than it and now.  what behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder, the wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.  23  endless unfolding of words of ages! and mine a word of the modern, the word en-masse.  a word of the faith that never balks, here or henceforward it is all the same to me, i accept time absolutely.  it alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all, that mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.  i accept reality and dare not question it, materialism first and last imbuing.  hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration! fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac, this is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches, these mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas. this is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.  gentlemen, to you the first honors always! your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling, i but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.  less the reminders of properties told my words, and more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication, and make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt, and beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.  24  walt whitman, a kosmos, of manhattan the son, turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding, no sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest.  unscrew the locks from the doors! unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!  whoever degrades another degrades me, and whatever is done or said returns at last to me.  through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.  i speak the pass-word primeval, i give the sign of democracy, by god! i will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.  through me many long dumb voices, voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves, voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs, voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, and of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff, and of the rights of them the others are down upon, of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised, fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.  through me forbidden voices, voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and i remove the veil, voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.  i do not press my fingers across my mouth, i keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart, copulation is no more rank to me than death is.  i believe in the flesh and the appetites, seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.  divine am i inside and out, and i make holy whatever i touch or am touch’d from, the scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer, this head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.  if i worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it, translucent mould of me it shall be you! shaded ledges and rests it shall be you! firm masculine colter it shall be you! whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you! you my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life! breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you! my brain it shall be your occult convolutions! root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you! mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you! trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you! sun so generous it shall be you! vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you! you sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you! winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you! broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you! hands i have taken, face i have kiss’d, mortal i have ever touch’d, it shall be you.  i dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious, each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy, i cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish, nor the cause of the friendship i emit, nor the cause of the friendship i take again.  that i walk up my stoop, i pause to consider if it really be, a morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.  to behold the day-break! the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows, the air tastes good to my palate.  hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding, scooting obliquely high and low.  something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs, seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.  the earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction, the heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head, the mocking taunt, see then whether you shall be master!  25  dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me, if i could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.  we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun, we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.  my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach, with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.  speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself, it provokes me forever, it says sarcastically, walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?  come now i will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation, do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded? waiting in gloom, protected by frost, the dirt receding before my prophetical screams, i underlying causes to balance them at last, my knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things, happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)  my final merit i refuse you, i refuse putting from me what i really am, encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me, i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.  writing and talk do not prove me, i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face, with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic.  26  now i will do nothing but listen, to accrue what i hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.  i hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals, i hear the sound i love, the sound of the human voice, i hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following, sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night, talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals, the angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick, the judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence, the heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters, the ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights, the steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars, the slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two, (they go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)  i hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,) i hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears, it shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.  i hear the chorus, it is a grand opera, ah this indeed is music—this suits me.  a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me, the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.  i hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?) the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies, it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess’d them, it sails me, i dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves, i am cut by bitter and angry hail, i lose my breath, steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,  at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles, and that we call being.  27  to be in any form, what is that? (round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,) if nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.  mine is no callous shell, i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop, they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.  i merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy, to touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as i can stand.  28  is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity, flames and ether making a rush for my veins, treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them, my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself, on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs, straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip, behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, depriving me of my best as for a purpose, unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist, deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields, immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me, no consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger, fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while, then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.  the sentries desert every other part of me, they have left me helpless to a red marauder, they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.  i am given up by traitors, i talk wildly, i have lost my wits, i and nobody else am the greatest traitor, i went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.  you villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat, unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.  29  blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch! did it make you ache so, leaving me?  parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan, rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.  sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital, landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.  30  all truths wait in all things, they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it, they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon, the insignificant is as big to me as any, (what is less or more than a touch?)  logic and sermons never convince, the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.  (only what proves itself to every man and woman is so, only what nobody denies is so.)  a minute and a drop of me settle my brain, i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps, and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman, and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other, and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific, and until one and all shall delight us, and we them.  31  i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars, and the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren, and the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest, and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven, and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery, and the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue, and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.  i find i incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, and am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over, and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons, but call any thing back again when i desire it.  in vain the speeding or shyness, in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach, in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones, in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes, in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low, in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky, in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs, in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods, in vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to labrador, i follow quickly, i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.  32  i think i could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d, i stand and look at them long and long.  they do not sweat and whine about their condition, they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins, they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god, not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things, not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago, not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.  so they show their relations to me and i accept them, they bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.  i wonder where they get those tokens, did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?  myself moving forward then and now and forever, gathering and showing more always and with velocity, infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them, not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers, picking out here one that i love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.  a gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses, head high in the forehead, wide between the ears, limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground, eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.  his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him, his well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.  i but use you a minute, then i resign you, stallion, why do i need your paces when i myself out-gallop them? even as i stand or sit passing faster than you.  33  space and time! now i see it is true, what i guess’d at, what i guess’d when i loaf’d on the grass, what i guess’d while i lay alone in my bed, and again as i walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.  my ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps, i skirt sierras, my palms cover continents, i am afoot with my vision.  by the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen, along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed, weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests, prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase, scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river, where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter, where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish, where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou, where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail; over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field, over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters, over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax, over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest, over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze; scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs, walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush, where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot, where the bat flies in the seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark, where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow, where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides, where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters; where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders, wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs, where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,) where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand, where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it, where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke, where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water, where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents, where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below; where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments, approaching manhattan up by the long-stretching island, under niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance, upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside, upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball, at he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter, at the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw, at apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find, at musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings; where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps, where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel, where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen, where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks, where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie, where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near, where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding, where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh, where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds, where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out, where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery, where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees, where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs, where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon, where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well, through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves, through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs, through the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall; pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old, pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome, pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously, pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church, pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting; looking in at the shop-windows of broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass, wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach, my right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and i in the middle; coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,) far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print, by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient, nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle; voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure, hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any, hot toward one i hate, ready in my madness to knife him, solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while, walking the old hills of judæa with the beautiful gentle god by my side, speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars, speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles, speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest, carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly, storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, backing and filling, appearing and disappearing, i tread day and night such roads.  i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product, and look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.  i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul, my course runs below the soundings of plummets.  i help myself to material and immaterial, no guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.  i anchor my ship for a little while only, my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.  i go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.  i ascend to the foretruck, i take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest, we sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough, through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty, the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions, the white-topt mountains show in the distance, i fling out my fancies toward them, we are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged, we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution, or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city, the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.  i am a free companion, i bivouac by invading watchfires, i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself, i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.  my voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs, they fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.  i understand the large hearts of heroes, the courage of present times and all times, how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and death chasing it up and down the storm, how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights, and chalk’d in large letters on a board,be of good cheer, we will not desert you; how he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up, how he saved the drifting company at last, how the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves, how the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men; all this i swallow, it tastes good, i like it well, it becomes mine, i am the man, i suffer’d, i was there.  the disdain and calmness of martyrs, the mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on, the hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat, the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets, all these i feel or am.  i am the hounded slave, i wince at the bite of the dogs, hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen, i clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin, i fall on the weeds and stones, the riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.  agonies are one of my changes of garments, i do not ask the wounded person how he feels, i myself become the wounded person, my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe.  i am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken, tumbling walls buried me in their debris, heat and smoke i inspired, i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades, i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels, they have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.  i lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake, painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy, white and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps, the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.  distant and dead resuscitate, they show as the dial or move as the hands of me, i am the clock myself.  i am an old artillerist, i tell of my fort’s bombardment, i am there again.  again the long roll of the drummers, again the attacking cannon, mortars, again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.  i take part, i see and hear the whole, the cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots, the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip, workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs, the fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion, the whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.  again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand, he gasps through the clot mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.  34  now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth, (i tell not the fall of alamo, not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo, the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo,) ’tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.  retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks, nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance, their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone, they treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.  they were the glory of the race of rangers, matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship, large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate, bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters, not a single one over thirty years of age.  the second first-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer, the work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.  none obey’d the command to kneel, some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight, a few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together, the maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there, some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away, these were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets, a youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him, the three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.  at eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies; that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.  35  would you hear of an old-time sea-fight? would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? list to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.  our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you, (said he,) his was the surly english pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be; along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.  we closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d, my captain lash’d fast with his own hands.  we had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water, on our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.  fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark, ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported, the master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.  the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.  our frigate takes fire, the other asks if we demand quarter? if our colors are struck and the fighting done?  now i laugh content, for i hear the voice of my little captain, we have not struck, he composedly cries,we have just begun our part of the fighting.  only three guns are in use, one is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast, two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.  the tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top, they hold out bravely during the whole of the action.  not a moment’s cease, the leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.  one of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.  serene stands the little captain, he is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low, his eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.  toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.  36  stretch’d and still lies the midnight, two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness, our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d, the captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet, near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin, the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers, the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below, the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars, cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves, black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent, a few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors, the hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw, wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan, these so, these irretrievable.  37  you laggards there on guard! look to your arms! in at the conquer’d doors they crowd! i am possess’d! embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering, see myself in prison shaped like another man, and feel the dull unintermitted pain.  for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch, it is i let out in the morning and barr’d at night.  not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but i am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side, (i am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)  not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too, and am tried and sentenced.  not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp, my face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.  askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in them, i project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.  38  enough! enough! enough! somehow i have been stunn’d. stand back! give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping, i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.  that i could forget the mockers and insults! that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers! that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.  i remember now, i resume the overstaid fraction, the grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves, corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.  i troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession, inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines, our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth, the blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.  eleves, i salute you! come forward! continue your annotations, continue your questionings.  39  the friendly and flowing savage, who is he? is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?  is he some southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he kanadian? is he from the mississippi country? iowa, oregon, california? the mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?  wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him, they desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.  behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté, slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations, they descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers, they are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.  40  flaunt of the sunshine i need not your bask—lie over! you light surfaces only, i force surfaces and depths also.  earth! you seem to look for something at my hands, say, old top-knot, what do you want?  man or woman, i might tell how i like you, but cannot, and might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot, and might tell that pining i have, that pulse of my nights and days.  behold, i do not give lectures or a little charity, when i give i give myself.  you there, impotent, loose in the knees, open your scarf’d chops till i blow grit within you, spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets, i am not to be denied, i compel, i have stores plenty and to spare, and any thing i have i bestow.  i do not ask who you are, that is not important to me, you can do nothing and be nothing but what i will infold you.  to cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies i lean, on his right cheek i put the family kiss, and in my soul i swear i never will deny him.  on women fit for conception i start bigger and nimbler babes. (this day i am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)  to any one dying, thither i speed and twist the knob of the door. turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed, let the physician and the priest go home.  i seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will, o despairer, here is my neck, by god, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.  i dilate you with tremendous breath, i buoy you up, every room of the house do i fill with an arm’d force, lovers of me, bafflers of graves.  sleep—i and they keep guard all night, not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you, i have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself, and when you rise in the morning you will find what i tell you is so.  41  i am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs, and for strong upright men i bring yet more needed help.  i heard what was said of the universe, heard it and heard it of several thousand years; it is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?  magnifying and applying come i, outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, taking myself the exact dimensions of jehovah, lithographing kronos, zeus his son, and hercules his grandson, buying drafts of osiris, isis, belus, brahma, buddha, in my portfolio placing manito loose, allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved, with odin and the hideous-faced mexitli and every idol and image, taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more, admitting they were alive and did the work of their days, (they bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,) accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman i see, discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house, putting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel, not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation, lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars, minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction, their brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames; by the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born, three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their waists, the snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come, selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery; what was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then, the bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough, dung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d, the supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes, the day getting ready for me when i shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious; by my life-lumps! becoming already a creator, putting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.  42  a call in the midst of the crowd, my own voice, orotund sweeping and final.  come my children, come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates, now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.  easily written loose-finger’d chords—i feel the thrum of your climax and close.  my head slues round on my neck, music rolls, but not from the organ, folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.  ever the hard unsunk ground, ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides, ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real, ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts, ever the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth, ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life, ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.  here and there with dimes on the eyes walking, to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning, tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going, many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving, a few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.  this is the city and i am one of the citizens, whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools, the mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.  the little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats, i am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,) i acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me, what i do and say the same waits for them, every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.  i know perfectly well my own egotism, know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less, and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.  not words of routine this song of mine, but abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring; this printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy? the well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms? the black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and engineers? in the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes? the sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way? the saints and sages in history—but you yourself? sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain, and what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?  43  i do not despise you priests, all time, the world over, my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths, enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern, believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years, waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun, making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis, helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols, dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist, drinking mead from the skull-cup, to shastas and vedas admirant, minding the koran, walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, accepting the gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine, to the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew, ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me, looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land, belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.  one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.  down-hearted doubters dull and excluded, frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical, i know every one of you, i know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.  how the flukes splash! how they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!  be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers, i take my place among you as much as among any, the past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same, and what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.  i do not know what is untried and afterward, but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.  each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.  it cannot fail the young man who died and was buried, nor the young woman who died and was put by his side, nor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again, nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder, nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity, nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in, nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth, nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them, nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.  44  it is time to explain myself—let us stand up.  what is known i strip away, i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown.  the clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?  we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers, there are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.  births have brought us richness and variety, and other births will bring us richness and variety.  i do not call one greater and one smaller, that which fills its period and place is equal to any.  were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister? i am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me, all has been gentle with me, i keep no account with lamentation, (what have i to do with lamentation?)  i am an acme of things accomplish’d, and i an encloser of things to be.  my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs, on every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps, all below duly travel’d, and still i mount and mount.  rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, afar down i see the huge first nothing, i know i was even there, i waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist, and took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.  long i was hugg’d close—long and long.  immense have been the preparations for me, faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.  cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen, for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings, they sent influences to look after what was to hold me.  before i was born out of my mother generations guided me, my embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.  for it the nebula cohered to an orb, the long slow strata piled to rest it on, vast vegetables gave it sustenance, monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.  all forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me, now on this spot i stand with my robust soul.  45  o span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity! o manhood, balanced, florid and full.  my lovers suffocate me, crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night, crying by day ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head, calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, lighting on every moment of my life, bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.  old age superbly rising! o welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!  every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself, and the dark hush promulges as much as any.  i open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems, and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.  wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding, outward and outward and forever outward.  my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels, he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit, and greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.  there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage, if i, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run, we should surely bring up again where we now stand, and surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.  a few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient, they are but parts, any thing is but a part.  see ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that, count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.  my rendezvous is appointed, it is certain, the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms, the great camerado, the lover true for whom i pine will be there.  46  i know i have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.  i tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!) my signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods, no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair, i have no chair, no church, no philosophy, i lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange, but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll, my left hand hooking you round the waist, my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.  not i, not any one else can travel that road for you, you must travel it for yourself.  it is not far, it is within reach, perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know, perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.  shoulder your duds dear son, and i will mine, and let us hasten forth, wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.  if you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip, and in due time you shall repay the same service to me, for after we start we never lie by again.  this day before dawn i ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven, and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then? and my spirit said no, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.  you are also asking me questions and i hear you, i answer that i cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.  sit a while dear son, here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink, but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, i kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.  long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams, now i wash the gum from your eyes, you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.  long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore, now i will you to be a bold swimmer, to jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.  47  i am the teacher of athletes, he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own, he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.  the boy i love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right, wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear, fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak, unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts, first-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo, preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers, and those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.  i teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me? i follow you whoever you are from the present hour, my words itch at your ears till you understand them.  i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat, (it is you talking just as much as myself, i act as the tongue of you, tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)  i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house, and i swear i will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.  if you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore, the nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key, the maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.  no shutter’d room or school can commune with me, but roughs and little children better than they.  the young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well, the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day, the farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice, in vessels that sail my words sail, i go with fishermen and seamen and love them.  the soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine, on the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and i do not fail them, on that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.  my face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket, the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon, the young mother and old mother comprehend me, the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are, they and all would resume what i have told them.  48  i have said that the soul is not more than the body, and i have said that the body is not more than the soul, and nothing, not god, is greater to one than one’s self is, and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud, and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth, and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times, and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero, and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe, and i say to any man or woman, let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.  and i say to mankind, be not curious about god, for i who am curious about each am not curious about god, (no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death.)  i hear and behold god in every object, yet understand god not in the least, nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.  why should i wish to see god better than this day? i see something of god each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then, in the faces of men and women i see god, and in my own face in the glass, i find letters from god dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by god’s name, and i leave them where they are, for i know that wheresoe’er i go, others will punctually come for ever and ever.  49  and as to you death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.  to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes, i see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting, i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors, and mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.  and as to you corpse i think you are good manure, but that does not offend me, i smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing, i reach to the leafy lips, i reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.  and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before.)  i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven, o suns—o grass of graves—o perpetual transfers and promotions, if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing?  of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight, toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck, toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.  i ascend from the moon, i ascend from the night, i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected, and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.  50  there is that in me—i do not know what it is—but i know it is in me.  wrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes, i sleep—i sleep long.  i do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid, it is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.  something it swings on more than the earth i swing on, to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.  perhaps i might tell more. outlines! i plead for my brothers and sisters.  do you see o my brothers and sisters? it is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is happiness.  51  the past and present wilt—i have fill’d them, emptied them, and proceed to fill my next fold of the future.  listener up there! what have you to confide to me? look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening, (talk honestly, no one else hears you, and i stay only a minute longer.)  do i contradict myself? very well then i contradict myself, (i am large, i contain multitudes.)  i concentrate toward them that are nigh, i wait on the door-slab.  who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper? who wishes to walk with me?  will you speak before i am gone? will you prove already too late?  52  the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.  i too am not a bit tamed, i too am untranslatable, i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.  the last scud of day holds back for me, it flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds, it coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.  i depart as air, i shake my white locks at the runaway sun, i effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.  i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love, if you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.  you will hardly know who i am or what i mean, but i shall be good health to you nevertheless, and filter and fibre your blood.  failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged, missing me one place search another, i stop somewhere waiting for you.

 what of the bow? the bow was made in england: of true wood, of yew-wood, the wood of english bows; so men who are free love the old yew-tree and the land where the yew-tree grows.  what of the cord? the cord was made in england: a rough cord, a tough cord, a cord that bowmen love; and so we will sing of the hempen string and the land where the cord was wove.  what of the shaft? the shaft was cut in england: a long shaft, a strong shaft, barbed and trim and true; so we’ll drink all together to the grey goose-feather and the land where the grey goose flew.  what of the mark? ah, seek it not in england, a bold mark, our old mark is waiting over-sea. when the strings harp in chorus, and the lion flag is o’er us, it is there that our mark will be.  what of the men? the men were bred in england: the bowmen—the yeomen, the lads of dale and fell. here’s to you—and to you! to the hearts that are true and the land where the true hearts dwell.

 pour o pour that parting soul in song, o pour it in the sawdust glow of night, into the velvet pine-smoke air tonight, and let the valley carry it along. and let the valley carry it along.  o land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree, so scant of grass, so profligate of pines, now just before an epoch’s sun declines thy son, in time, i have returned to thee. thy son, i have in time returned to thee.  in time, for though the sun is setting on a song-lit race of slaves, it has not set; though late, o soil, it is not too late yet to catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone, leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.  o negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums, squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air, passing, before they stripped the old tree bare one plum was saved for me, one seed becomes  an everlasting song, a singing tree, caroling softly souls of slavery, what they were, and what they are to me, caroling softly souls of slavery.  
NEW POEM
 the wind blew high, the waters raved, a ship drove on the land, a hundred human creatures saved kneel’d down upon the sand. three-score were drown’d, three-score were thrown upon the black rocks wild, and thus among them, left alone, they found one helpless child.  a seaman rough, to shipwreck bred, stood out from all the rest, and gently laid the lonely head upon his honest breast. and travelling o’er the desert wide it was a solemn joy, to see them, ever side by side, the sailor and the boy.  in famine, sickness, hunger, thirst, the two were still but one, until the strong man droop’d the first and felt his labours done. then to a trusty friend he spake, “across the desert wide, o take this poor boy for my sake!” and kiss’d the child and died.  toiling along in weary plight through heavy jungle, mire, these two came later every night to warm them at the fire. until the captain said one day, “o seaman good and kind, to save thyself now come away, and leave the boy behind!”  the child was slumbering near the blaze: “o captain, let him rest until it sinks, when god’s own ways shall teach us what is best!” they watch’d the whiten’d ashy heap, they touch’d the child in vain; they did not leave him there asleep, he never woke again.  
NEW POEM
 ask me no more where jove bestows, when june is past, the fading rose; for in your beauty's orient deep these flowers as in their causes, sleep.  ask me no more whither doth stray the golden atoms of the day; for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair.  ask me no more whither doth haste the nightingale when may is past; for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note.  ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night; for in your eyes they sit, and there, fixed become as in their sphere.  ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest; for unto you at last she flies, and in your fragrant bosom dies.  
NEW POEM
 from fairest creatures we desire increase, that thereby beauty’s rose might never die, but as the riper should by time decease, his tender heir might bear his memory; but thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel, making a famine where abundance lies, thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. though that art now the world’s fresh ornament and only herald to the gaudy spring, within thine own bud buriest thy content, and, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding. pity the world, or else this glutton be, to eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.  
NEW POEM
 i scarcely grieve, o nature! at the lot that pent my life within a city’s bounds, and shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds. perhaps i had not learned, if some lone cot had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth. here, too, o nature! in this haunt of art, thy power is on me, and i own thy thrall. there is no unimpressive spot on earth! the beauty of the stars is over all, and day and darkness visit every hearth. clouds do not scorn us: yonder factory’s smoke looked like a golden mist when morning broke.  
NEW POEM
 i   what is the flesh and blood compounded of but a few moments in the life of time? this prowling of the cells, litigious love, wears the long claw of flesh-arguing crime. consider the first settlers of our bone, observe how busily they sued the dust, estopped forever by the last dusted stone. it is a pity that two brothers must perceive a canker of perennial flower to make them brothers in mortality: perfect this treason to the murderous hour if you would win the hard identity of brothers—a long race for men to run nor quite achieved when the perfection’s won.   ii   near to me as perfection in the blood and more mysterious far, is this, my brother: a light vaulted into your solitude. it studied burns lest you its rage should smother. it is a flame obscure to any eyes, most like the fire that warms the deepest grave (the cold grave is the deepest of our lies) to which our blood is the indentured slave: the fire that burns most secretly in you does not expend you hidden and alone, the studious fire consumes not one, but two— me also, marrowing the self-same bone. our property in fire is death in life flawing the rocky fundament with strife.   iii   then, brother, you would never think me vain or rude, if i should mention dignity; think little of it. dignity’s the stain of mortal sin that knows humility. let me design the hour when you were born since, if that’s vain, it’s only childlike so: like an attempting frost on april corn considerate death would hardly let you go. reckon the cost—if you would validate once more our slavery to circumstance not by contempt of a prescriptive fate but in your bearing towards an hour of chance. it is a part so humble and so proud you’ll think but little of it in your shroud.   iv   the times have changed. why do you make a fuss for privilege when there’s no law of form? who of our kin was pusillanimous, a fine bull galloping into a storm? why, none; unless you count it arrogance to cultivate humility in pride, to look but casually and half-askance on boots and spurs that went a devil’s ride. there was, remember, a virginian who took himself to be brute nature’s law, cared little what men thought him, a tall man who meditated calmly what he saw until he freed his negroes, lest he be too strict with nature and than they less free.   v   our elder brother whom we had not seen these twenty years until you brought him back from the cyclonic west, where he had been sent by the shaking fury in the track we know so well, wound in these arteries: you, other brother, i have become strange to you, and you must study ways to seize mortality, that knows how to derange corpuscles for designs that it may choose; your blood is altered by the sudden death of one who of all persons could not use life half so well as death. let’s look beneath that life. perhaps hers only is our rest— to study this, all lifetime may be best.   vi   the fire i praise was once perduring flame— till it snuffs with our generation out; no matter, it’s all one, it’s but a name not as late honeysuckle half so stout; so think upon it how the fire burns blue, its hottest, when the flame is all but spent; thank god the fuel is low, we’ll not renew that length of flame into our firmament; think too the rooftree crackles and will fall on us, who saw the sacred fury’s height— seated in her tall chair, with the black shawl from head to foot, burning with motherly light more spectral than november dusk could mix with sunset, to blaze on her pale crucifix.   vii   this message hastens lest we both go down scattered, with no character, to death; death is untutored, with an ignorant frown for precious identities of breath. but you perhaps will say confusion stood, a vulture, near the heart of all our kin: i’ve heard the echoes in a dark tangled wood yet never saw i a face peering within. these evils being anonymities, we fulminate, in exile from the earth, aged exclusions of blood memories— those superstitions of explosive birth; until there’ll be of us not anything but foolish death, who is confusion’s king.   viii   not power nor the casual hand of god shall keep us whole in our dissevering air, it is a stink upon this pleasant sod so foul, the hovering buzzard sees it fair; i ask you will it end therefore tonight and the moth tease again the windy flame, or spiders, eating their loves, hide in the night at last, drowsy with self-devouring shame? call it the house of atreus where we live— which one of us the greek perplexed with crime questions the future: bring that lucid sieve to strain the appointed particles of time! whether by corinth or by thebes we go the way is brief, but the fixed doom, not so.   ix   captains of industry, your aimless power awakens harsh velleities of time: let you, brother, captaining your hour be zealous that your numbers are all prime, lest false division with sly mathematic plunder the inner mansion of the blood, the thracian, swollen with pride, besiege the attic— invader foraging the sacred wood: yet the prime secret whose simplicity your towering engine hammers to reduce, though driven, holds that bulwark of the sea which breached will turn unspeaking fury loose to drown out him who swears to rectify infinity, that has nor ear nor eye.  
NEW POEM
 now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost candies the grass, or casts an icy cream upon the silver lake or crystal stream; but the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth, and makes it tender; gives a sacred birth to the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree the drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee. now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring in triumph to the world the youthful spring. the valleys, hills, and woods in rich array welcome the coming of the long'd-for may. now all things smile, only my love doth lour; nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power to melt that marble ice, which still doth hold her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold. the ox, which lately did for shelter fly into the stall, doth now securely lie in open fields; and love no more is made by the fireside, but in the cooler shade amyntas now doth with his chloris sleep under a sycamore, and all things keep time with the season; only she doth carry june in her eyes, in her heart january.  
NEW POEM
 this is the multitude, the beasts you wanted to show me, drawing me upstream, all morning up through wind- scoured heather to the hillcrest. below us, in the next glen, is the grave calm brotherhood, descended out of winter, out of hunger, kneeling like the signatories of a covenant; their weighty, antique-polished antlers rising above the vegetation like masts in a harbor, or city spires. we lie close together, and though the wind whips away our man-and-woman smell, every stag-face seems to look toward us, toward, but not to us: we’re held, and hold them, in civil regard. i suspect you’d hoped to impress me, to lift to my sight our shared country, lead me deeper into what you know, but loath to cause fear you’re already moving quietly away, sure i’ll go with you, as i would now, almost anywhere.  
NEW POEM
 "you know orion always comes up sideways. throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains, and rising on his hands, he looks in on me busy outdoors by lantern-light with something i should have done by daylight, and indeed, after the ground is frozen, i should have done before it froze, and a gust flings a handful of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney to make fun of my way of doing things, or else fun of orion's having caught me. has a man, i should like to ask, no rights these forces are obliged to pay respect to?" so brad mclaughlin mingled reckless talk of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming, till having failed at hugger-mugger farming, he burned his house down for the fire insurance and spent the proceeds on a telescope to satisfy a lifelong curiosity about our place among the infinities.  "what do you want with one of those blame things?" i asked him well beforehand. "don't you get one!"  "don't call it blamed; there isn't anything more blameless in the sense of being less a weapon in our human fight," he said. "i'll have one if i sell my farm to buy it." there where he moved the rocks to plow the ground and plowed between the rocks he couldn't move, few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years trying to sell his farm and then not selling, he burned his house down for the fire insurance and bought the telescope with what it came to. he had been heard to say by several: "the best thing that we're put here for's to see; the strongest thing that's given us to see with's a telescope. someone in every town seems to me owes it to the town to keep one. in littleton it may as well be me." after such loose talk it was no surprise when he did what he did and burned his house down.  mean laughter went about the town that day to let him know we weren't the least imposed on, and he could wait—we'd see to him tomorrow. but the first thing next morning we reflected if one by one we counted people out for the least sin, it wouldn't take us long to get so we had no one left to live with. for to be social is to be forgiving. our thief, the one who does our stealing from us, we don't cut off from coming to church suppers, but what we miss we go to him and ask for. he promptly gives it back, that is if still uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of. it wouldn't do to be too hard on brad about his telescope. beyond the age of being given one for christmas gift, he had to take the best way he knew how to find himself in one. well, all we said was he took a strange thing to be roguish over. some sympathy was wasted on the house, a good old-timer dating back along; but a house isn't sentient; the house didn't feel anything. and if it did, why not regard it as a sacrifice, and an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire, instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?  out of a house and so out of a farm at one stroke (of a match), brad had to turn to earn a living on the concord railroad, as under-ticket-agent at a station where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets, was setting out up track and down, not plants as on a farm, but planets, evening stars that varied in their hue from red to green.  he got a good glass for six hundred dollars. his new job gave him leisure for stargazing. often he bid me come and have a look up the brass barrel, velvet black inside, at a star quaking in the other end. i recollect a night of broken clouds and underfoot snow melted down to ice, and melting further in the wind to mud. bradford and i had out the telescope. we spread our two legs as it spread its three, pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it, and standing at our leisure till the day broke, said some of the best things we ever said. that telescope was christened the star-splitter, because it didn't do a thing but split a star in two or three the way you split a globule of quicksilver in your hand with one stroke of your finger in the middle. it's a star-splitter if there ever was one, and ought to do some good if splitting stars 'sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.  we've looked and looked, but after all where are we? do we know any better where we are, and how it stands between the night tonight and a man with a smoky lantern chimney? how different from the way it ever stood?  
NEW POEM
 you're presenting me with a telescopic line of reasoning. you think because one dies then to die must be a good idea. let me get this straight. so you think to follow suit is what's in the cards and the works and the stars. it may be that's the next step that's clear or it may be there's another way. you may find a friend for whom to die is not the be-all or the end. there were ten rooms and a thousand shelves and ten thousand bottles filled with ten million tickets. you were on the end of the ladder in a blue sky filled with litter. it was tantamount to a ticker tape parade on the streets of a stunned city. staccato ropes couldn't hold you any longer. and in the evening's sudden stillness i breathed in your ear. from now on out everything gets said in a whisper. if you like if you want if you care to come closer. this way is better.  
NEW POEM
 here, in the withered arbor, like the arrested wind, straight sides, carven knees, stands the statue, with hands flung out in alarm or remonstrances.  over the lintel sway the woven bracts of the vine in a pattern of angles. the quill of the fountain falters, woods rake on the sky their brusque tangles.  the birds walk by slowly, circling the marble girl, the golden quails, the pheasants, closed up in their arrowy wings, dragging their sharp tails.  the inquietudes of the sap and of the blood are spent. what is forsaken will rest. but her heel is lifted,—she would flee,—the whistle of the birds fails on her breast.

 our islands are tagaloaalagi’s stepping stones across le vasa loloa small and frail but courageous enough to bear his weight and mana  high enough to keep us above the drowning and learning how to navigate by the stars    currents and the ferocity of storms  point and sail in any direction as long as you know how to return home  you have to navigate the space between the borders of your skin and the intelligence of the tongueless horizon  and learn the language of touch    of signs and pain of what isn’t and what may be in the circle of the tides  that will stretch until you understand the permanent silence at the end of your voyage  and our islands are your anchor and launching site for the universes that repeat and repeat  like the long waves of our ocean    like tagaloaalagi’s compulsive scrutiny of what is to come and fear

 but now it’s raining below the greener clouds of trees that were absorbent but only up to a point. and these raindrops strained by treetops should (you would think) be filtered and finer and therefore pure (and not chinese water torture’s fatter, darker drops that always pick out of all possible bull’s-eyes your bald spot). but these are late, last drops and a little bloated like late, last poems by name your poet.  
NEW POEM
 think of the woman who first touched fire to a hollow stone filled with seal oil, how she fiddled with fuel and flame until blue shadows before and after her filled her house, crowded the underground, then fled like sky-captains chasing the aurora’s whale tale green beyond the earth’s curve. her tenth summer, the elders let her raise her issum, seal pup orphaned when hunters brought in her mother, their grins of plenty broad, red. the women slit the hard belly. plopped among the ruby innards steaming on rough-cut planks blinked a new sea-child whose first sound came out a question in the old language, a question that in one throaty bark asked who, meaning what family is this? what comfort do you provide for guests? do you let strangers remain strangers? the women rinsed the slick pup in cool water, crafted a pouch for her to suck. then the young girl whose hands held light even when the room did not brought this new being beside her bed, let it scatter babiche and split birch gathered for snowshoes, let it nose the caribou neck hairs bearding her dance fans. they held up the fans to their foreheads, playing white hair, playing old. in the time when women do not sew the seal danced at her first potlatch. and when the lamps burned down, no one could see any difference between waves in rock, waves in sea. the pup lifted her nose, licked salt from seven stars, and slipped light back among silvers and chum light among the ghostly belugas swimming far north to offer themselves.

 for rlb pass by the showy rose, blabbing open, suckling a shiny beetle;  pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow—  this love is a lichen,  alga and fungus made one fleck, feeding on what it feeds,  growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace, a double thumbprint,  its bloom distinguishable, with practice, from its dormant phase,  crocheting its singular habit over time, a faithful stain bound to its home,  etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows.

 john-o was given a key to the apartment. the deal was this: if phil died suddenly, and john-o heard, he would rush on over, enter the apartment, leave unseen with phil’s brown suitcase, and secretly pitch it into the mounded deeps of the city dump. simply, there were things that phil didn’t want to hurt his family with. do you have yours? i have mine. the brown suitcase. sasha’s sister, on her deathbed—dinky, frail, just a mild skim-milk trickle of a hospice patient— tensed, sat up, and unloosed such confessional invective that it seemed the walls and the sheets would have to be splattered in shit, her cancer having acted with the harsh, disbursing force of a tornado on the brown and hard-shelled suitcase in her electrochemical memory webs. is yours secure? from love? from sodium pentathol? last year, when a tornado hit our fringe of downtown businesses, the air was alive for counties around with the downward dance of naked canceled checks, handwritten notes, hotel receipts, e-mail transcripts, smeary polaroids, a swirl of lacy underwisps that jellyfished the skies, and from the g-spot shoppe a rain of plastic pleasure aids, of which one prime example pierced a cow between the eyes and struck her dead.  maybe aids—i wasn’t sure. but he was dying, that was sure: as dry as a stick of human chalk, and making the terrible scritch-sound of a stick of chalk, in his throat, in the community air, in the room across from sasha’s sister. something . . .hidden in the trace of rundown aura still around him as we chatted there one morning . . . a tv? a sissyboy tv? i wasn’t sure, but it was obvious his life-chalk held a story not yet written, not confessed yet for this storyniverous planet. and when i remembered my mother’s own last days . . . the way a person is a narrative, the strength of which is either revelation or withholding. it was summer, and the garden at the nursing home was fat with summer’s pleasures: flowered mounds like reefs of coral, bees as globular as whole yolks. in her room, my mother disappeared a breath at a time, and everything else was only a kind of scenery for that. the wink of pollen in the light. the birds. their feather-lice. the bursting spores. those opened-up cicada husks abandoned on the patio —the small, brown, unlocked luggage that’s completed its work in this world.

 1. the letter  everywhere the windows give up nothing but frost’s intricate veined foliage. just engines shrilling pocked and frozen streets wailing toward some new disaster. no bright angels’ ladders going to split heaven this chicago instant where the pier’s an iced fantastic: spiked, the glacial floes seize it greedy like a careless treasure—  marquise diamonds, these round clear globes, the psychic’s crystal world spinning in her corner shop when i passed, a globe boundaried with turning silent winds and demons. out here the pavement’s a slick graffitied strip:there’s more to life than violence.

 last summer, two discrete young snakes left their skin on my small porch, two mornings in a row. being  postmodern now, i pretended as if i did not see them, nor understand what i knew to be circling  inside me. instead, every hour i told my son to stop with his incessant back-chat. i peeled  a banana. and cursed god—his arrogance, his gall—to still expect our devotion  after creating love. and mosquitoes. i showed my son the papery dead skins so he could  know, too, what it feels like when something shows up at your door—twice—telling you what you already know.

 the squirrels are spreading the rumor: no more monkey business. the dow jones hops up, then down, then back up, trying for attention, up against dog days. the capitol dome rattles like a witch doctor's gourd. “more republicans,” warn the talking drums. the networks labor underground to stockpile t, a, and blood capsules for sweeps week, when all hell won’t be enough to save some. pedestrians slip into light coats of pollen and mold spores. the enquirer reports the sighting of satan's image over chicago during the heat emergency. his words were, “for the hottest deals in town, see sal at mutto's chevrolet on east wacker.” the old elms shrug: “you think this is hot: we could tell you about hot.” walmart and kmart burgeon into crooked towers of back-to-school candy. they're heaven-bound, via the moon. greeters offer themselves to the lowest common denominator. there's a blue- light on moon caps. representatives from tire city have announced they intend a hostile takeover and cleansing of their former territory, now known as carpet city. furniture city will not intervene. the nfl’s negotiating for rights to the baptist church. the carnies have packed up the tilt-a-whirl and ferris wheel, leaving us up to our ass in free parking. everyone under 30 dreams of shoplifting some air jordans for school. everyone over 30 dreams of going to prison for shoplifting. the hypochondriacs wake up noticing little dark spots in front of their eyes, think they could be in the middle of something serious. “winterize now,” say the prime-time commercials. “spend, spend, spend!” cry the cicadas and katydids over the scorched, moonlit lawns.

 i wanted to see where beauty comes from without you in the world, hauling my heart across sixty acres of northeast meadow, my pockets filling with flowers. then i remembered, it’s you i miss in the brightness and body of every living name: rattlebox, yarrow, wild vetch. you are the green wonder of june, root and quasar, the thirst for salt. when i finally understand that people fail at love, what is left but cinquefoil, thistle, the paper wings of the dragonfly aeroplaning the soul with a sudden blue hilarity? if i get the story right, desire is continuous, equatorial. there is still so much i want to know: what you believe can never be removed from us, what you dreamed on walnut street in the unanswerable dark of your childhood, learning pleasure on your own. tell me our story: are we impetuous, are we kind to each other, do we surrender to what the mind cannot think past? where is the evidence i will learn to be good at loving? the black dog orbits the horseshoe pond for treefrogs in their plangent emergencies. there are violet hills, there is the covenant of duskbirds. the moon comes over the mountain like a big peach, and i want to tell you what i couldn’t say the night we rushed north, how i love the seriousness of your fingers and the way you go into yourself, calling my half-name like a secret. i stand between taproot and treespire. here is the compass rose to help me live through this. here are twelve ways of knowing what blooms even in the blindness of such longing. yellow oxeye, viper’s bugloss with its set of pink arms pleading do not forget me. we hunger for eloquence. we measure the isopleths. i am visiting my life with reckless plenitude. the air is fragrant with tiny strawberries. fireflies turn on their electric wills: an effulgence. let me come back whole, let me remember how to touch you before it is too late.  
NEW POEM
 i saw an eagle sweep to the sky— the godlike! – seeking his place on high, with a strong, and wild, and rapid wing— a dark, and yet a dazzling thing; and his arching neck, his bristling crest, and the dark plumes quivering upon his breast; and his eye, bent up to each beam of light, like a bright sword flash’d with a sword in fight.  i saw him rise o’er the forest trees; i saw his pinion ride the breeze; beyond the clouds i watched him tower on his path of pride – his flight of power. i watched him wheeling, stern and lone, where the keenest ray of the sun was thrown; soaring, circling – bathed in light: such was that desert eagle’s flight.  suddenly, then, to my straining eye, i saw the strong wing slack on high; falling, falling to earth once more; the dark breast covered with foam and gore; the dark eyes’ glory dim with pain; sick to death with a sun-struck brain! reeling down from that height divine, eagle of heaven! such fall was thine!  even so we see the sons of light, up to the day-beam steer their flight; and the wing of genius cleaves the sky, as the clouds rush on when the winds are high: then comes the hour of sudden dread— then is the blasting sunlight shed; and the gifted fall in their agony, sund-struck eagle! to die like thee!  
NEW POEM
 the only reality is the perpetual flow of vital energy. —montale spindrift, crustacean patience and a gust of ozone, you come back once more to this dazzling shore, its warm uterine rinse, heart-racing heave and groan.  a quick gasp as you slip into the hissing wash, star cluster, dulse and kelp, slick algae, spittle, froth, the intimate slash and dash, hard-packed in the seething broth.  soft water-lip, soft hand, close tug of origin, the sensual writhe and snore of maidenhair and frond, you swim here once more smart as a rogue gene.  spirits of lake, river and woodland pond preside mildly in water never troubled by wind or tide; and the quiet suburban pool is only for the fearful —  no wind-wave energies where no sea briar grips and no freak breaker with the violence of the ages comes foaming at the mouth to drown you in its depths.  among pebbles a white conch worn by the suck and crunch, a sandy skull as old as the centuries, in cold and solitude reclines where the moon-magnet shines;  but today you swirl and spin in sea water as if, creatures of salt and slime and naked under the sun, life were a waking dream and this the only life.

 imagine that — my last words might have been spoken to the dog, she who saved my life, it has been said, spoken with no thought of reply nor of understanding, a genial insult maybe, a philosophical conundrum posed aeons before any household pet ever turned an ear. in the ambulance i made no remark about trees nor how tired i was of them, and in the second ambulance our dog’s heart beat hard with terror.  
NEW POEM
 it was a flower once, it was one of a billion flowers whose perfume broke through closed car windows, forced a blessing on their drivers. then what stayed behind grew swollen, as we do; grew juice instead of tears, and small hard sour seeds, each one bitter, as we are, and filled with possibility. now a hole opens up in its skin, where it was torn from the branch; ripeness can’t stop itself, breathes out; we can’t stop it either. we breathe in.  
NEW POEM
 (excerpt) ’tis morning; and the sun with ruddy orb ascending, fires the horizon: while the clouds that crowd away before the driving wind, more ardent as the disk emerges more, resemble most some city in a blaze, seen through the leafless wood.  his slanting ray slides ineffectual down the snowy vale, and tinging all with his own rosy hue, from ev’ry herb and ev’ry spiry blade stretches a length of shadow o’er the field. mine, spindling into longitude immense, in spite of gravity, and sage remark that i myself am but a fleeting shade, provokes me to a smile.  with eye askance i view the muscular proportion’d limb transform’d to a lean shank.  the shapeless pair, as they design’d to mock me, at my side take step for step; and as i near approach the cottage, walk along the plaster’d wall, prepost’rous sight! the legs without the man. the verdure of the plain lies buried deep beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents, and coarser grass upspearing o’er the rest, of late unsightly and unseen, now shine conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad, and fledg’d with icy feathers, nod superb. the cattle mourn in corners where the fence screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep in unrecumbent sadness.  there they wait their wonted fodder; not like hung’ring man fretful if unsupply’d, but silent, meek, and patient of the slow-pac’d swain’s delay. he from the stack carves out th’ accustom’d load, deep-plunging, and again deep plunging oft his broad keen knife into the solid mass; smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands, with such undeviating and even force he severs it away: no needless care lest storms should overset the leaning pile deciduous, or its own unbalanc’d weight.  . . .  ’tis liberty alone that gives the flow’r of fleeting life its lustre and perfume, and we are weeds without it.  all constraint, except what wisdom lays on evil men, is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes their progress in the road of science; blinds the eyesight of discov’ry, and begets, in those that suffer it, a sordid mind bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit to be the tenant of man’s noble form. thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art, with all thy loss of empire, and though squeez’d by public exigence till annual food fails for the craving hunger of the state, thee i account still happy, and the chief among the nations, seeing thou art free! my native nook of earth!  . . .  but there is yet a liberty unsung by poets, and by senators unprais’d, which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the powers of earth and hell confed’rate take away. a liberty, which persecution, fraud, oppression, prisons, have no pow’r to bind, which whoso tastes can be enslav’d no more. ’tis liberty of heart, deriv’d from heav’n, bought with his blood who gave it to mankind, and seal’d with the same token.  it is held by charter, and that charter sanction’d sure by th’ unimpeachable and awful oath and promise of a god.  his other gifts all bear the royal stamp that speaks them his, and are august, but this transcends them all.

NEW POEM
 in the old neighborhood, each funeral parlor is more elaborate than the last. the alleys smell of cops, pistols bumping their thighs, each chamber steeled with a slim blue bullet.  low-rent balconies stacked to the sky. a boy plays tic-tac-toe on a moon crossed by tv antennae, dreams  he has swallowed a blue bean. it takes root in his gut, sprouts and twines upward, the vines curling around the sockets and locking them shut.  and this sky, knotting like a dark tie? the patroller, disinterested, holds all the beans.  august. the mums nod past, each a prickly heart on a sleeve.

 and then came the ten moons full in the sun’s glare, and the seraphim, and it was light all night in the orchards and on the plains and even in the towns and mankind rejoiced, because it was now the case that the wrecking and equivocating could carry on the pale night long. mankind rejoiced and went forth to those places twelve hours of light had not made it worth the while to despoil and gamboled collectively on the cliff tops and regarded the night-broiling of the sea hitherto forbidden, but now opened in festival. half the world’s time unpeeled and exposed so fruit might ripen faster and trees flourish higher and forced photosynthesis green all the land. then night ramblers, night-sun-worshippers, night-motorists fanned out and made the most of spectral light, which bleached out stars and even the cozy old moon herself, who had once held a sickle broadside to the sun, and now was a hollow daytime shadow. only a few old believers slept hand in hand, shoulder to breast, as if their lives depended on it, knowing yet that the morning would bring nothing because the day knew no beginning and had no end.  
NEW POEM
 the deep evening-colored rose of the sea is closing. sweet crude oil, orange as rust, finds an open pathway into the marsh. and what you thought would be your home, lush with grasses, is no home, drives you out into the gray-glazed gates of sleep. blood flowers where we don’t see it. and every chance event is a high note racing from stars in sea-depths of brightness, and every shock we feel we feel only with the slack ropes of our arms. someone wants to hide the body of oil and cannot. someone wants to hide their hands from shame. shark, dolphin, manatee, fish, each slick skin an undreamt tine threading its red flute-dusk through fumes. sound of the flood-dark pulse. then the second when the water makes no sound.     the old vandals were floods and boats eroding the banks. the islands that once dotted the bays have sunk, disappearing into silverish grit, thinned into algae and filament now being made quiet by plumes. despite ourselves we are made quiet. the death of the sea a thing we must lower ourselves into to imagine. i will stay with you here inside the sheen of orange that quickly kills, not like the saltwater slowly starving the freshwater- marshes and grasses that knit this green-wet world together. the two breathless gannets found covered in oil are not unlike you, at the mercy of a mercy that moves in plumes, that insists certain fates remain invisible. what existed before the oil arrived was delicate and mired, a broom of moonlight swept through half-choked waves. i trust you if you wish for what it, too, might have been.     leading into the bay are soft green expanses of grasses, saltwater channels, slicks not glimpsed here before. the birds bathe where they can, in half-damp shadows that make possible the next free climb into air. there is nothing beyond our means to feel it— oil pushing up to the surface where the surface-dwellers die, turtles pulling in from the gulf for nesting. if i close my eyes i can hear the faint blue traces of blood over-gathered by oil and the sound of ice near the seafloor.  there will be a time when nothing living moves, a degradation of stillness beyond any liquid scar. still, the solutions of despair are weak if you believe you can touch an undersea reef, the belly of a small wounded whale. you have the power to feel it. the breath of the animal moving like trust into your arms.     before the hour when the coast slid into ocean we thought we saw a patch of sun greening in waves. the slip of a fish. there was a need so deep in our bodies we could not even weep. we called for an end and that end did not come. power after power, our machine tools and cutting tools did nothing to hold back the brown clouds rippling in chaotic columns toward the light. and what the skies mean, passing over beds of tarred seaweed, feels unutterable, like the darkness around a candle. where had we hoped to live? you came into the month with dreams. you walked on those beaches even though you knew they were sick. the bird that sought the reeds to die in, the fish gill-soaked with oils— you gathered them into yourself as if you alone could bring back their flickering. and overhead the novae exploded toward you along tracks of gas and dust, and the fields of ocean rose into you, and the crabs broke from their cancer fossils in masses of tiny flowers and you felt inside you the islands re-arise, flushed from the thickening imbalance of the earth. (is there some refuge beyond ourselves that is vast enough? the sea is without grief. as are the days.)

 for a long time, the lotion stigma swirled on the man who clothes me with a broken  world. i came when they called me. that cotton rubbed me the wrong way all the   way inside over the course of time. way before cotton sewn into the coat of the one who clothes me. before i started clothing  them with paper. before cotton sewn into   their coats they curled up on flat boats all the way back up the country. the beaded strips of leather and cotton made me come to myself when he called me and wrote me   on the one who clothes me. pour some water on me. make coming matter cut and twirl  on me. the law of emulsion is always broke on me. somebody pour some beautiful jute  on me. let her blow some horn on me. the man who clothes me in my skin is gonna write  on me. your writing moves to stop on me.  someday they’re gonna curve this on a pearl   on me but now it’s time to go and i can’t wait to get up out from here. it’s simple to stay furled  where you can’t live. for a long, long time i’ve  been wearing this other planet like a scar on me.

 there was this bear cam on the internet. it was pointed at a place called katmai national park, alaska. a few years ago my friend sent me a link to it. i would watch it sometimes but i never saw any bears. maybe it was bad luck because my friend said she saw bears. all i ever saw was the enormous river rushing and the tall pines in the background doing nothing. i mean, that was ok, of course. i loved the sound of the river and wind in trees and the sheer thrill that such a sublime nothingness could be witnessed like this.  but i wanted to see a bear. it seemed even more thrilling to be typing in a cubicle and suddenly out of nowhere there’s a bear on your screen that maybe 50 other people in the world catch a glimpse of. maybe they are on a break from facebook or filling out a spreadsheet and boom, a bear.  so i thought while i was writing this that i would just check the bear cam online and sure enough a fat bear is in the middle of the river eating a salmon right there in the katmai national park. i get up from my desk and tell my colleagues “you guys, come here!” and my colleagues come in my office but by the time they run in the bear crosses the river, or pixelated screen or whatever, salmon in his jaws and the only thing there is the river and trees and they say, “sandra, this is boring,” and walk back to their own offices.  
NEW POEM
 from sonnets, third series   iv  thin little leaves of wood fern, ribbed and toothed, long curved sail needles of the green pitch pine, with common sandgrass, skirt the horizon line, and over these the incorruptible blue! here let me gently lie and softly view all world asperities, lightly touched and smoothed as by his gracious hand, the great bestower. what though the year be late? some colors run yet through the dry, some links of melody. still let me be, by such, assuaged and soothed and happier made, as when, our schoolday done, we hunted on from flower to frosty flower, tattered and dim, the last red butterfly, or the old grasshopper molasses-mouthed.

 heartworn happiness, fine line that winds among the tapestry’s old blacks and blues, bright hair blazing in the theater, red hair raving in the bar—as now the little leaves shoot veils of gold across the trees’ bones, shroud of spring, ghost of summer, shadblow snow, blood- russet spoor spilled prodigal on last year’s leaves . . . when your yellows, greens, and yellow-greens, your ochres and your umbers have evolved nearly to hemlock blackness, cypress blackness, when the woods are rife with soddenness (unfolded ferns, skunk cabbage by the stream, barberry by the trunks, and bitter watercress inside the druid pool) will your thin, still-glinting thread insist to catch the eye in filigreed titrations stitched along among beneath the branches, in the branches where it lives all winter, occulted fire, brief constant fleeting gold . . .

 three flies, woken by the sun on a white, illuminated wall, leap like the hands of a florist wrapping bouquets. they remind me of a knife thrower, who performs with five in the air. is the quantity restricted? catch and don’t think. weigh me. i’ll run away from you like water and press you like ice if you sizzle too much. look at them on the white wall. three trees from the new shoots of a cedar. from the corner of a cube. and, if you look closely, from a gully.   translated from the slovenian

 a second crop of hay lies cut and turned. five gleaming crows search and peck between the rows. they make a low, companionable squawk, and like midwives and undertakers possess a weird authority.  crickets leap from the stubble, parting before me like the red sea. the garden sprawls and spoils.  across the lake the campers have learned to water ski. they have, or they haven’t. sounds of the instructor’s megaphone suffuse the hazy air. “relax! relax!”  cloud shadows rush over drying hay, fences, dusty lane, and railroad ravine. the first yellowing fronds of goldenrod brighten the margins of the woods.  schoolbooks, carpools, pleated skirts; water, silver-still, and a vee of geese.  *  the cicada’s dry monotony breaks over me. the days are bright and free, bright and free.  then why did i cry today for an hour, with my whole body, the way babies cry?  *  a white, indifferent morning sky, and a crow, hectoring from its nest high in the hemlock, a nest as big as a laundry basket ... in my childhood i stood under a dripping oak, while autumnal fog eddied around my feet, waiting for the school bus with a dread that took my breath away.  the damp dirt road gave off this same complex organic scent.  i had the new books—words, numbers, and operations with numbers i did not comprehend—and crayons, unspoiled by use, in a blue canvas satchel with red leather straps.  spruce, inadequate, and alien i stood at the side of the road. it was the only life i had.

 at the hour the streetlights come on, buildings turn abstract. the hudson, for a moment, formal. we drink bourbon on the terrace and you speak in the evening voice, weighted deep in the throat.  they plan to harvest oysters, you tell me, from the harbor by jersey city, how the waters will be clean again in twenty years. i imagine nets burdened with rough shells, the meat dun and sexual.  below, the river and the high rock where boys each year jump from bravado or desperation. the day flares, turns into itself. and innocently, sideways, the way we always fall  into grace or knowledge, we watched the police drag the river for a suicide, the third this year. the terrible hook, the boy’s frail whiteness. his face was blank and new as your face  in the morning before the day has worked its pattern of lines and tensions. a hook like an iron question and this coming out of the waters, a flawed pearl—  a memory that wasn’t ours to claim. perhaps, in a bedroom by lamplight, a woman waits for this boy. she may riffle drawers gathering photographs, string, keys to abandoned rooms.  even now she may be leaving, closing the door for some silence. i need to move next to you. water sluiced from the boy’s hair. i need to watch you  light your cigarette, the flickering of your face in matchlight, as if underwater, drifting away. i take your cigarette and drag from it, touch your hand.  remember that winter of your long fever, the winter we understood how fragile any being together was. the wall sweated behind the headboard and you said you felt  the rim where dreams crouch and every room of the past. it must begin in luxury— do you think—a break and fall into the glamour attending each kind of surrender. water must flood  the mind, as in certain diseases, the walls between the cells of memory dissolve, blur into a single stream of voices and faces. i don’t know any more about this river or if  it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories— a tide of voices. and this is how the dead rise to us, transformed: wet and singing, the tide of voices pearling in our hands.  
NEW POEM
 the tide rises, the tide falls, the twilight darkens, the curlew calls; along the sea-sands damp and brown the traveller hastens toward the town, and the tide rises, the tide falls.  darkness settles on roofs and walls, but the sea, the sea in the darkness calls; the little waves, with their soft, white hands, efface the footprints in the sands, and the tide rises, the tide falls.  the morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls; the day returns, but nevermore returns the traveller to the shore, and the tide rises, the tide falls.

 it takes more than a wish to catch a fish you take the hook you add the bait you concentrate and then you wait you wait     you wait but not a bite the fish don’t have an appetite so tell them what good bait you’ve got and how your bait can hit the spot this works a whole lot better than a wish if you really want to catch a fish

 you’ve planted and weeded and wheelbarrowed, now tapping a pencil, trying to remember the next thing—what was it?—when a shape drops from the sky, shudders and stops at a tree—red blotch—whack, whack. a creature big enough on this slow spring day to make you mutter,  
NEW POEM
 no more savage art: filleting: a deft pressure along the backbone  from tail fan to the red gills: fighting mystery with a honed blade  through the small bones: salt and scales on face and hands:: the greek god,  as well, found flesh unmysterious, but in anger and disappointment:—  seagull cries, your music, are all about you: apollonian but hungrier: nature is hungry::  the brave fish dies the birds swoop for the insides in no lovelier spirals.

 (the way bed is in winter, like an aproned lap, like furry mittens, like childhood crouching under tables) the ninth day of xmas, in the morning black outside our window: clattering cans, the whir of a hopper, shouts, a whistle,move on... i see them in my warm imagination the way i’ll see them later in the cold, heaving the huge cans and running (running!) to the next house on the street.  my vestiges of muscle stir uneasily in their percale cocoon: what moves those men out there, what drives them running to the next house and the next? halfway back to dream, i speculate: the social weal? “let’s make good old bloomington a cleaner place to live in—right, men?hup, tha!” healthy competition? “come on, boys, let’s burn up that route today and beat those dudes on truck thirteen!” enlightened self-interest? “another can, another dollar—don’t slow down, mac, i’m puttin’ three kids through princeton?” or something else? terror?  a half hour later, dawn comes edging over clark street: layers of color, laid out like a flattened rainbow—red, then yellow, green, and over that the black-and-blue of night still hanging on. clark street maples wave their silhouettes against the red, and through the twiggy trees, i see a solid chunk of garbage truck, and stick-figures of men, like windup toys, tossing little cans— and running.  all day they’ll go like that, till dark again, and all day, people fussing at their desks, at hot stoves, at machines, will jettison tin cans, bare evergreens, damp kleenex, all things that are caesar’s.  o garbage men, the new year greets you like the old; after this first run you too may rest in beds like great warm aproned laps and know that people everywhere have faith: putting from them all things of this world, they confidently bide your second coming.

 past fences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processions of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing point like fretboards carrying barbed melodies, windharp narratives, songs of place, i’m thinking of the long cowboy ballads ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught me the ends if he could have remembered them. but remembering was years ago when ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day and found, and played guitar in a saturday night band, and now he is dead and i’m remembering near the end when he just needed a drink before he could tie his shoes. we’d stay up all night playing the beginnings of songs like falling leaf, about a girl who died of grief, and zebra dun, about a horse that pawed the light out of the moon. sometimes ray would break through and recall a few more verses before he’d drop a line or scramble a rhyme or just go blank, and his workfat hands would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief. between songs he’d pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that sounded like nails in a paper bag. done, he’d straighten and say,my cough’s not just right, i need another cigarette, and light the parliament he bit at an upward angle like roosevelt and play the start of another song. then, played out and drunk enough to go home, he’d pick up his hat and case and make it, usually on the second try, through the front gate and gently list out into the early morning dark, beginning again some song without end, yodeling his vote under spangles.

 we hadn’t got color up till then. and if i had a nickel, why, that was for milk. milk money: the money a body gained. was just me on that hillside and the kite, red &amp; white waked up into the wind. hardly anybody knew me then. oh, lord how quickly the things of this world came and went. practically the first thing i notice when i get back. wind, and i am lifted. wind and i am hauled ahead by string and air. the bows sinuate the air, i hear them tatter.  a certain kindness to that hill, its slope gone gaily green against the eve and oh, the tail dipped; the string slipped. uppity huff and drag of hawk air plundering eggs in the sparrow’s nest. you left this fragment, this bit of shell behind.

 i cannot know twisted henriette of the plant kingdom engrafted with a crutch. and yet her bulbous concerns effuse a solid blue from inside, like a steel dryad, and her gaze effaced  shines with distended power. otherwise these clusterjewels would not dazzle us so, as limbs proliferate through her pulped brain from dendrites where creation flared  and this crippled tree would seem defaced, j’accuse! beneath the lace of this clipped sister and would not glisten in synaptic blasts  would not, from all the reaching boughs of self, burst like ripe sapphires:for here there is no place that does not see you. you shake forth a nest.

 the stars   the nights midweek are secrets kept. no soul on site, no signal/bars, and zilch for company except a zillion bright disarming stars.  i’ll flit through ambers, quicker, higher. i’ll break each hamlet’s stop or yield.  i’ll fix some noodles, start a fire and climb up to the topmost field.  the stars at first are sparse, unclear. they surface in that drag between the darkened grass and stratosphere, of powder blue and bottle green.  they blossom, thick and fast, in droves. they pulse, in clusters, magnify. the smoke that’s my potbelly stove’s frays outwards through each needle eye.  i’ll head below. i’ll char till dawn some apple logs down to their core. by pewter light when stars have gone, i’ll do a bit, a little more.    the rain   you live inside its sound effects whole weeks on end: its pin machine, its cardboard drum, its soft-boiled eggs, its silent running submarine.  it’s like the god of liquid rub- ber stirred at dawn to slip downstairs and sip a cigarette, to drub his fingertips on solid layers  you poured across last summer’s drought. you love it, learn to, as it slows, and even as you come to doubt its dribs and drabs and pigeon toes.  forget the welcome rain outstayed. for days the leaves are parchment sheet and wind hangs chimeless in the shade. still rain remains the point of heat.  the rain is near. like everything, it’s best those seconds just before: the broadleaf ’s backwards canvas sling, the fly strip flapping through the door.    the wind   the wind’s this ancient bloke below who chunters “we,” who wheezes “us,” though no one else will come or go. you want to ask the wind “who’s us?”  but hold your tongue till, in your head, the wind and him have somehow mixed, the type of wind that loves a shed and banging on of things not fixed:  a belt-and-braces year-round wind, a kiln-dried cobwebbed hardwood wind, a greenhouse wind, a treebound wind, an end-of-season car-boot wind,  a padlocked shower unit wind, an upturned wheelie dumpster wind, a channel not quite tuned-in wind, a hollow flight-path thunder wind,  a dog-eared wind, a knocked-sign wind, a spouseless phantom ocean-blown autumnal graveyard scots pine wind who speaks in plurals, moves alone.    the grass   one night last june, in cups, in love with pickled gin from bubbly flutes, our clothes in coils about the stove, we climbed the dark in birthday suits.  it’s true! the grass was mown that day. like hippies chained in meadow flowers, we tripped above the cut and lay in blades of petrol suede for hours.  we listened to the lowing black. we giggled, kissed. we possumed dead. we woke as flesh and straggled back like beasts for parlor, dressed, then read.  we trafficked grass in bedspreads, shoes, and never spoke of that again through winter’s interregnum blues, of being spooked by skin, of when  the only care we had was grass, the only stir for miles around our freezing bones, our clinking glass, our dying to be rumbled, found.

 it is foolish to let a young redwood grow next to a house.  even in this one lifetime, you will have to choose.  that great calm being, this clutter of soup pots and books—  already the first branch-tips brush at the window. softly, calmly, immensity taps at your life.

 i  how can we accommodate these reforms? the nights of bell-flowers are as finished as the hell of water that has unrolled and become news. pull at the ox’s ring and the wall of the sinuses falls down. pull at the hoop in the eyelid, dormitories are felled. a marriage of fists and kites, the smile is hammered so painstakingly into the gut it forms a ring.  ii  i am staring up at a boxing match in which white everlasts and red everlasts take on the breakneck speed of cupids. art deco façades hem in the open-air courtyard; a black belt of skyline circles off their incandescent white waists. the sunrise pulls level with the sea. the boxers’ shadows furl and unfurl, drawing into cups.  iii  you open your heart’s wings like a bread riot, split the uncooked potatoes on the table with a glance, and eat. you make the hours work like fragile perceptions for the food they get, the warmth they get, for the variable, contradictory spontaneities imposed on their bodies as love or triumph in mistaken assertions.

 they've been so long above it all, those two petals so steeped in style they seem to stall in the kettle  simmering over the town dump or, better still, the neon-flashed, x-rated rump of fresh roadkill  courtesy of the interstate that eisenhower would overtake in the home straight by one horsepower,  the kettle where it all boils down to the thick scent of death, a scent of such renown it's given vent  to the idea buzzards can spot a deer carcass a mile away, smelling the rot as, once, marcus  aurelius wrinkled his nose at a gas leak from the great sewer that ran through rome to the tiber  then went searching out, through the gloam, one subscriber to the other view that the rose, full-blown, antique,  its no-frills ruff, the six-foot shrug of its swing-wings, the theologian's and the thug's twin triumphings  in a buzzard's shaved head and snood, buzz-buzz-buzzy, its logic in all likelihood somewhat fuzzy,  would ever come into focus, it ever deign to dispense its hocus-pocus in that same vein  as runs along an inner thigh to where, too right, the buzzard vouchsafes not to shy away from shite,  its mission not to give a miss to a bête noire, all roly-poly, full of piss and vinegar,  trying rather to get to grips with the grommet of the gut, setting its tinsnips to that grommet  in the spray-painted hind's hindgut and making a sweeping, too right, a sweeping cut that's so blasé  it's hard to imagine, dear sis, why others shrink from this sight of a soul in bliss, so in the pink  from another month in the red of the shambles, like a rose in over its head among brambles,  unflappable in its belief it's ararat on which the ark would come to grief, abjuring that  marcus aurelius humbug about what springs from earth succumbing to the tug at its heartstrings,  reported to live past fifty, as you yet may, dear sis, perhaps growing your hair in requital,  though briefly, of whatever tears at your vitals, learning, perhaps, from the nifty, nay thrifty, way  these buzzards are given to stoop and take their ease by letting their time-chastened poop fall to their knees  till they're almost as bright with lime as their night roost, their poop containing an enzyme that's known to boost  their immune systems, should they prong themselves on small bones in a cerebral cortex, at no small cost  to their well-being, sinking fast in a deer crypt, buzzards getting the hang at last of being stripped  of their command of the vortex while having lost their common touch, they've been so long above it all.  
NEW POEM
 the song is gaelic now, peridot words the color of fresh timothy gathered by red-haired women; or the song is the bony white oak and rhythm of miwu, a knowing that breathes against angles of granite and meets the ground in a flurry of sound. or the song rides down from a star over burgundy boulders beneath a dazzling blue sky to find the old words buried deep in the earth.  but this heart listens. this song.hi-tsah-tsi-nah, the precious rain awakening.  on this you come as a prayer in the flesh, on this you ride with the roll and rollick of rattlesnake. on this you sing volcanic birthing words and obsidian cools where the blood bubbles down.  oh look, a little girl is lost although she stands close to her mother’s heart. with great energy she scrapes the missionaries from her ribs. shoulder blades curve around the spine and the pestle dances, acorns flying, and dust collects in the creases of her hands. or  she is kneeling in a small room at the edge of the mesa, polished black bone of earth, cherished piki stone, moving back and forth this act of love, grinding the corn until it is dark, brushing the white cornmeal into one basket, the blue into another, thinking already of the daughters she will bear glowing in the sun.  or she is standing at the bog inside a mountain meadow, hands raised up to tie back her hair with a thin red rag; seeds loosen and cling to her shoes, her stockings, her long skirt, her skin. she fearlessly walks through gold fiddleneck, small mountain lupines, clouds of white popcorn flowers fallen upward out of the ground to cover the hillside like snow. or a woman gathers loop after loop of heavy rope to guide the head of the horse she straddles and sometimes she is the mare and the soft sandstone and the hot rocks rolling in acorn soup, trying to heal the gash spread across her path where the crescent moon has sliced the earth. ocean to mountain to mesa, the bundle she carries is a sacred memory, a rainbow that arches from one side of the sky to the other.  or a woman is closing a steamer trunk, has to sit on it hard to get the latch through and the leather buckled; seagulls dive outside the wall of the ship, she hears their demands, maybe one has come inside to brush her cheek with its pointed wing or maybe just another tear warmed by cooling blood.  how she aches in the cold, she is so thin; and when she pulls the blanket around her and lies down on the floor, she is no more than a pile of old rags, a few sticks of firewood, a broken broom. steady against the roll of the sea she is patient as the rocks that wait for the ship along a northern corridor, angry as the storms midway across the atlantic that shake their fists at those who must leave home, and as deeply hidden as the icebergs that threaten to disembowl. she has already seen the world dissolve; now she feels the breaking of one last thread to ancestral land, feels the very break of it.

 two guitars were left in a room all alone they sat on different corners of the parlor in this solitude they started talking to each other my strings are tight and full of tears the man who plays me has no heart i have seen it leave out of his mouth i have seen it melt out of his eyes it dives into the pores of the earth when they squeeze me tight i bring down the angels who live off the chorus the trios singing loosen organs with melodious screwdrivers sentiment comes off the hinges because a song is a mountain put into words and landscape is the feeling that enters something so big in the harmony we are always in danger of blowing up with passion the other guitar: in 1944 new york when the trio los panchos started with mexican &amp; puerto rican birds i am the one that one of them held tight    like a woman their throats gardenia gardens an airport for dreams i've been in theaters and cabarets i played in an apartment on 102nd street after a baptism pregnant with women the men flirted and were offered chicken soup echoes came out of hallways as if from caves someone is opening the door now the two guitars hushed and there was a resonance in the air like what is left by the last chord of a bolero.

 with favoring winds, o'er sunlit seas, we sailed for the hesperides, the land where golden apples grow; but that, ah! that was long ago.  how far, since then, the ocean streams have swept us from that land of dreams, that land of fiction and of truth, the lost atlantis of our youth!  whither, ah, whither? are not these the tempest-haunted orcades, where sea-gulls scream, and breakers roar, and wreck and sea-weed line the shore?  ultima thule! utmost isle! here in thy harbors for a while we lower our sails; a while we rest from the unending, endless quest.

 we have all seen them circling pastures, have looked up from the mouth of a barn, a pine clearing, the fences of our own backyards, and have stood amazed by the one slow wing beat, the endless dihedral drift. but i had never seen so many so close, hundreds, every limb of the dead oak feathered black,  and i cut the engine, let the river grab the jon boat and pull it toward the tree. the black leaves shined, the pink fruit blossomed red, ugly as a human heart. then, as i passed under their dream, i saw for the first time its soft countenance, the raw fleshy jowls wrinkled and generous, like the faces of the very old who have grown to empathize with everything.  and i drifted away from them, slow, on the pull of the river, reluctant, looking back at their roost, calling them what i'd never called them, what they are, those dwarfed transfiguring angels, who flock to the side of the poisoned fox, the mud turtle crushed on the shoulder of the road, who pray over the leaf-graves of the anonymous lost, with mercy enough to consume us all and give us wings.

 drunk on the umbrian hills at dusk and drunk on one pink cloud that stood beside the moon, drunk on the moon, a marble smile, and drunk, two young americans, on one another, far from home and wanting this forever— who needed god? we had our bodies, bread, and glasses of a raw, green, local wine, and watched our godless perfect darkness breed enormous softly burning ancient stars. who needed god? and why do i ask now? because i’m older and i think god stirs in details that keep bringing back that time, details that are just as vivid now— our bodies, bread, a sharp umbrian wine.

 for john fogleman  there are some things we just don’t talk about— not even in the morning, when we’re waking, when your calloused fingers tentatively walk the slope of my waist: how love’s a rust-worn boat, abandoned at the dock—and who could doubt waves lick their teeth, eyeing its hull? we’re taking our wreckage as a promise, so we don’t talk. we wet the tired oars, tide drawing us out.  we understand there’s nothing to be said. both of us know the dangers of this sea, warned by the tide-worn driftwood of our pasts—. but we’ve already strayed from the harbor. we thread a slow wake though the water—then silently, we start to row, and will for as long as this lasts.

 everything is half here, like the marble head of the roman emperor and the lean torso of his favorite. the way the funnel cloud which doesn't seem to touch ground does— flips a few cars, a semi— we learn to walk miles above our bodies. the pig farms dissolve, then the small hills. as in dreams fraught with irrevocable gestures, the ruined set seems larger, a charred palace the gaze tunnels through and through. how well we remember the stage— the actors gliding about like petite sails, the balustrade cooling our palms. not wings or singing, but a darkness fast as blood. it ended at our fingertips: the fence gave way to the forest. the world began.

 for francis and barbara 1 among the high-branching, leafless boughs above the roof-peaks of the town, snowflakes unnumberably come down.  i watched out of the attic window the laced sway of family trees, intricate genealogies  whose strict, reserved gentility, trembling, impossible to bow, received the appalling fall of snow.  all during sunday afternoon, not storming, but befittingly, out of a still, grey, devout sky,  the snowflakes fell, until all shapes went under, and thickening, drunken lines cobwebbed the sleep of solemn pines.  up in the attic, among many things inherited and out of style, i cried, then fell asleep awhile,  waking at night now, as the snow- flakes from darkness to darkness go past yellow lights in the street below.   2 i cried because life is hopeless and beautiful. and like a child i cried myself to sleep high in the head of the house, feeling the hull beneath me pitch and roll among the steep mountains and valleys of the many years that brought me to tears.  down in the cellar, furnace and washing machine, pump, fuse-box, water heater, work their hearts out at my life, which narrowly runs between them and this cemetery of spare parts for discontinued men, whose hats and canes are my rich remains.  and women, their portraits and wedding gowns stacked in the corners, brooding in wooden trunks; and children’s rattles, books about lions and clowns; and headless, hanging dresses swayed like drunks whenever a living footstep shakes the floor; i mention no more;  but what i thought today, that made me cry, is this, that we live in two kinds of thing: the powerful trees, thrusting into the sky their black patience, are one, and that branching relation teaches how we endure and grow; the other is the snow,  falling in a white chaos from the sky, as many as the sands of all the seas, as all the men who died or who will die, as stars in heaven, as leaves of all the trees; as abraham was promised of his seed; generations bleed,  till i, high in the tower of my time among familiar ruins, began to cry for accident, sickness, justice, war and crime, because all died, because i had to die. the snow fell, the trees stood, the promise kept, and a child i slept.

 walking past the open window, she is surprised by the song of the white-throated sparrow and stops to listen. she has been thinking of the dead ones she loves--her father who lived over a century, and her oldest son, suddenly gone at forty-seven--and she can't help thinking she has called them back, that they are calling her in the voices of these birds passing through ohio on their spring migration. . . because, after years of summers in upstate new york, the white-throat has become something like the family bird. her father used to stop whatever he was doing and point out its clear, whistling song. she hears it again: "poor sam peabody peabody peabody." she tries not to think, "poor andy," but she has already thought it, and now she is weeping. but then she hears another, so clear, it's as if the bird were in the room with her, or in her head, telling her that everything will be all right. she cannot see them from her second-story window-- they are hidden in the new leaves of the old maple, or behind the white blossoms of the dogwood-- but she stands and listens, knowing they will stay for only a few days before moving on.

 it will be windy for a while until it isn’t. the waves will shoal. a red-legged cormorant will trace her double along glassy water, forgetting they are hungry. the sea will play this motif over and over, but there will be no preparing for it otherwise. water will quiver in driftwood. sound preceding absence, a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes disappearing into surf. and when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. light rain will fall and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. bow: a knot of two loops, two loose ends, our bodies on either side of this shore where we will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. horseshoe crabs whose blue blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and sea. it will never be enough, the bull kelp like a whip coiling in tender hands, hands who know to take or be taken, but take nothing with them: i will marry you. i will marry you. so we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing.

for we  are overtaken. now no cry, no sword can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge, slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved and changed ... “there’s  nothing like this in the world,” you say, knowing i cannot touch your hand and look too, into that godless cleft of sky where nothing turns but dead sands flashing.  “—and never to quite understand!” no, in all the argosy of your bright hair i dreamed nothing so flagless as this piracy.  but now draw in your head, alone and too tall here. your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam; your breath sealed by the ghosts i do not know: draw in your head and sleep the long way home.   vi   where icy and bright dungeons lift of swimmers their lost morning eyes, and ocean rivers, churning, shift green borders under stranger skies,  steadily as a shell secretes its beating leagues of monotone, or as many waters trough the sun’s red kelson past the cape’s wet stone;  o rivers mingling toward the sky and harbor of the phoenix’ breast— my eyes pressed black against the prow, —thy derelict and blinded guest  waiting, afire, what name, unspoke, i cannot claim: let thy waves rear more savage than the death of kings, some splintered garland for the seer.  beyond siroccos harvesting the solstice thunders, crept away, like a cliff swinging or a sail flung into april’s inmost day—  creation’s blithe and petalled word to the lounged goddess when she rose conceding dialogue with eyes that smile unsearchable repose—  still fervid covenant, belle isle, —unfolded floating dais before which rainbows twine continual hair— belle isle, white echo of the oar!  the imaged word, it is, that holds hushed willows anchored in its glow. it is the unbetrayable reply whose accent no farewell can know.

 long ago we quit lifting our heels like the others—horse, dog, and tiger— though we thrill to their speed as they flee. even the mouse bearing the great weight of a nugget of dog food is enviably graceful. there is little spring to our walk, we are so burdened with responsibility, all of the disciplinary actions that have fallen to us, the punishments, the killings, and all with our feet bound stiff in the skins of the conquered. but sometimes, in the early hours, we can feel what it must have been like to be one of them, up on our toes, stealing past doors where others are sleeping, and suddenly able to see in the dark.

 wash of cold river in a glacial land, ionian water, chill, snow-ribbed sand, drift of rare flowers, clear, with delicate shell- like leaf enclosing frozen lily-leaf, camellia texture, colder than a rose;  wind-flower that keeps the breath of the north-wind— these and none other;  intimate thoughts and kind reach out to share the treasure of my mind, intimate hands and dear drawn garden-ward and sea-ward all the sheer rapture that i would take to mould a clear and frigid statue;  rare, of pure texture, beautiful space and line, marble to grace your inaccessible shrine.  
NEW POEM
 a man with binoculars fixed a shape in the field and we stopped and saw  the albino buck browsing in the oats—white dash on a page of green,  flick of a blade cutting paint to canvas. it dipped its head  and green effaced the white, bled onto the absence that the buck was—animal erasure.  head up again, its sugar legs pricked the turf, pink antler prongs brushed at flies.  here in a field was the imagined world made visible—a mythical beast filling its rumen with clover  until all at once it startled, flagged its bright tail— auf wiedersehen, surrender—  and leapt away— a white tooth in the closing mouth of the woods.

 now that the theoretical physicist slash cosmologist has explained to me, has laid out in clean even rows of logic  how every atom in my body arrived from a star, a star that blasted apart, and the atoms of my left hand   originated from a different sun than my right,  i can shine. i can go dark  recalling how my grandfather made the vertical blinds rattle when he shoved my grandmother into them.   startled in the yard, i turned to that sound, from the flower bed my eyes were held by  the swaying blinds. it took a while for each to line up perfectly straight again, to tell myself  she slipped. only then could i  return to stalking the butterflies. my right hand was quick: reach and pinch. i had so many soft wings that summer  between my thumb and index, so many of them skewered on cactus needles.  i was a kid. i was cruel slash gentle. he was cruel slash gentle. he had witnessed my destroying and i saw  across his creased face empathy for them.  after his scolding i placed one dead one inside the white envelope of a flower.  under the sun it glowed. under the moon, more glowing.

 i want a red dress. i want it flimsy and cheap, i want it too tight, i want to wear it until someone tears it off me. i want it sleeveless and backless, this dress, so no one has to guess what’s underneath. i want to walk down the street past thrifty’s and the hardware store with all those keys glittering in the window, past mr. and mrs. wong selling day-old donuts in their café, past the guerra brothers slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly, hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders. i want to walk like i’m the only woman on earth and i can have my pick. i want that red dress bad. i want it to confirm your worst fears about me, to show you how little i care about you or anything except what i want. when i find it, i’ll pull that garment from its hanger like i’m choosing a body to carry me into this world, through the birth-cries and the love-cries too, and i’ll wear it like bones, like skin, it’ll be the goddamned dress they bury me in.

 after three weeks of hot weather and drought, we've had a week of cold and rain, just the way it ought to be here in the north, in june, a fire going in the woodstove all day long, so you can go outside in the cold and rain anytime and smell the wood smoke in the air.  this is the way i love it. this is why i came here almost fifty years ago. what is june anyway without cold and rain and a fire going in the stove all day?

 as grains sort inside a schist  an ancient woodland indicator called dark dog’s mercury  river like liquid shale  and white-tipped black lizard-turds on the blue wall  for a loss that every other loss fits inside  picking a mole until it bleeds  as the day heaves forward on faked determinations  if it’s not all juxtaposition, she asked, what is the binding agent?  creepy always to want to pin words on “the emotional experience”  azure hoplia cockchafer, the caddisworm, the bee-louse, blister beetle, assassin bug  the recriminations swarm around sunset  when it was otherwise quiet all the way around  you who were given a life, what did you make of it?

 what land have you cast from the blotted-out region of your face?  what nation stung by watermarks was filmed out of extinction and brought forth resembling frost?  what offspring must jump through the eye of birth to be winked at when covered with brick sweat?  what ache piled its planks on the corner pier, now crumbles onto motionless water, sniffed at by forest smoke?  what makes this song a string of beads seized by cement cracks when the camera climbs through the basement window—winter clouds coiling through its speckled lens?  what season cannot locate an eye in the dark of the sound of the sun gyrating into red ocher after i thought you noticed my language was half wren, half pigeon and, together, we spoke a wing pattern on the wall that was raised to keep “us” out, there where “calling” became “culling,” “distance” distanced, in a mere scrape of enamel on yellow teeth?  what father woke, turned over his wife, she didn’t want to, but he pushed until the baby leapt through, now, now, now, strummed into a chorus of burn marks on ceilings where police sirens fruit magpie skulls on trees of monsoon lightning?  what, what, what—is how that song chimed in wilderness.

 you were a girl of satin and gauze now you are my mountain and waterfall companion. long ago i read those lines of po chu i written in his middle age. young as i was they touched me. i never thought in my own middle age i would have a beautiful young dancer to wander with me by falling crystal waters, among mountains of snow and granite, least of all that unlike po’s girl she would be my very daughter.  the earth turns towards the sun. summer comes to the mountains. blue grouse drum in the red fir woods all the bright long days. you put blue jay and flicker feathers in your hair. two and two violet green swallows play over the lake. the blue birds have come back to nest on the little island. the swallows sip water on the wing and play at love and dodge and swoop just like the swallows that swirl under and over the ponte vecchio. light rain crosses the lake hissing faintly. after the rain there are giant puffballs with tortoise shell backs at the edge of the meadow. snows of a thousand winters melt in the sun of one summer. wild cyclamen bloom by the stream. trout veer in the transparent current. in the evening marmots bark in the rocks. the scorpion curls over the glimmering ice field. a white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets. thunder growls far off. our campfire is a single light amongst a hundred peaks and waterfalls. the manifold voices of falling water talk all night. wrapped in your down bag starlight on your cheeks and eyelids your breath comes and goes in a tiny cloud in the frosty night. ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise. ten thousand years revolve without change. all this will never be again.  
NEW POEM
 when i am asked how i began writing poems, i talk about the indifference of nature.  it was soon after my mother died, a brilliant june day, everything blooming.  i sat on a gray stone bench in a lovingly planted garden, but the day lilies were as deaf as the ears of drunken sleepers and the roses curved inward. nothing was black or broken and not a leaf fell and the sun blared endless commercials for summer holidays.  i sat on a gray stone bench ringed with the ingenue faces of pink and white impatiens and placed my grief in the mouth of language, the only thing that would grieve with me.

NEW POEM
 this was a true happening but (as you will see shortly) not such as would ready me for future ones. what has brisk disaster to do with a leisurely ordeal? neither event, as you will notice also, has made me an understanding man. it was my watch one night, away then on the sea, when leaning on a couple of crates of something i dreamed of nothing special into the dark, and whispered the smoke of a sugared native product into the dark. then from behind a quick rush burst not six feet over me with a sawing and then a cracking sound, and the other watch pointed up where a black squall ran port-side into the distance and a six by six crate lid veered and disappeared like a gull. but the other time we were idle ashore for days somewhere there are sandy foothills and small plains with weeds that stand like birds, and there was a steady blow on land that left off out at sea, leaving us all peculiar if i remember. the wind rasped the dense whorls of sharp leaves low on the ground and shrilled through the heads on the tall seed-stalks, and all those days the sound rose until we, without hope, without breath bore the conviction that our sojourn had not begun and had no end, like a period of dissipation.  in certain spanish havens the beggars come to you saying “give me an amount. god will make it good.” had they been wise those ladies would have said something of that kind and proffered a gratifying smile to their junior treasurer the other tuesday and maybe been spared a peculiar fall. for forgetting their cards or missing dues or due to rancor from a month of planning they were turned away from the luncheon which might have saved them through its regular plaudits and calls to order. instead they turned immediately back after some while waiting with other members in vying groups where the sound rose and narrowed, and from the dim hushed hall those five ladies, my individual patrons, came across the park together, under a hefty sun, under slight muffling rain, to my teashop. i worked on a cruising vessel one season and saw a woman being led below about a minute after she had vaulted the rail, and now her face cluttered with casts of hair returned to me, and a suggestion of the odor of moist wool. then, after ordering, over the tinkle of service, the ladies called me and began the question of a particular person none had touched, wondering by turns in words like these:  “maybe when he was a child he went alone one night along the lakeside or followed streams in the dark and mating mayflies swarmed him or he was caught by a swirl of slippery animals risen from rotted cresses. it could be too a bird’s egg fell on him, that red and yellow spattering his coat showed him the partial form of brain and bill and wings like candy arms.” a second lady established the problem but in studious and in idle terms: “he must have tried becoming a sphere once when something hurt and must have failed. he is a cylinder and lacking the perfected self-containment of the sphere he nonetheless has beauty and though incomplete is unassailable.” the third advanced the first with this addition: “maybe when he was a child and a good half he planted a happy garden for himself and tried to bring a boyish girl inside to share his secrets he could not bestow.” the fourth supposed some more years and less hope and figured on effects of disaffection: “perhaps it was a time sprouting potatoes came creeping like things of the undersea surrounding him that gave him the first fevered turn toward what we now call his fine beauty.” the last lady came near to reconciling them: “some awareness certainly shook him unawares once and he flinched and flinching has made him beautiful to all of us who admire huge eyed skittishness, the fawn standing some steps off always awkward and desired.”  odd gulls often join before a gale to bank and shrill in company, then at the heavy time of it they hush and float broadcast. those ladies did the same the other tuesday. hopeless and breathless, both i and they rode like sitting birds into a last lull, and i was not (as you have seen) prepared by quick calamities of ocean labor for land bound suffering at ease. understanding or unconcern could serve but pain and malice won, and who may be forgiven even his shapeless victories? “the boy is never by himself,” i said, “but by him stands an unseen friend whose face came in the petal fall under a secret tree, who meets his vague eyes with beaming gaps and his remote grin with a long lipless smile.”  
NEW POEM
 coleridge carefully wrote down a whole page of them, all beginning with the letter b. guidebooks preserve our knowledge of their hues and shapes, their breeding. many poems have made delicate word-chimes— like wind-chimes not for wind but for the breath of man— out of their lovely names. at the edge of the prairie in a cabin when thunder comes closer to thump the roof hard a few of them—in a corner, brittle in a dry jar where a woman’s thoughtful hand left them to fade— seem to blow with the announcing winds outside as the rain begins to fall on all their supple kin of all colors, under a sky of one color, or none.  
NEW POEM
 at dawn wind out of the north, hailflecks, pebbly skates against windows. i lie thinking the drainspout’s drip comes again in the basement faucet where i am crying, a child betrayed by death’s new cardinal and the cat yawning on the porch where my grandmother found me.  risen now, i see the river full-bodied, its white wind-knotted hair swirling like hers. the polar hickory is naked as a saber recalled by a girl long gone in the gold sauce of apples. two leaves that might be cardinals returned tumble in the hard light at the brick fence. nothing moves in boxwood where gray soldiers lie.  among the last of them she walked, cupping apples, staining her white frock, who took a boy far back into the haze the shenandoah hills held where family stallions might walk aimless ground littered with purpling flesh beyond the cull of seasons. through a gate nailed with leather belts in my mind, i pass and enter the arthritic orchard tended by widows. what i gather wakes me to think  how bright on the tongue was the taste kept concealed, sustained, of flesh abiding, months beneath the wintering house floors. to reach this i must go down storm-worn stones and pick my steps past the sealed boxes of family debris, nightgowns, flannels, ribbons, birthspoons, a pair of dulled skates, flowers pressed in a moldy bible.  why is it we keep what we cannot bear to use, and can’t escape, shoving ourselves into shrunken rooms edged with old foolishness unforgiven and unforgotten? i fumble to the center and pull a yellow light down the ancient string still dependably there and stand, in my head, as she did, playfully asking where they went. i know, i know, i say back there in the dust where i’ve come again to look through tiny windows into skirts of boxwood, a morning  that sends me alive among gray soldiers at the house roots. i see also blue preserving jars full of slick pulpy flesh she has put up in a juice thick as blood. behind it all in dark eaves, baskets of apples, split pine boxes like generations steeping, undisturbed by the tick and groan of housepipes veining the overhead i leave. oh let me see her light bring back those stallion-feeders, little red handfuls of joy! look  how long i’ve slept, learning to walk straight into a dawn-silvered web where secret spiders spin ceaseless as the seasons. above me ice takes each room, i can hear feet pacing fretful halls, yet here i lift my face and puff back all the silk in the world. i hold every core peeled on this slab. my fingers claw the meat of family stillness, parting all the way to seeds.  oh widows of the air, fill me with your cidery, useless lying, those bladed hours you fed me the dark rotting dreams of your love.  
NEW POEM
 the wintry west extends his blast, and hail and rain does blaw; or, the stormy north sends driving forth the blinding sleet and snaw: while tumbling brown, the burn comes down, and roars frae bank to brae; and bird and beast in covert rest, and pass the heartless day.  the sweeping blast, the sky o’ercast, the joyless winter-day, let others fear, to me more dear than all the pride of may: the tempest’s howl, it soothes my soul, my griefs it seems to join; the leafless trees my fancy please, their fate resembles mine!  thou pow’r supreme, whose mighty scheme these woes of mine fulfil, here, firm, i rest, they must be best, because they are thy will! then all i want (o, do thou grant this one request of mine!) since to enjoy thou dost deny, assist me to resign.  
NEW POEM
 dark frost was in the air without, the dusk was still with cold and gloom, when less than even a shadow came and stood within the room.  but of the three around the fire, none turned a questioning head to look, still read a clear voice, on and on, still stooped they o’er their book.  the children watched their mother’s eyes moving on softly line to line; it seemed to listen too—that shade, yet made no outward sign.  the fire-flames crooned a tiny song, no cold wind stirred the wintry tree; the children both in faërie dreamed beside their mother’s knee.  and nearer yet that spirit drew above that heedless one, intent only on what the simple words of her small story meant.  no voiceless sorrow grieved her mind, no memory her bosom stirred, nor dreamed she, as she read to two, ’twas surely three who heard.  yet when, the story done, she smiled from face to face, serene and clear, a love, half dread, sprang up, as she leaned close and drew them near.

 a yellow leaf in the branches of a shamel ash in the front yard; i see it, a yellow leaf among so many. nothing distinguishes it, nothing striking, striped, stripped, strident, nothing more than its yellow on this day, which is enough, which makes me think of it later in the day, remember it in conversation with a friend, though i do not mention it— a yellow leaf on a shamel ash on a clear day in an arizona winter, a january like so many.  
NEW POEM
 from sonnets, second series   xxx  yet, even ‘mid merry boyhood’s tricks and scapes, early my heart a deeper lesson learnt; wandering alone by many a mile burnt black woodside, that but the snow-flake decks and drapes. and i have stood beneath canadian sky, in utter solitudes, where the cricket’s cry appals the heart, and fear takes visible shapes; and on long island’s void and isolate capes heard the sea break like iron bars: and still, in all, i seemed to hear the same deep dirge; borne in the wind, the insect’s tiny trill, and crash and jangle of the shaking surge; and knew not what they meant,—prophetic woe? dim bodings, wherefore? now, indeed, i know!  
NEW POEM
 the sky has been dark for many years. my skin has become as damp and pale as rice paper and feels the way mother’s used to before the drying sun parched it out there in the fields.  lately, when i touch my eyelids, my hands react as if i had just touched something hot enough to burn. my skin, aspirin colored, tingles with migraine. mother has been massaging the left side of my face especially in the evenings when the pain flares up.  this morning her breathing was graveled, her voice gruff with affection when i wheeled her into the bath. she was in a good humor, making jokes about her great breasts, floating in the milky water like two walruses, flaccid and whiskered around the nipples. i scrubbed them with a sour taste in my mouth, thinking: six children and an old man have sucked from these brown nipples.  i was almost tender when i came to the blue bruises that freckle her body, places where she has been injecting insulin for thirty years. i soaped her slowly, she sighed deeply, her eyes closed. it seems it has always been like this: the two of us in this sunless room, the splashing of the bathwater.  in the afternoons when she has rested, she prepares our ritual of tea and rice, garnished with a shred of gingered fish, a slice of pickled turnip, a token for my white body. we eat in the familiar silence. she knows i am not to be trusted, even now planning my escape. as i toast to her health with the tea she has poured, a thousand cranes curtain the window, fly up in a sudden breeze.
