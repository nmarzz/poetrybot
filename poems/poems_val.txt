 what makes us so mean we are meaner than gorillas the ones we like to blame our genetic aggression on it is in our nature to hide behind what darwin said about survival as if survival were the most important thing on earth it isnt you knowsurely it has occurred to you that there is no way that humankind will survive another million years well be lucky to be around another five hundred why because we are so mean that we would rather kill everyone and everything on earth than let anybody get the better of us give me liberty or give me death why didnt he just say grrr lets kill each other  a nosegay of pansies leans toward us in a glass of water on a white tablecloth bright in the sunlight at the ocean where children are frolicking then looking around and wondering about what we cannot say for we are imagining how we would kill the disgusting man and woman at the next table tonight we could throw an electrical storm into their bed no more would they spit on the veranda actually they arent that bad its just that i am talking mean in order to be more like my fellow humansits lonely feeling like a saint which i do one second every five weeks but that one second is so intense i cant stand up and then i figure out that its ersatz i cant be a saint i am not even a religious person i am hardly a person at all except when i look at you and think that this life with you must go on forever because it is so perfect with all its imperfections like your waistline that exists a little too much like my hairline that doesnt exist at all which means that my bald head feels good on your soft round belly that feels good too if only everyone were us  but sometimes we are everyone we get mad at the world and mean as all getout which means we want to tell the world to get out of this our world who are all these awful people why its your own grandma who was so nice to you you mistook her for someone else she actually was someone else but you had no way of knowing that just as you had no way of knowing that the taxi driver saves his pennies all year to go to paris for racine at the comédie francaise now he is reciting a long speech in french from andromache and you arrive at the corner of this and that and though andromaches noble husband hector has been killed and his corpse has been dragged around the walls of troy by an unusually mean achilles although she is forced into slavery and a marriage to save the life of her son and then people around her get killed commit suicide and go crazy the driver is in paradise he has taken you back to his very mean teacher in the unhappy school in portauprince and then to paris and back to the french language of the seventeenth century and then to ancient greece and then to the corner of this and that only a mean world would have this man driving around in a city where for no reason someone is going to fire a bullet into the back of his head  it was an act of kindness on the part of the person who placed both numbers and letters on the dial of the phone so we could call waverly atwater canareggio blenheim and madison dunbar and ocean little worlds in themselves we drift into as we dial and an act of cruelty to change everything into numbers only not just phone numbers that get longer and longer but statistical analysis cost averaging collateral damage death by peanut inflation rates personal identification numbers access codes and the whole raving raft of the medusa that drives out any thought of pleasantness until you dial i8oomattres and in no time get a mattress that is complete and comfy and almost under you even though you didnt need one the men come in and say heres the mattress wheres the bedroom and the bedroom realizes it cant run away you cant say that the people who invented the bedroom were mean only a bedroom could say that if it could say anything its a good thing that bedrooms cant talk they might keep you up all night telling you things you dont want to know many years ago in this very room    eeek shut up i mean please dont tell me anything im sorry i shouted at you and the walls subside into their somewhat foreverness the wrecking ball will mash its grimace into the plaster and oof down they will come lathe and layers of personal history but the ball is not mean nor is the man who pulls the handle that directs the ball on its pendulous course but another man and now a woman strides into his office and slaps his face hard the man whose bottom line is changing its color wants to change it back so goodbye building where we made love laughed wept ate and watched tv all at the same time where our dog waited by the door eyes fixed on the knob where a runaway stream came whooshing down the hallway where i once expanded to fill the whole room and then deflated just to see what it would feel like where on saturday mornings my infant son stood by the bedside and sang quietly waaake up to his snoozing parents  i can never leave all the kindness i have felt in this apartment but if a big black iron wrecking ball comes flying toward me zoop out i go for there must be kindness somewhere else in the world maybe even out of it though im not crazy about the emptiness of outer space i have to live here with finite life and inner space and with the horrible desire to love everything and be disappointed the way my mother was until that moment when she rolled her eyes toward me as best she could and squeezed my hand when i asked do you know who i am then let go of life  the other question was did i know who i was  it is hard not to be appalled by existence the pointlessness of matter turns us into cornered animals that otherwise are placid or indifferent we hiss and bare our fangs and attack but how many people have felt the terror of existence was genghis khan horrified that he and everything else existed was hitler or pol pot or any of the other charming figures of history je men doute it was something else made them mean something else made napoleon think it glorious to cover the frozen earth with a hundred thousand bloody corpses something else made    oh name your monster and his penchant for destruction name your own period in history when a darkness swept over us and made not existing seem like the better choice as if the solution to hunger were to hurl oneself into a vat of boiling radioactive carrots  life is so awful i hope that lion tears me to pieces  it is good that those men wearing black hoods are going to strip off my skin and force me to gape at my own intestines spilling down onto the floor please drive spikes through not only my hands and feet but through my eyes as well for this world is to be fled as soon as possible via the purification of martyrdom this from the god of christian love cupid hovers overhead perplexed long ago zeus said he was tired and went to bed if youre not going to exist its best to be asleep the christian god is like a cranky twothousandyearold baby whose fatigue delivers him into an endless tantrum he will never grow up because you cant grow up unless people listen to you and they cant listen because they are too busy being mean or fearing the meanness of others how can i blame them i too am afraid i can be jolted by an extremely violent movie but what is really scary is that someone wanted to make the film he is only a step away from the father who took his eightyearold daughter and her friend to the park and beat and stabbed them to death uhoh he seemed like a normal guy said his neighbor thelma who refused to divulge her last name to reporters she seemed like a normal gal just as the reporters seemed like normal vampires in some cultures it is normal to eat bugs or people or to smear placenta on your face at night to buy a car whose price would feed a village for thirty years to waste your life and while youre at it waste everyone elses too hello america it is dawn wake up and smell yourselves you smell normal my father was not normal he was a criminal a scuffler a tough guy and though he did bad things he was never mean he didnt like mean people either sometimes he would beat them up or chop up their shoes i have never beaten anyone up but it might be fun to chop up some shoes would you please hand me that cleaver thelma  but thelma is insulted by my request even though i said please because she has the face of a cleaver that flies through the air toward me and lodges in my forehead get it yourself lughead she spits then twenty years later she changes lughead to fuckhead i change my name to jughead and go into the poetry protection program so my poems can go out and live under assumed names in utah and muskogee  anna chukhno looks up and sees me through her violet ukrainian eyes and says good morning most pleasantly inflected oh to ride in a horsedrawn carriage with her at midnight down the wide avenues of kiev and erase the ditch at babi yar from human history she looks up and asks how would you like that i say in twenties and she counts them out as if the air around her were not shattered by her beauty and my body thus divided into zones hands the place of metaphysics shins the area of moo bones the cost of living and so on is it cruel that i cannot cover her with kisses no it is beautiful that i cannot cover her with kisses it is better that i walk out into the sunlight with the blessing of having spoken with an actual goddess who gave me four hundred dollars and i am reassembled as my car goes forward into the oncoming rays of aggression that bounce off my glasses and then start penetrating and soon my eyes turn into abandoned coal mines whose canaries explode into an evil song that echoes exactly nowhere  at least i am not in rwanda in 1994 or the sudan in 05 or guantanamo or rikers or in a ditch outside rio clubbed to death and mutilated no cossack bears down on me with sword raised and gleaming at my jewish neck and no time for me to cry out it is only my neck that is jewish the rest is russian orthodox no smiling man tips back his hat and says to his buddies lets teach this nigguh a lesson i dont need a lesson sir i am ethiopian this is my first time in your country but you gentlemen are joking     prepare my cave and then kindly forget where it was a crust of bread will suffice and a stream nearby the chill of evening filtering in with the blind god who is the chill of evening and who touches us though we cant raise our hands to stroke his misty beard in which two hundred million stars have wink and glimmer needles  i had better go back to the bank we have only three hundred and eightyfive dollars left those fifteen units of beauty went fast as does everything but meanness comes back right away while kindness takes its own sweet time and compassion is busy shimmering always a little above us and behind swooping down and transfusing us only when we dont expect it and then only for a moment how can i trap it allow it in and then turn my body into steel no the exit holes will still be there and besides compassion doesnt need an exit it is an exit from the prison that each moment is and just as each moment replaces the one before it each jolt of meanness replaces the one before it and pretty soon you get to like those jolts you and millions of other dolts who like to be electrocuted by their own feelings the hippopotamus sits on you with no sense of pleasure he doesnt even know you are there any more than he takes notice of the little white bird atop his head and when he sees you flattened against the ground he doesnt even think uhoh he just trots away with the bird still up there looking around saint augustine stole the pears from his neighbors tree and didnt apologize for thirty years by which time his neighbor was probably dead and in no mood for apologies augustines mother became a saint and then a city in californiasanta monica where everything exists so it can be driven past except the hippopotamus that stands on the freeway in the early dawn and yawns into your high beams hello he seems to grunt i cant be your friend and i cant be your enemy i am like compassion i go on just beyond you no matter how many times you crash into me and die because you never learned to crash and live then he ambles away could saint augustine have put on that much weight i thought compassion makes you light or at least have light the way it has light around it in paintings like the one of the screwdriver that appeared just when the screw was coming loose from the wing of the airplane in which santa monica was riding into heaven smiling as if she had just imagined how to smile the first smile of any saint a promise toward the perfection of everything that is and isnt

 after experience taught me that all the ordinary surroundings of social life are futile and vain  i’m going to show you something very ugly someday it might save your life  seeing that none of the things i feared contain in themselves anything either good or bad  what if you get caught without a knife nothingeven a loop of piano wire  excepting only in the effect they had upon my mind i resolved to inquire  take the first two fingers of this hand fork them outkind of a “v for victory”  whether there might be something whose discovery would grant me supreme unending happiness  and jam them into the eyes of your enemy you have to do this hard very hard then press  no virtue can be thought to have priority over this endeavor to preserve one’s being  both fingers down around the cheekbone and setting your foot high into the chest  no man can desire to act rightly to be blessed to live rightly without simultaneously  you must call up every strength you own and you can rip off the whole facial mask  wishing to be to act to live he must ask first in other words to actually exist   and you whiner who wastes your time dawdling over the remorseless earth what evil what unspeakable crime have you made your life worth

 when one thing is becoming another when writing is morphing when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing typewriters even a nib and ink well and considering all the ways of stretching a space digital or hard copy hard copy an ugly expression for printed matter and for that matter printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty page a soft and elongated word page an extension at the end of my fingers page a screen that holds dreams and desires the page of legal document that bind the page is a promise i read all sides turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what i may have missed desire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid the pen is a body an anatomy not an earthworm with indecipherable ends the pen has a head and tail and inky guts and the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks later hoursanother hourlate hoursearly hourshappy hourvisiting hours  all the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses but i know the nest is early paper the raw ingredients and pulp i know the world is a page turner a paper globe and i know that the birds are the great writers of the sky

 as the dead prey upon us they are the dead in ourselves awake my sleeping ones i cry out to you disentangle the nets of being  i pushed my car it had been sitting so long unused i thought the tires looked as though they only needed air but suddenly the huge underbody was above me and the rear tires were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together  as were the dead souls in the living room gathered about my mother some of them taking care to pass beneath the beam of the movie projector some record playing on the victrola and all of them desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell  i turned to the young man on my right and asked “how is it there” and he begged me protestingly don’t ask we are poor poor and the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations of brake linings and other automotive accessories cardboard displays the dead roaming from one to another as bored back in life as they are in hell poor and doomed to mere equipments  my mother as alive as ever she was asleep when i entered the house as i often found her in a rocker under the lamp and awaking as i came up to her as she ever had  i found out she returns to the house once a week and with her the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death as other like suited and dressed people did in life  o the dead  and the indian woman and i enabled the blue deer to walk  and the blue deer talked in the next room a negro talk  it was like walking a jackass and its talk was the pressing gabber of gammers of old women  and we helped walk it around the room because it was seeking socks or shoes for its hooves now that it was acquiring  human possibilities  in the five hindrances men and angels stay caught in the net in the immense nets which spread out across each plane of being the multiple nets which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels and the demons and men go up and down  walk the jackass hear the victrola let the automobile be tucked into a corner of the white fence when it is a white chair purity  is only an instant of being the trammels  recur  in the five hindrances perfection is hidden i shall get to the place 10 minutes late  it will be 20 minutes of 9 and i don’t know  without the car  how i shall get there  o peace my mother i do not know how differently i could have done what i did or did not do  that you are back each week that you fall asleep with your face to the right  that you are present there when i come in as you were when you were alive  that you are as solid and your flesh is as i knew it that you have the company i am used to your having  but o that you all find it such a cheapness  o peace mother for the mammothness of the comings and goings of the ladders of life  the nets we are entangled in awake my soul let the power into the last wrinkle of  being let none of the threads and rubber of the tires be left upon the earth let even your mother go let there be only paradise  the desperateness is that the instant which is also paradise paradise is happiness dissolves into the next instant and power flows to meet the next occurrence  is it any wonder my mother comes back do not that throng rightly seek the room where they might expect happiness they did not complain of life they obviously wanted the movie each other merely to pass among each other there where the real is even to the display cards to be out of hell  the poverty of hell  o souls in life and in death make even as you sleep even in sleep know what wind even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile lifts it away clears the sodden weights of goods equipment entertainment the foods the indian woman the filthy blue deer the 4 by 3 foot ‘viewbook’ the heaviness of the old house the stuffed inner room lifts the sodden nets  and they disappear as ghosts do as spider webs nothing before the hand of man  the vent you must have the vent or you shall die which means never to die the ghastliness  of going and forever coming back returning to the instants which were not lived  o mother this i could not have done i could not have lived what you didn’t i am myself netted in my own being  i want to die i want to make that instant too perfect  o my soul slip the cog   ii  the death in life death itself is endless eternity is the false cause  the knot is other wise each topological corner presents itself and no sword cuts it each knot is itself its fire  each knot of which the net is made is for the hands to untake the knot’s making and touch alone can turn the knot into its own flame  o mother if you had once touched me  o mother if i had once touched you  the car did not burn its underside was not presented to me a grotesque corpse the old man  merely removed it as i looked up at it and put it in a corner of the picket fence like was it my mother’s white dog  or a child’s chair  the woman playing on the grass with her son the woman next door  was angry with me whatever it was slipped across the playpen or whatever she had out there on the grass  and i was quite flip in reply that anyone who used plastic had to expect things to skid  and break that i couldn’t worry that her son might have been hurt by whatever it was i sent skidding  down on them  it was just then i went into my house and to my utter astonishment found my mother sitting there  as she always had sat as must she always forever sit there her head lolling into sleep awake awake my mother  what wind will lift you too forever from the tawdriness make you rich as all those souls  crave crave crave  to be rich  they are right we must have what we want we cannot afford not to we have only one course  the nets which entangle us are flames  o souls burn alive burn now  that you may forever have peace have  what you crave  o souls go into everything let not one knot pass through your fingers  let not any they tell you you must sleep as the net comes through your authentic hands  what passes is what is what shall be what has been what hell and heaven is is earth to be rent to shoot you through the screen of flame which each knot hides as all knots are a wall ready to be shot open by you  the nets of being are only eternal if you sleep as your hands ought to be busy method method  i too call on you to come to the aid of all men to women most who know most to woman to tell men to awake awake men awake  i ask my mother to sleep i ask her to stay in the chair my chair is in the corner of the fence she sits by the fireplace made of paving stones the blue deer need not trouble either of us  and if she sits in happiness the souls who trouble her and me will also rest the automobile  has been hauled away

 as the team’s headbrass flashed out on the turn the lovers disappeared into the wood i sat among the boughs of the fallen elm that strewed an angle of the fallow and watched the plough narrowing a yellow square of charlock every time the horses turned instead of treading me down the ploughman leaned upon the handles to say or ask a word about the weather next about the war scraping the share he faced towards the wood and screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed once more the blizzard felled the elm whose crest i sat in by a woodpecker’s round hole the ploughman said “when will they take it away” “when the war’s over” so the talk began one minute and an interval of ten a minute more and the same interval “have you been out” “no” “and don’t want to perhaps” “if i could only come back again i should i could spare an arm i shouldn’t want to lose a leg if i should lose my head why so i should want nothing more    have many gone from here” “yes” “many lost” “yes a good few only two teams work on the farm this year one of my mates is dead the second day in france they killed him it was back in march the very night of the blizzard too now if he had stayed here we should have moved the tree” “and i should not have sat here everything would have been different for it would have been another world” “ay and a better though if we could see all all might seem good” then the lovers came out of the wood again the horses started and for the last time i watched the clods crumble and topple over after the ploughshare and the stumbling team

 can these movements which move themselves be the substance of my attraction where does this thin green silk come from that covers my body surely any woman wearing such fabrics would move her body just to feel them touching every part of her  yet most of the women frown or look away or laugh stiffly they are afraid of these materials and these movements in some way the psychologists would say they are afraid of themselves somehow perhaps awakening too much desire that their men could never satisfy so they keep themselves laced and buttoned and made up in hopes that the framework will keep them stiff enough not to feel the whole register in hopes that they will not have to experience that unquenchable desire for rhythm and contact  if a snake glided across this floor most of them would faint or shrink away yet that movement could be their own that smooth movement frightens them awakening ancestors and relatives to the tips of the arms and toes  so my bare feet and my thin green silks my bells and finger cymbals offend themfrighten their oldyoung bodies while the men simper and leer glad for the vicarious experience and exercise they do not realize how i scorn them or how i dance for their frightened unawakened sweet women

said he far o’er the swanroad he fain would seek the noble monarch who needed men the prince’s journey by prudent folk was little blamed though they loved him dear they whetted the hero and hailed good omens and now the bold one from bands of geats comrades chose the keenest of warriors e’er he could find with fourteen men the seawood   he sought and sailor proved led them on to the land’s confines time had now flown   afloat was the ship boat under bluff on board they climbed warriors ready waves were churning sea with sand the sailors bore on the breast of the bark their bright array their mail and weapons the men pushed off on its willing way the wellbraced craft then moved o’er the waters by might of the wind that bark like a bird with breast of foam till in season due on the second day the curved prow such course had run that sailors now could see the land seacliffs shining steep high hills headlands broad their haven was found their journey ended up then quickly the weders’   clansmen climbed ashore anchored their seawood with armor clashing and gear of battle god they thanked for passing in peace o’er the paths of the sea now saw from the cliff a scylding clansman a warden that watched the waterside how they bore o’er the gangway glittering shields wargear in readiness wonder seized him to know what manner of men they were straight to the strand his steed he rode hrothgar’s henchman with hand of might he shook his spear and spake in parley “who are ye then ye armed men mailed folk that yon mighty vessel have urged thus over the ocean ways here o’er the waters a warden i sentinel set o’er the seamarch here lest any foe to the folk of danes with harrying fleet should harm the land no aliens ever at ease thus bore them lindenwielders   yet

broadbosomed ship  then shone the boars over the cheekguard chased with gold keen and gleaming guard it kept o’er the man of war as marched along heroes in haste till the hall they saw broad of gable and bright with gold that was the fairest ‘mid folk of earth of houses ‘neath heaven where hrothgar lived and the gleam of it lightened o’er lands afar the sturdy shieldsman showed that bright burgoftheboldest bade them go straightway thither his steed then turned hardy hero and hailed them thus “tis time that i fare from you father almighty in grace and mercy guard you well safe in your seekings seaward i go ‘gainst hostile warriors hold my watch” stonebright the street   it showed the way to the crowd of clansmen corselets glistened handforged hard on their harness bright the steel ring sang as they strode along in mail of battle and marched to the hall there weary of ocean the wall along they set their bucklers their broad shields down and bowed them to bench the breastplates clanged wargear of men their weapons stacked spears of the seafarers stood together graytipped ash that iron band was worthily weaponed  a warrior proud asked of the heroes their home and kin “whence now bear ye burnished shields harness gray and helmets grim spears in multitude messenger i hrothgar’s herald heroes so many ne’er met i as strangers of mood so strong ‘tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile for highhearted valor hrothgar ye seek” him the sturdyinwar bespake with words proud earl of the weders answer made hardy ‘neath helmet”hygelac’s we fellows at board i am beowulf named i am seeking to say to the son of healfdene this mission of mine to thy masterlord the doughty prince if he deign at all grace that we greet him the good one now” wulfgar spake the wendles’ chieftain whose might of mind to many was known his courage and counsel “the king of danes the scyldings’ friend i fain will tell the breakerofrings as the boon thou askest the famed prince of thy faring hither and swiftly after such answer bring as the doughty monarch may deign to give” hied then in haste to where hrothgar sat whitehaired and old his earls about him till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there of the danish king good courtier he wulfgar spake to his winsome lord “hither have fared to thee farcome men o’er the paths of ocean people of geatland and the stateliest there by his sturdy band is beowulf named this boon they seek that they my master may with thee have speech at will nor spurn their prayer to give them hearing gracious hrothgar in weeds of the warrior worthy they methinks of our liking their leader most surely a hero that hither his henchmen has led” hrothgar answered helmet of scyldings “i knew him of yore in his youthful days his aged father was ecgtheow named to whom at home gave hrethel the geat his only daughter their offspring bold fares hither to seek the steadfast friend and seamen too have said me this  who carried my gifts to the

against horror of grendel i hope to give the good youth gold for his gallant thought be thou in haste and bid them hither clan of kinsmen to come before me and add this word  they are welcome guests to folk of the danes” to the door of the hall wulfgar went and the word declared “to you this message my master sends eastdanes’ king that your kin he knows hardy heroes and hails you all welcome hither o’er waves of the sea ye may wend your way in warattire and under helmets hrothgar greet but let here the battleshields bide your parley and wooden warshafts wait its end” uprose the mighty one ringed with his men brave band of thanes some bode without battlegear guarding as bade the chief then hied that troop where the herald led them under heorot’s roof the hero strode hardy ‘neath helm till the hearth he neared beowulf spake  his breastplate gleamed warnet woven by wit of the smith “thou hrothgar hail hygelac’s i kinsman and follower fame a plenty have i gained in youth these

sturdyspirited sat them down hardyhearted a henchman attended carried the carven cup in hand served the clear mead oft minstrels sang blithe in heorot heroes revelled no dearth of warriors weder and dane unferth spake the son of ecglaf who sat at the feet of the scyldings’ lord unbound the battlerunes    beowulf’s quest sturdy seafarer’s sorely galled him ever he envied that other men should more achieve in middleearth of fame under heaven than he himself  “art thou that beowulf breca’s rival who emulous swam on the open sea when for pride the pair of you proved the floods and wantonly dared in waters deep to risk your lives no living man or lief or loath from your labor dire could you dissuade from swimming the main oceantides with your arms ye covered with strenuous hands the seastreets

achieved so ween i for thee a worse adventure  though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been in struggle grim  if grendel’s approach thou darst await through the watch of night” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “what a deal hast uttered dear my unferth drunken with beer of breca now told of his triumph truth i claim it that i had more of might in the sea than any man else more oceanendurance we twain had talked in time of youth and made our boast  we were merely boys striplings still  to stake our lives far at sea and so we performed it naked swords as we swam along we held in hand with hope to guard us against the whales not a whit from me could he float afar o’er the flood of waves haste o’er the billows nor him i abandoned together we twain on the tides abode five nights full till the flood divided us churning waves and chillest weather darkling night and the northern wind ruthless rushed on us rough was the surge now the wrath of the seafish rose apace yet me ‘gainst the monsters my mailed coat hard and handlinked help afforded  battlesark braided my breast to ward garnished with gold there grasped me firm and haled me to bottom the hated foe with grimmest gripe ‘twas granted me though to pierce the monster with point of sword with blade of battle huge beast of the sea was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine me thus often the evil monsters thronging threatened with thrust of my sword the darling i dealt them due return nowise had they bliss from their booty then to devour their victim vengeful creatures seated to banquet at bottom of sea but at break of day by

speedily now shall i prove him the prowess and pride of the geats shall bid him battle blithe to mead go he that listeth when light of dawn this morrow morning o’er men of earth etherrobed sun from

loud resounding with winsome words came wealhtheow forth queen of hrothgar heedful of courtesy golddecked greeting the guests in hall and the highborn lady handed the cup first to the eastdanes’ heir and warden bade him be blithe at the beercarouse the land’s beloved one lustily took he banquet and beaker battlefamed king through the hall then went the helmings’ lady to younger and older everywhere carried the cup till come the moment when the ringgraced queen the royalhearted to beowulf bore the beaker of mead she greeted the geats’ lord god she thanked in wisdom’s words that her will was granted that at last on a hero her hope could lean for comfort in terrors the cup he took hardyinwar from wealhtheow’s hand and answer uttered the eagerforcombat beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “this was my thought when my thanes and i bent to the ocean and entered our boat that i would work the will of your people fully or fighting fall in death in fiend’s gripe fast i am firm to do an earl’s brave deed or end the days of this life of mine in the meadhall here” well these words to the woman seemed beowulf’s battleboast  bright with gold the stately dame by her spouse sat down again as erst began in hall warriors’ wassail and words of power the proudband’s revel till presently the son of healfdene hastened to seek rest for the night he knew there waited fight for the fiend in that festal hall when the sheen of the sun they saw no more and dusk of night sank darkling nigh and shadowy shapes came striding on wan under welkin the warriors rose man to man he made harangue hrothgar to beowulf bade him hail let him wield the wine hall a word he added “never to any man erst i trusted since i could heave up hand and shield this noble danehall till now to thee have now and hold this house unpeered remember thy glory thy might declare watch for the foe no wish shall fail thee if thou bidest the battle with boldwon life” then hrothgar went with his herotrain defenceofscyldings forth from hall fain would the warlord wealhtheow seek couch of his queen the kingofglory against this grendel a guard had set so heroes heard a halldefender who warded the monarch and watched for the monster in truth the geats’ prince gladly trusted his mettle his might the mercy of god cast off then his corselet of iron helmet from head to his henchman gave  choicest of weapons  the wellchased sword bidding him guard the gear of battle spake then his vaunt the valiant man beowulf geat ere the bed be sought “of force in fight no feebler i count me in grim wardeeds than grendel deems him not with the sword then to sleep of death his life will i give though it lie in my power no skill is his to strike against me my shield to hew though he hardy be bold in battle we both this night shall spurn the sword if he seek me here unweaponed for war let wisest god sacred lord on which side soever doom decree as he deemeth right” reclined then the chieftain and cheekpillows held the head of the earl while all about him seamen hardy on hallbeds sank none of them thought that thence their steps to the folk and fastness that fostered them to the land they loved would lead them back full well they wist that on warriors many battledeath seized in the banquethall of danish clan but comfort and help warweal weaving to weder folk the master gave that by might of one over their enemy all prevailed by single strength in sooth ‘tis told that highest god o’er human kind hath wielded ever  thro’ wan night striding came the walkerinshadow warriors slept whose hest was to guard the gabled hall  all save one ‘twas widely known that against god’s will the ghostly ravager him   could not hurl to haunts of darkness wakeful ready with warrior’s wrath bold he bided the battle’s issue then from the moorland by misty crags with god’s wrath laden grendel came the monster was minded of mankind now sundry to seize in the stately house under welkin he walked till the winepalace there goldhall of men he gladly discerned flashing with fretwork not first time this that he the home of hrothgar sought  yet ne’er in his lifeday late or early such hardy heroes such hallthanes found to the house the warrior walked apace parted from peace   the portal opended though with forged bolts fast when his fists had struck it and baleful he burst in his blatant rage the house’s mouth all hastily then o’er fairpaved floor the fiend trod on ireful he strode there streamed from his eyes fearful flashes like flame to see he spied in hall the heroband kin and clansmen clustered asleep hardy liegemen then laughed his heart for the monster was minded ere morn should dawn savage to sever the soul of each life from body since lusty banquet waited his will but wyrd forbade him to seize any more of men on earth after that evening eagerly watched hygelac’s kinsman his cursed foe how he would fare in fell attack not that the monster was minded to pause straightway he seized a sleeping warrior for the first and tore him fiercely asunder the boneframe bit drank blood in streams swallowed him piecemeal swiftly thus the lifeless corse was clear devoured e’en feet and hands then farther he hied for the hardy hero with hand he grasped felt for the foe with fiendish claw for the hero reclining  who clutched it boldly prompt to answer propped on his arm soon then saw that shepherdofevils that never he met in this middleworld in the ways of earth another wight with heavier handgripe at heart he feared sorrowed in soul  none the sooner escaped fain would he flee his fastness seek the den of devils no doings now such as oft he had done in days of old then bethought him the hardy hygelacthane of his boast at evening up he bounded grasped firm his foe whose fingers cracked the fiend made off but the earl close followed the monster meant  if he might at all  to fling himself free and far away fly to the fens  knew his fingers’ power in the gripe of the grim one gruesome march to heorot this monster of harm had made din filled the room the danes were bereft castledwellers and clansmen all earls of their ale angry were both those savage hallguards the house resounded wonder it was the winehall firm in the strain of their struggle stood to earth the fair house fell not too fast it was within and without by its iron bands craftily clamped though there crashed from sill many a meadbench  men have told me  gay with gold where the grim foes wrestled so well had weened the wisest scyldings that not ever at all might any man that bonedecked brave house break asunder crush by craft  unless clasp of fire in smoke engulfed it  again uprose din redoubled danes of the north with fear and frenzy were filled each one who from the wall that wailing heard god’s foe sounding his grisly song cry of the conquered clamorous pain from captive of hell too closely held him he who of men in might was strongest in that same day of this our life not in any wise would the earls’defence suffer that slaughterous stranger to live useless deeming his days and years to men on earth now many an earl of beowulf brandished blade ancestral fain the life of their lord to shield their praised prince if power were theirs never they knew  as they neared the foe hardyhearted heroes of war aiming their swords on every side the accursed to kill  no keenest blade no farest of falchions fashioned on earth could harm or hurt that hideous fiend he was safe by his spells from sword of battle from edge of iron yet his end and parting on that same day of this our life woful should be and his wandering soul far off flit to the fiends’ domain soon he found who in former days harmful in heart and hated of god on many a man such murder wrought that the frame of his body failed him now for him the keensouled kinsman of hygelac held in hand hateful alive was each to other the outlaw dire took mortal hurt a mighty wound showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked and the boneframe burst to beowulf now the glory was given and grendel thence deathsick his den in the dark moor sought noisome abode he knew too well that here was the last of life an end of his days on earth  to all the danes by that bloody battle the boon had come from ravage had rescued the roving stranger hrothgar’s hall the hardy and wise one had purged it anew his nightwork pleased him his deed and its honor to eastern danes had the valiant geat his vaunt made good all their sorrow and ills assuaged their bale of battle borne so long and all the dole they erst endured pain aplenty  ‘twas proof of this when the hardyinfight a hand laid down arm and shoulder  all indeed of grendel’s gripe  ‘neath the gabled roof’ many at morning as men have told me warriors gathered the gifthall round folkleaders faring from far and near o’er widestretched ways the wonder to view trace of the traitor not troublous seemed the enemy’s end to any man who saw by the gait of the graceless foe how the wearyhearted away from thence baffled in battle and banned his steps deathmarked dragged to the devils’ mere bloody the billows were boiling there turbid the tide of tumbling waves horribly seething with swordblood hot by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor laid forlorn his life adown his heathen souland hell received it home then rode the hoary clansmen from that merry journey and many a youth on horses white the hardy warriors back from the mere then beowulf’s glory eager they echoed and all averred that from sea to sea or south or north there was no other in earth’s domain under vault of heaven more valiant found of warriors none more worthy to rule on their lord beloved they laid no slight gracious hrothgar a good king he from time to time the triedinbattle their gray steeds set to gallop amain and ran a race when the road seemed fair from time to time a thane of the king who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses stored with sagas and songs of old bound word to word in wellknit rime welded his lay this warrior soon of beowulf’s quest right cleverly sang and artfully added an excellent tale in wellranged words of the warlike deeds he had heard in saga of sigemund strange the story he said it all  the waelsing’s wanderings wide his struggles which never were told to tribes of men the feuds and the frauds save to fitela only when of these doings he deigned to speak uncle to nephew as ever the twain stood side by side in stress of war and multitude of the monster kind they had felled with their swords of sigemund grew when he passed from life no little praise for the doughtyincombat a dragon killed that herded the hoard   under hoary rock the atheling dared the deed alone fearful quest nor was fitela there yet so it befell his falchion pierced that wondrous worm  on the wall it struck best blade the dragon died in its blood thus had the dreadone by daring achieved over the ringhoard to rule at will himself to pleasure a seaboat he loaded and bore on its bosom the beaming gold son of waels the worm was consumed he had of all heroes the highest renown among races of men this refugeofwarriors for deeds of daring that decked his name since the hand and heart of heremod grew slack in battle he swiftly banished to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow had lamed him too long a load of care to earls and athelings all he proved oft indeed in earlier days for the warrior’s wayfaring wise men mourned who had hoped of him help from harm and bale and had thought their sovran’s son would thrive follow his father his folk protect the hoard and the stronghold heroes’ land home of scyldings  but here thanes said the kinsman of hygelac kinder seemed to all the other   was urged to crime and afresh to the race   the fallow roads by swift steeds measured the morning sun was climbing higher clansmen hastened to the highbuilt hall those hardyminded the wonder to witness warden of treasure crowned with glory the king himself with stately band from the bridebower strode and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens measured the path to the meadhouse fair hrothgar spake  to the hall he went stood by the steps the steep roof saw garnished with gold and grendel’s hand “for the sight i see to the sovran ruler be speedy thanks a throng of sorrows i have borne from grendel but god still works wonder on wonder the wardenofglory it was but now that i never more for woes that weighed on me waited help long as i lived when laved in blood stood swordgorestained this stateliest house  widespread woe for wise men all who had no hope to hinder ever foes infernal and fiendish sprites from havoc in hall this hero now by the wielder’s might a work has done that not all of us erst could ever do by wile and wisdom lo well can she say whoso of women this warrior bore among sons of men if still she liveth that the god of the ages was good to her in the birth of her bairn now beowulf thee of heroes best i shall heartily love as mine own my son preserve thou ever this kinship new thou shalt never lack wealth of the world that i wield as mine full oft for less have i largess showered my precious hoard on a punier man less stout in struggle thyself hast now fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure through all the ages as ever he did well may the wielder reward thee still” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “this work of war most willingly we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared force of the foe fain too were i hadst thou but seen himself what time the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall swiftly i thought in strongest gripe on his bed of death to bind him down that he in the hent of this hand of mine should breathe his last but he broke away him i might not  the maker willed not  hinder from flight and firm enough hold the lifedestroyer too sturdy was he the ruthless in running for rescue however he left behind him his hand in pledge arm and shoulder nor aught of help could the cursed one thus procure at all none the longer liveth he loathsome fiend sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him tightly grasped in gripe of anguish in baleful bonds where bide he must evil outlaw such awful doom as the mighty maker shall mete him out” more silent seemed the son of ecglaf in boastful speech of his battledeeds since athelings all through the earl’s great prowess beheld that hand on the high roof gazing foeman’s fingers  the forepart of each of the sturdy nails to steel was likest  heathen’s “handspear” hostile warrior’s claw uncanny ‘twas clear they said that him no blade of the brave could touch how keen soever or cut away that battlehand bloody from baneful foe there was hurry and hest in heorot now for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng of men and women the winehall to cleanse the guestroom to garnish goldgay shone the hangings that were wove on the wall and wonders many to delight each mortal that looks upon them though braced within by iron bands that building bright was broken sorely rent were its hinges the roof alone held safe and sound when seared with crime the fiendish foe his flight essayed of life despairing  no light thing that the flight for safety  essay it who will forced of fate he shall find his way to the refuge ready for race of man for soulpossessors and sons of earth and there his body on bed of death shall rest after revel arrived was the hour when to hall proceeded healfdene’s son the king himself would sit to banquet ne’er heard i of host in haughtier throng more graciously gathered round giverofrings bowed then to bench those bearersofglory fain of the feasting featly received many a meadcup the mightyinspirit kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall hrothgar and hrothulf heorot now was filled with friends the folk of scyldings ne’er yet had tried the traitor’s deed to beowulf gave the bairn of healfdene a goldwove banner guerdon of triumph broidered battleflag breastplate and helmet and a splendid sword was seen of many borne to the brave one beowulf took cup in hall   for such costly gifts he suffered no shame in that soldier throng for i heard of few heroes in heartier mood with four such gifts so fashioned with gold on the alebench honoring others thus o’er the roof of the helmet high a ridge wound with wires kept ward o’er the head lest the relictoffiles   should

heroes that hard fight repaid with steeds and treasures contemned by none who is willing to say the sooth aright and the lord of earls to each that came with beowulf over the briny ways an heirloom there at the alebench gave precious gift and the price   bade pay in gold for him whom grendel erst murdered  and fain of them more had killed had not wisest god their wyrd averted and the

ancient gold heaped from hoard  the hardy scylding battlethane best   on his balefire lay all on the pyre were plain to see the gory sark the gilded swinecrest boar of hard iron and athelings many

seen by many an earl when eve should come and hrothgar homeward hasten away royal to rest the room was guarded by an army of earls as erst was done they bared the benchboards abroad they spread beds and bolsters  one beercarouser in danger of doom lay down in the hall  at their heads they set their shields of war bucklers bright on the bench were there over each atheling easy to see the high battlehelmet the haughty spear the corselet of rings ‘twas their custom so ever to be for battle prepared at home or harrying which it were even as oft as evil threatened their sovran king  they were clansmen good then sank they to sleep with sorrow one bought his rest of the evening  as ofttime had happened when grendel guarded that golden hall evil wrought till his end drew nigh slaughter for sins ‘twas seen and told how an avenger survived the fiend as was learned afar the livelong time after that grim fight grendel’s mother monster of women mourned her woe she was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters cold seacourses since cain cut down with edge of the sword his only brother his father’s offspring outlawed he fled marked with murder from men’s delights warded the wilds  there woke from him such fatesent ghosts as grendel who warwolf horrid at heorot found a warrior watching and waiting the fray with whom the grisly one grappled amain but the man remembered his mighty power the glorious gift that god had sent him in his maker’s mercy put his trust for comfort and help so he conquered the foe felled the fiend who fled abject reft of joy to the realms of death mankind’s foe and his mother now gloomy and grim would go that quest of sorrow the death of her son to avenge to heorot came she where helmeted danes slept in the hall too soon came back old ills of the earls when in she burst the mother of grendel less grim though that terror e’en as terror of woman in war is less might of maid than of men in arms when hammerforged the falchion hard sword gorestained through swine of the helm crested with keen blade carves amain then was in hall the hardedge drawn the swords on the settles   and shields amany firm held in hand nor helmet minded nor harness of mail whom that horror seized haste was hers she would hie afar and save her life when the liegemen saw her yet a single atheling up she seized fast and firm as she fled to the moor he was for hrothgar of heroes the dearest of trusty vassals betwixt the seas whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous in battle brave  nor was beowulf there another house had been held apart after giving of gold for the geat renowned  uproar filled heorot the hand all had viewed bloodflecked she bore with her bale was returned dole in the dwellings ‘twas dire exchange where dane and geat were doomed to give the lives of loved ones longtried king the hoary hero at heart was sad when he knew his noble no more lived and dead indeed was his dearest thane to his bower was beowulf brought in haste dauntless victor as daylight broke along with his earls the atheling lord with his clansmen came where the king abode waiting to see if the wielderofall would turn this tale of trouble and woe strode o’er floor the famedinstrife with his handcompanions  the hall resounded  wishing to greet the wise old king ingwines’ lord he asked if the night had passed in peace to the prince’s mind hrothgar spake helmetofscyldings “ask not of pleasure pain is renewed to danish folk dead is aeschere of yrmenlaf the elder brother my sage adviser and stay in council shouldercomrade in stress of fight when

fear where thou findest out that sinflecked being seek if thou dare i will reward thee for waging this fight with ancient treasure as erst i did with winding gold if thou winnest back” beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “sorrow not sage it beseems us better friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them each of us all must his end abide in the ways of the world so win who may glory ere death when his days are told that is the warrior’s worthiest doom rise o realmwarder ride we anon and mark the trail of the mother of grendel no harbor shall hide her  heed my promise  enfolding of field or forested mountain or floor of the flood let her flee where she will but thou this day endure in patience as i ween thou wilt thy woes each one” leaped up the graybeard god he thanked mighty lord for the man’s brave words for hrothgar soon a horse was saddled wavemaned steed the sovran wise stately rode on his shieldarmed men followed in force the footprints led along the woodland widely seen a path o’er the plain where she passed and trod the murky moor of menatarms she bore the bravest and best one dead him who with hrothgar the homestead ruled on then went the athelingborn o’er stonecliffs steep and strait defiles narrow passes and unknown ways headlands sheer and the haunts of the nicors foremost he   fared a few at his side of the wiser men the ways to scan till he found in a flash the forested hill hanging over the hoary rock a woful wood the waves below were dyed in blood the danish men had sorrow of soul and for scyldings all for many a hero ‘twas hard to bear ill for earls when aeschere’s head they found by the flood on the foreland there waves were welling the warriors saw hot with blood but the horn sang oft battlesong bold the band sat down and watched on the water wormlike things seadragons strange that sounded the deep and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness  such as oft essay at hour of morn on the roadofsails their ruthless quest  and seasnakes and monsters these started away swollen and savage that song to hear that warhorn’s blast the warden of geats with bolt from bow then balked of life of wavework one monster amid its heart went the keen warshaft in water it seemed less doughty in swimming whom death had seized swift on the billows with boarspears well hooked and barbed it was hard beset done to death and dragged on the headland waveroamer wondrous warriors viewed the grisly guest then girt him beowulf in martial mail nor mourned for his life his breastplate broad and bright of hues woven by hand should the waters try well could it ward the warrior’s body that battle should break on his breast in vain nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe and the helmet white that his head protected was destined to dare the deeps of the flood through wavewhirl win ‘twas wound with chains decked with gold as in days of yore the weaponsmith worked it wondrously with swineforms set it that swords nowise brandished in battle could bite that helm nor was that the meanest of mighty helps which hrothgar’s orator offered at need “hrunting” they named the hilted sword of oldtime heirlooms easily first iron was its edge all etched with poison with battleblood hardened nor blenched it at fight in hero’s hand who held it ever on paths of peril prepared to go to folkstead   of foes not first time this it was destined to do a daring task for he bore not in mind the bairn of ecglaf sturdy and strong that speech he had made drunk with wine now this weapon he lent to a stouter swordsman himself though durst not under welter of waters wager his life as loyal liegeman so lost he his glory honor of earls with the other not so who girded him now for the grim encounter beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “have mind thou honored offspring of healfdene goldfriend of men now i go on this quest sovran wise what once was said if in thy cause it came that i should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide to me though fallen in father’s place be guardian thou to this group of my thanes my warriorfriends if war should seize me and the goodly gifts thou gavest me hrothgar beloved to hygelac send geatland’s king may ken by the

this heirloom precious hard of edge with hrunting i seek doom of glory or death shall take me” after these words the wedergeat lord boldly hastened biding never answer at all the ocean floods closed o’er the hero long while of the day fled ere he felt the floor of the sea soon found the fiend who the flooddomain swordhungry held these hundred winters greedy and grim that some guest from above some man was raiding her monsterrealm she grasped out for him with grisly claws and the warrior seized yet scathed she not his body hale the breastplate hindered as she strove to shatter the sark of war the linked harness with loathsome hand then bore this brinewolf when bottom she touched the lord of rings to the lair she haunted whiles vainly he strove though his valor held weapon to wield against wondrous monsters that sore beset him seabeasts many tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail and swarmed on the stranger but soon he marked he was now in some hall he knew not which where water never could work him harm nor through the roof could reach him ever fangs of the flood firelight he saw beams of a blaze that brightly shone then the warrior was ware of that wolfofthedeep merewife monstrous for mighty stroke he swung his blade and the blow withheld not then sang on her head that seemly blade its warsong wild but the warrior found the lightofbattle   was loath to bite to harm the heart its hard edge failed the noble at need yet had known of old strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven doomed men’s fightinggear first time this for the gleaming blade that its glory fell firm still stood nor failed in valor heedful of high deeds hygelac’s kinsman flung away fretted sword featly jewelled the angry earl on earth it lay steeledged and stiff his strength he trusted handgripe of might so man shall do whenever in war he weens to earn him lasting fame nor fears for his life seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat the geatish warprince grendel’s mother flung then the fierce one filled with wrath his deadly foe that she fell to ground swift on her part she paid him back with grisly grasp and grappled with him spent with struggle stumbled the warrior fiercest of fightingmen fell adown on the hallguest she hurled herself hent her short sword broad and brownedged   the bairn to avenge the soleborn son  on his shoulder lay braided breastmail barring death withstanding entrance of edge or blade life would have ended for ecgtheow’s son under wide earth for that earl of geats had his armor of war not aided him battlenet hard and holy god wielded the victory wisest maker the lord of heaven allowed his cause and easily rose the earl erect ‘mid the battlegear saw he a blade triumphant oldsword of eotens with edge of proof warriors’ heirloom weapon unmatched  save only ‘twas more than other men to bandyofbattle could bear at all  as the giants had wrought it ready and keen seized then its chainhilt the scyldings’ chieftain bold and battlegrim brandished the sword reckless of life and so wrathfully smote that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard her bonerings breaking the blade pierced through that fatedone’s flesh to floor she sank bloody the blade he was blithe of his deed then blazed forth light ‘twas bright within as when from the sky there shines unclouded heaven’s candle the hall he scanned by the wall then went he his weapon raised high by its hilts the hygelacthane angry and eager that edge was not useless to the warrior now he wished with speed grendel to guerdon for grim raids many for the war he waged on westerndanes oftener far than an only time when of hrothgar’s hearthcompanions he slew in slumber in sleep devoured fifteen men of the folk of danes and as many others outward bore his horrible prey well paid for that the wrathful prince for now prone he saw grendel stretched there spent with war spoiled of life so scathed had left him heorot’s battle the body sprang far when after death it endured the blow swordstroke savage that severed its head soon   then saw the sage companions who waited with hrothgar watching the flood that the tossing waters turbid grew bloodstained the mere old men together hoaryhaired of the hero spake the warrior would not they weened again proud of conquest come to seek their mighty master to many it seemed the wolfofthewaves had won his life the ninth hour came the noble scyldings left the headland homeward went the goldfriend of men   but the guests sat on stared at the surges sick in heart and wished yet weened not their winsome lord again to see now that sword began from blood of the fight in battledroppings warblade to wane ‘twas a wondrous thing that all of it melted as ice is wont when frosty fetters the father loosens unwinds the wavebonds wielding all seasons and times the true god he nor took from that dwelling the duke of the geats precious things though a plenty he saw save only the head and that hilt withal blazoned with jewels the blade had melted burned was the bright sword her blood was so hot so poisoned the hellsprite who perished within there soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat downfall of demons updove through the flood the clashing waters were cleansed now waste of waves where the wandering fiend her lifedays left and this lapsing world swam then to strand the sailors’refuge sturdyinspirit of seabooty glad of burden brave he bore with him went then to greet him and god they thanked the thaneband choice of their chieftain blithe that safe and sound they could see him again soon from the hardy one helmet and armor deftly they doffed now drowsed the mere water ‘neath welkin with warblood stained forth they fared by the footpaths thence merry at heart the highways measured wellknown roads courageous men carried the head from the cliff by the sea an arduous task for all the band the firm in fight since four were needed on the shaftofslaughter   strenuously to bear to the goldhall grendel’s head so presently to the palace there foemen fearless fourteen geats marching came their masterofclan mighty amid them the meadowways trod strode then within the sovran thane fearless in fight of fame renowned hardy hero hrothgar to greet and next by the hair into hall was borne grendel’s head where the henchmen were drinking an awe to clan and queen alike a monster of marvel the men looked on beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “lo now this seabooty son of healfdene lord of scyldings we’ve lustily brought thee sign of glory thou seest it here not lightly did i with my life escape in war under water this work i essayed with endless effort and even so my strength had been lost had the lord not shielded me not a whit could i with hrunting do in work of war though the weapon is good

while went to his host that darling of danes the doughty atheling to highseat hastened and hrothgar greeted beowulf spake bairn of ecgtheow “lo we seafarers say our will farcome men that we fain would

southdanes to settle their feud themselves with grendel now god be thanked that safe and sound i can see thee now” beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow “‘tis known and unhidden hygelac lord to many men that meeting of ours struggle grim between grendel and me which we fought on the field where full too many sorrows he wrought for the scyldingvictors evils unending these all i avenged no boast can be from breed of grendel any on earth for that uproar at dawn from the longestlived of the loathsome race in fleshly fold  but first i went hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts where healfdene’s

the meed of my might he made me gifts healfdene’s heir for my own disposal now to thee my prince i proffer them all gladly give them thy grace alone can find me favor few indeed have i of kinsmen save

such gift the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen  thus showed his strain the son of ecgtheow as a man remarked for mighty deeds and acts of honor at ale he slew not comrade or kin nor cruel his mood though of sons of earth his strength was greatest a glorious gift that god had sent the splendid leader long was he spurned and worthless by geatish warriors held him at mead the masterofclans failed full oft to favor at all slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him profitless prince but payment came to the warrior honored for all his woes  then the bulwarkofearls   bade bring within hardy chieftain hrethel’s heirloom garnished with gold no geat e’er knew in shape of a sword a statelier prize the brand he laid in beowulf’s lap and of hides assigned him seven thousand with house and highseat they held in common land alike by their line of birth inheritance home but higher the king because of his rule o’er the realm itself now further it fell with the flight of years with harryings horrid that hygelac perished and heardred too by hewing of swords under the shieldwall slaughtered lay when him at the van of his victorfolk sought hardy heroes heathoscilfings in arms o’erwhelming hereric’s nephew then beowulf came as king this broad realm to wield and he ruled it well fifty winters   a wise old prince warding his land until one began in the dark of night a dragon to rage in the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded in the stonebarrow steep a strait path reached it unknown to mortals some man however came by chance that cave within to the heathen hoard   in hand he took a golden goblet nor gave he it back stole with it away while the watcher slept by thievish wiles for the warden’s wrath prince and people must pay betimes that way he went with no will of his own in danger of life to the dragon’s hoard but for pressure of peril some prince’s thane he fled in fear the fatal scourge seeking shelter a sinful man and entered in at the awful sight tottered that guest and terror seized him yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon from fright and fear ere he fled away and took the cup from that treasurehoard of such besides there was store enough heirlooms old the earth below which some earl forgotten in ancient years left the last of his lofty race heedfully there had hidden away dearest treasure for death of yore had hurried all hence and he alone left to live the last of the clan weeping his friends yet wished to bide warding the treasure his one delight though brief his respite the barrow newready to strand and seawaves stood anear hard by the headland hidden and closed there laid within it his lordly heirlooms and heaped hoard of heavy gold that warden of rings few words he spake “now hold thou earth since heroes may not what earls have owned lo erst from thee brave men brought it but battledeath seized and cruel killing my clansmen all robbed them of life and a liegeman’s joys none have i left to lift the sword or to cleanse the carven cup of price beaker bright my brave are gone and the helmet hard all haughty with gold shall part from its plating polishers sleep who could brighten and burnish the battlemask and those weeds of war that were wont to brave over bicker of shields the bite of steel rust with their bearer the ringed mail fares not far with famous chieftain at side of hero no harp’s delight no gleewood’s gladness no good hawk now flies through the hall nor horses fleet stamp in the burgstead battle and death the flower of my race have reft away” mournful of mood thus he moaned his woe alone for them all and unblithe wept by day and by night till death’s fell wave o’erwhelmed his heart his hoardofbliss that old illdoer open found who blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth naked foedragon flying by night folded in fire the folk of earth dread him sore ‘tis his doom to seek hoard in the graves and heathen gold to watch manywintered nor wins he thereby powerful this plagueofthepeople thus held the house of the hoard in earth three hundred winters till one aroused wrath in his breast to the ruler bearing that costly cup and the king implored for bond of peace so the barrow was plundered borne off was booty his boon was granted that wretched man and his ruler saw first time what was fashioned in faroff days when the dragon awoke new woe was kindled o’er the stone he snuffed the starkheart found footprint of foe who so far had gone in his hidden craft by the creature’s head  so may the undoomed easily flee evils and exile if only he gain the grace of the wielder  that warden of gold o’er the ground went seeking greedy to find the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep savage and burning the barrow he circled all without nor was any there none in the waste yet war he desired was eager for battle the barrow he entered sought the cup and discovered soon that some one of mortals had searched his treasure his lordly gold the guardian waited illenduring till evening came boiling with wrath was the barrow’s keeper and fain with flame the foe to pay for the dear cup’s loss  now day was fled as the worm had wished by its wall no more was it glad to bide but burning flew folded in flame a fearful beginning for sons of the soil and soon it came in the doom of their lord to a dreadful end then the baleful fiend its fire belched out and bright homes burned the blaze stood high all landsfolk frighting no living thing would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew wide was the dragon’s warring seen its fiendish fury far and near as the grim destroyer those geatish people hated and hounded to hidden lair to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn folk of the land it had lapped in flame with bale and brand in its barrow it trusted its battling and bulwarks that boast was vain to beowulf then the bale was told quickly and truly the king’s own home of buildings the best in brandwaves melted that giftthrone of geats to the good old man sad in heart ‘twas heaviest sorrow the sage assumed that his sovran god he had angered breaking ancient law and embittered the lord his breast within with black thoughts welled as his wont was never the folk’s own fastness that fiery dragon with flame had destroyed and the stronghold all washed by waves but the warlike king prince of the weders plotted vengeance warriors’bulwark he bade them work all of iron  the earl’s commander  a warshield wondrous well he knew that forestwood against fire were worthless linden could aid not  atheling brave he was fated to finish this fleeting life his days on earth and the dragon with him though long it had watched o’er the wealth of the hoard  shame he reckoned it sharerofrings to follow the flyerafar with a host a broadflung band nor the battle feared he nor deemed he dreadful the dragon’s warring its vigor and valor ventures desperate he had passed aplenty and perils of war contestcrash since conqueror proud hrothgar’s hall he had wholly purged and in grapple had killed the kin of grendel loathsome breed not least was that of handtohand fights where hygelac fell when the ruler of geats in rush of battle lord of his folk in the frisian land son of hrethel by sworddraughts died by brands downbeaten thence beowulf fled through strength of himself and his swimming power though alone and his arms were laden with thirty coats of mail when he came to the sea nor yet might hetwaras   haughtily boast their craft of contest who carried against him shields to the fight but few escaped from strife with the hero to seek their homes then swam over ocean ecgtheow’s son lonely and sorrowful seeking his land where hygd made him offer of hoard and realm rings and royalseat reckoning naught the strength of her son to save their kingdom from hostile hordes after hygelac’s death no sooner for this could the stricken ones in any wise move that atheling’s mind over young heardred’s head as lord and ruler of all the realm to be yet the hero upheld him with helpful words aided in honor till older grown he wielded the wedergeats  wandering exiles sought him o’er seas the sons of ohtere who had spurned the sway of the scylfings’helmet the bravest and best that broke the rings in swedish land of the seakings’ line haughty hero   hence heardred’s end for shelter he gave them sworddeath came the blade’s fell blow to bairn of hygelac but the son of ongentheow sought again house and home when heardred fell leaving beowulf lord of geats and giftseat’s master  a good king he the fall of his lord he was fain to requite in after days and to eadgils he proved friend to the friendless and forces sent over the sea to the son of ohtere weapons and warriors well repaid he those carepaths cold when the king he slew thus safe through struggles the son of ecgtheow had passed a plenty through perils dire with daring deeds till this day was come that doomed him now with the dragon to strive with comrades eleven the lord of geats swollen in rage went seeking the dragon he had heard whence all the harm arose and the killing of clansmen that cup of price on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder in the throng was this one thirteenth man starter of all the strife and ill careladen captive cringing thence forced and reluctant he led them on till he came in ken of that cavernhall the barrow delved near billowy surges flood of ocean within ‘twas full of wiregold and jewels a jealous warden warrior trusty the treasures held lurked in his lair not light the task of entrance for any of earthborn men sat on the headland the hero king spake words of hail to his hearthcompanions goldfriend of geats all gloomy his soul wavering deathbound wyrd full nigh stood ready to greet the grayhaired man to seize his soulhoard sunder apart life and body not long would be the warrior’s spirit enwound with flesh beowulf spake the bairn of ecgtheow “through store of struggles i strove in youth mighty feuds i mind them all i was seven years old when the sovran of rings friendofhisfolk from my father took me had me and held me hrethel the king with food and fee faithful in kinship ne’er while i lived there he loathlier found me bairn in the burg than his birthright sons herebeald and haethcyn and hygelac mine for the eldest of these by unmeet chance by kinsman’s deed was the deathbed strewn when haethcyn killed him with horny bow his own dear liege laid low with an arrow missed the mark and his mate shot down one brother the other with bloody shaft a feeless fight   and a fearful sin horror to hrethel yet hard as it was unavenged must the atheling die too awful it is for an aged man to bide and bear that his bairn so young rides on the gallows a rime he makes sorrowsong for his son there hanging as rapture of ravens no rescue now can come from the old disabled man still is he minded as morning breaks of the heir gone elsewhere   another he hopes not he will bide to see his burg within as ward for his wealth now the one has found doom of death that the deed incurred forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son winehall waste and windswept chambers reft of revel the rider sleepeth the hero farhidden   no harp resounds in the courts no wassail as once was heard “then he goes to his chamber a griefsong chants alone for his lost too large all seems homestead and house so the helmetofweders hid in his heart for herebeald waves of woe no way could he take to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul nor e’en could he harass that hero at all with loathing deed though he loved him not and so for the sorrow his soul endured men’s gladness he gave up and god’s light chose lands and cities he left his sons as the wealthy do when he went from earth there was strife and struggle ‘twixt swede and geat o’er the width of waters war arose hard battlehorror when hrethel died and ongentheow’s offspring grew strifekeen bold nor brooked o’er the seas pact of peace but pushed their hosts to harass in hatred by hreosnabeorh men of my folk for that feud had vengeance for woful war ‘tis widely known though one of them bought it with blood of his heart a bargain hard for haethcyn proved fatal that fray for the firstofgeats at morn i heard was the murderer killed by kinsman for kinsman   with clash of sword when ongentheow met eofor there wide split the warhelm wan he fell hoary scylfing the hand that smote him of feud was mindful nor flinched from the deathblow  “for all that he   gave me my gleaming sword repaid him at war  such power i wielded  for lordly treasure with land he entrusted me homestead and house he had no need from swedish realm or from speardane folk or from men of the gifths to get him help  some warrior worse for wage to buy ever i fought in the front of

broken by brawny gripe his heartwaves stilled  the swordedge now hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive” beowulf spake and a battlevow made his last of all “i have lived through many wars in my youth now once again old folkdefender feud will i seek do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer forth from his cavern come to fight me” then hailed he the helmeted heroes all for the last time greeting his liegemen dear comrades of war “i should carry no weapon no sword to the serpent if sure i knew how with such enemy else my vows i could gain as i did in grendel’s day but fire in this fight i must fear me now and poisonous breath so i bring with me breastplate and board   from the barrow’s keeper no footbreadth flee i one fight shall end our war by the wall as wyrd allots all

wounds wait ye the finish the fight is not yours nor meet for any but me alone to measure might with this monster here and play the hero hardily i shall win that wealth or war shall seize cruel killing your king and lord” up stood then with shield the sturdy champion stayed by the strength of his single manhood and hardy ‘neath helmet his harness bore under cleft of the cliffs no coward’s path soon spied by the wall that warrior chief survivor of many a victoryfield where foemen fought with furious clashings an arch of stone and within a stream that broke from the barrow the brooklet’s wave was hot with fire the hoard that way he never could hope unharmed to near or endure those deeps   for the dragon’s flame then let from his breast for he burst with rage the wedergeat prince a word outgo stormed the starkheart stern went ringing and clear his cry ‘neath the cliffrocks gray the hoardguard heard a human voice his rage was enkindled no respite now for pact of peace the poisonbreath of that foul worm first came forth from the cave hot reekoffight the rocks resounded stout by the stoneway his shield he raised lord of the geats against the loathedone while with courage keen that coiled foe came seeking strife the sturdy king had drawn his sword not dull of edge heirloom old and each of the two felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood stoutly stood with his shield highraised the warrior king as the worm now coiled together amain the mailedone waited now spire by spire fast sped and glided that blazing serpent the shield protected soul and body a shorter while for the heroking than his heart desired could his will have wielded the welcome respite but once in his life but wyrd denied it and victory’s honors  his arm he lifted lord of the geats the grim foe smote with atheling’s heirloom its edge was turned brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly than its noble master had need of then in his baleful stress  then the barrow’s keeper waxed full wild for that weighty blow cast deadly flames wide drove and far those vicious fires no victor’s glory the geats’ lord boasted his brand had failed naked in battle as never it should excellent iron  ‘twas no easy path that ecgtheow’s honored heir must tread over the plain to the place of the foe for against his will he must win a home elsewhere far as must all men leaving this lapsing life  not long it was ere those champions grimly closed again the hoardguard was heartened high heaved his breast once more and by peril was pressed again enfolded in flames the folkcommander nor yet about him his band of comrades sons of athelings armed stood with warlike front to the woods they bent them their lives to save but the soul of one with care was cumbered kinship true can never be marred in a noble mind wiglaf his name was weohstan’s son lindenthane loved the lord of scylfings aelfhere’s kinsman his king he now saw with heat under helmet hard oppressed he minded the prizes his prince had given him wealthy seat of the waegmunding line and folkrights that his father owned not long he lingered the linden yellow his shield he seized the old sword he drew  as heirloom of eanmund earthdwellers knew it who was slain by the swordedge son of ohtere friendless exile erst in fray killed by weohstan who won for his kin brownbright helmet breastplate ringed old sword of eotens onela’s gift weeds of war of the warriorthane battlegear brave though a brother’s child had been felled the feud was unfelt by onela for winters this wargear weohstan kept breastplate and board till his bairn had grown earlship to earn as the old sire did then he gave him mid geats the gear of battle portion huge when he passed from life fared aged forth for the first time now with his leaderlord the liegeman young was bidden to share the shock of battle neither softened his soul nor the sire’s bequest weakened in war   so the worm found out when once in fight the foes had met wiglaf spake  and his words were sage sad in spirit he said to his comrades “i remember the time when mead we took what promise we made to this prince of ours in the banquethall to our breakerofrings for gear of combat to give him requital for hardsword and helmet if hap should bring stress of this sort himself who chose us from all his army to aid him now urged us to glory and gave these treasures because he counted us keen with the spear and hardy ‘neath helm though this herowork our leader hoped unhelped and alone to finish for us  folkdefender who hath got him glory greater than all men for daring deeds now the day is come that our noble master has need of the might of warriors stout let us stride along the hero to help while the heat is about him glowing and grim for god is my witness i am far more fain the fire should seize along with my lord these limbs of mine unsuiting it seems our shields to bear homeward hence save here we essay to fell the foe and defend the life of the weders’ lord i wot ‘twere shame on the law of our land if alone the king out of geatish warriors woe endured and sank in the struggle my sword and helmet breastplate and board for us both shall serve” through slaughterreek strode he to succor his chieftain his battlehelm bore and brief words spake “beowulf dearest do all bravely as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise thy glory droop now great in deeds atheling steadfast with all thy strength shield thy life i will stand to help thee” at the words the worm came once again murderous monster mad with rage with firebillows flaming its foes to seek the hated men in heatwaves burned that board   to the boss and the breastplate failed to shelter at all the spearthane young yet quickly under his kinsman’s shield went eager the earl since his own was now all burned by the blaze the bold king again had mind of his glory with might his glaive was driven into the dragon’s head  blow nerved by hate but naegling   was shivered broken in battle was beowulf’s sword old and gray ‘twas granted him not that ever the edge of iron at all could help him at strife too strong was his hand so the tale is told and he tried too far with strength of stroke all swords he wielded though sturdy their steel they steaded him nought then for the third time thought on its feud that folkdestroyer firedread dragon and rushed on the hero where room allowed battlegrim burning its bitter teeth closed on his neck and covered him with waves of blood from his breast that welled ‘twas now men say in his sovran’s need that the earl made known his noble strain craft and keenness and courage enduring heedless of harm though his hand was burned hardyhearted he helped his kinsman a little lower the loathsome beast he smote with sword his steel drove in bright and burnished that blaze began to lose and lessen at last the king wielded his wits again warknife drew a biting blade by his breastplate hanging and the weders’helm smote that worm asunder felled the foe flung forth its life so had they killed it kinsmen both athelings twain thus an earl should be in danger’s day  of deeds of valor this conqueror’shour of the king was last of his work in the world the wound began which that dragonofearth had erst inflicted to swell and smart and soon he found in his breast was boiling baleful and deep pain of poison the prince walked on wise in his thought to the wall of rock then sat and stared at the structure of giants where arch of stone and steadfast column upheld forever that hall in earth yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless lave with water his winsome lord the king and conqueror covered with blood with struggle spent and unspan his helmet beowulf spake in spite of his hurt his mortal wound full well he knew his portion now was past and gone of earthly bliss and all had fled of his file of days and death was near “i would fain bestow on son of mine this gear of war were given me now that any heir should after me come of my proper blood this people i ruled fifty winters no folkking was there none at all of the neighboring clans who war would wage me with ‘warriors’friends’ and threat me with horrors at home i bided what fate might come and i cared for mine own feuds i sought not nor falsely swore ever on oath for all these things though fatally wounded fain am i from the rulerofman no wrath shall seize me when life from my frame must flee away for killing of kinsmen now quickly go and gaze on that hoard ‘neath the hoary rock wiglaf loved now the worm lies low sleeps heartsore of his spoil bereaved and fare in haste i would fain behold the gorgeous heirlooms golden store have joy in the jewels and gems lay down softlier for sight of this splendid hoard my life and the lordship i long have held” i have heard that swiftly the son of weohstan at wish and word of his wounded king  warsick warrior  woven mailcoat battlesark bore ‘neath the barrow’s roof then the clansman keen of conquest proud passing the seat   saw store of jewels and glistening gold the ground along by the wall were marvels and many a vessel in the den of the dragon the dawnflier old unburnished bowls of bygone men reft of richness rusty helms of the olden age and armrings many wondrously woven  such wealth of gold booty from barrow can burden with pride each human wight let him hide it who will  his glance too fell on a goldwove banner high o’er the hoard of handiwork noblest brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam all the earthfloor he easily saw and viewed all these vessels no vestige now was seen of the serpent the sword had ta’en him then i heard the hill of its hoard was reft old work of giants by one alone he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate at his own good will and the ensign took brightest of beacons  the blade of his lord  its edge was iron  had injured deep one that guarded the golden hoard many a year and its murderfire spread hot round the barrow in horrorbillows at midnight hour till it met its doom hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt highsouled hero if haply he’d find alive where he left him the lord of weders weakening fast by the wall of the cave so he carried the load his lord and king he found all bleeding famous chief at the lapse of life the liegeman again plashed him with water till point of word broke through the breasthoard beowulf spake sage and sad as he stared at the gold  “for the gold and treasure to god my thanks to the

hrones headland high uplifted that oceanwanderers oft may hail beowulf’s barrow as back from far they drive their keels o’er the darkling wave” from his neck he unclasped the collar of gold valorous king to his vassal gave it with brightgold helmet breastplate and ring to the youthful thane bade him use them in joy “thou art end and remnant of all our race the waegmunding name for wyrd hath swept them all my line to the land of doom earls in their glory i after them go” this word was the last which the wise old man harbored in heart ere hot deathwaves of balefire he chose from his bosom fled his soul to seek the saints’ reward it was heavy hap for that hero young on his lord beloved to look and find him lying on earth with life at end sorrowful sight but the slayer too awful earthdragon empty of breath lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure could the writhing monster rule it more for edges of iron had ended its days hard and battlesharp hammers’ leaving and that flierafar had fallen to ground hushed by its hurt its hoard all near no longer lusty aloft to whirl at midnight making its merriment seen proud of its prizes prone it sank by the handiwork of the heroking forsooth among folk but few achieve  though sturdy and strong as stories tell me and never so daring in deed of valor  the perilous breath of a poisonfoe to brave and to rush on the ringboard hall whenever his watch the warden keeps bold in the barrow beowulf paid the price of death for that precious hoard and each of the foes had found the end of this fleeting life befell erelong that the laggards in war the wood had left trothbreakers cowards ten together fearing before to flourish a spear in the sore distress of their sovran lord now in their shame their shields they carried armor of fight where the old man lay and they gazed on wiglaf wearied he sat at his sovran’s shoulder shieldsman good to wake him with water   nowise it availed though well he wished it in world no more could he barrier life for that leaderofbattles nor baffle the will of allwielding god doom of the lord was law o’er the deeds of every man as it is today grim was the answer easy to get from the youth for those that had yielded to fear wiglaf spake the son of weohstan  mournful he looked on those men unloved “who sooth will speak can say indeed that the ruler who gave you golden rings and the harness of war in which ye stand  for he at alebench oftentimes bestowed on hallfolk helm and breastplate lord to liegemen the likeliest gear which near of far he could find to give  threw away and wasted these weeds of battle on men who failed when the foemen came not at all could the king of his comradesinarms venture to vaunt though the victorywielder god gave him grace that he got revenge sole with his sword in stress and need to rescue his life ‘twas little that i could serve him in struggle yet shift i made hopeless it seemed to help my kinsman its strength ever waned when with weapon i struck that fatal foe and the fire less strongly flowed from its head  too few the heroes in throe of contest that thronged to our king now gift of treasure and girding of sword joy of the house and homedelight shall fail your folk his freeholdland every clansman within your kin shall lose and leave when lords highborn hear afar of that flight of yours a fameless deed yea death is better for liegemen all than a life of shame” that battletoil bade he at burg to announce at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow all the morning earls had sat daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain would they wail as dead or welcome home their lord beloved little   kept back of the tidings new but told them all the herald that up the headland rode  “now the willinggiver to weder folk in deathbed lies the lord of geats on the slaughterbed sleeps by the serpent’s deed and beside him is stretched that slayerofmen with knifewounds sick   no sword availed on the awesome thing in any wise to work a wound there wiglaf sitteth weohstan’s bairn by beowulf’s side the living earl by the other dead and heavy of heart a headwatch   keeps o’er friend and foe  now our folk may look for waging of war when once unhidden to frisian and frank the fall of the king is spread afar  the strife began when hot on the hugas   hygelac fell and fared with his fleet to the frisian land him there the hetwaras humbled in war plied with such prowess their power o’erwhelming that the boldinbattle bowed beneath it and fell in fight to his friends no wise could that earl give treasure and ever since the merowings’ favor has failed us wholly nor aught expect i of peace and faith from swedish folk ‘twas spread afar how ongentheow reft at ravenswood haethcyn hrethling of hope and life when the folk of geats for the first time sought in wanton pride the warlikescylfings soon the sage old sire   of ohtere ancient and awful gave answering blow the seaking   he slew and his spouse redeemed his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold mother of ohtere and onela then he followed his foes who fled before him sore beset and stole their way bereft of a ruler to ravenswood with his host he besieged there what swords had left the weary and wounded woes he threatened the whole night through to that hardpressed throng some with the morrow his sword should kill some should go to the gallowstree for rapture of ravens but rescue came with dawn of day for those desperate men when they heard the horn of hygelac sound tones of his trumpet the trusty king had followed their trail with faithful band the bloody swath of swedes and geats and the storm of their strife were seen afar how folk against folk the fight had wakened the ancient king with his atheling band sought his citadel sorrowing much ongentheow earl went up to his burg he had tested hygelac’s hardihood the proud one’s prowess would prove it no longer defied no more those fightingwanderers nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard his bairn and his bride so he bent him again old to his earthwalls yet after him came with slaughter for swedes the standards of hygelac o’er peaceful plains in pride advancing till hrethelings fought in the fenced town then ongentheow with edge of sword the hoarybearded was held at bay and the folkking there was forced to suffer eofor’s anger in ire at the king wulf wonreding with weapon struck and the chieftain’s blood for that blow in streams flowed ‘neath his hair no fear felt he stout old scylfing but straightway repaid in better bargain that bitter stroke and faced his foe with fell intent nor swift enough was the son of wonred answer to render the aged chief too soon on his head the helm was cloven bloodbedecked he bowed to earth and fell adown not doomed was he yet and well he waxed though the wound was sore then the hardy hygelacthane when his brother fell with broad brand smote giants’ sword crashing through giants’helm across the shieldwall sank the king his folk’s old herdsman fatally hurt there were many to bind the brother’s wounds and lift him fast as fate allowed his people to wield the placeofwar but eofor took from ongentheow earl from other the ironbreastplate hard sword hilted and helmet too and the hoarchief’s harness to hygelac carried who took the trappings and truly promised rich fee ‘mid folk  and fulfilled it so for that grim strife gave the geatish lord hrethel’s offspring when home he came to eofor and wulf a wealth of treasure each of them had a hundred thousand in land and linked rings nor at less price reckoned midearth men such mighty deeds and to eofor he gave his only daughter in pledge of grace the pride of his home “such is the feud the foeman’s rage deathhate of men so i deem it sure that the swedish folk will seek us home for this fall of their friends the fightingscylfings when once they learn that our warrior leader lifeless lies who land and hoard ever defended from all his foes furthered his folk’s weal finished his course a hardy hero  now haste is best that we go to gaze on our geatish lord and bear the bountiful breakerofrings to the funeral pyre no fragments merely shall burn with the warrior wealth of jewels gold untold and gained in terror treasure at last with his life obtained all of that booty the brands shall take fire shall eat it no earl must carry memorial jewel no maiden fair shall wreathe her neck with noble ring nay sad in spirit and shorn of her gold oft shall she pass o’er paths of exile now our lord all laughter has laid aside all mirth and revel many a spear morningcold shall be clasped amain lifted aloft nor shall lilt of harp those warriors wake but the wanhued raven fain o’er the fallen his feast shall praise and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate when he and the wolf were wasting the slain” so he told his sorrowful tidings and little   he lied the loyal man of word or of work the warriors rose sad they climbed to the cliffofeagles went welling with tears the wonder to view found on the sand there stretched at rest their lifeless lord who had lavished rings of old upon them endingday had dawned on the doughtyone death had seized in woful slaughter the weders’ king there saw they besides the strangest being loathsome lying their leader near prone on the field the fiery dragon fearful fiend with flame was scorched reckoned by feet it was fifty measures in length as it lay aloft erewhile it had revelled by night and anon come back seeking its den now in death’s sure clutch it had come to the end of its earthhall joys by it there stood the stoups and jars dishes lay there and deardecked swords eaten with rust as on earth’s lap resting a thousand winters they waited there for all that heritage huge that gold of bygone men was bound by a spell so the treasurehall could be touched by none of human kind  save that heaven’s king god himself might give whom he would helper of heroes the hoard to open  even such a man as seemed to him meet a perilous path it proved he   trod who heinously hid that hall within wealth under wall its watcher had killed one of a few   and the feud was avenged in woful fashion wondrous seems it what manner a man of might and valor oft ends his life when the earl no longer in meadhall may live with loving friends so beowulf when that barrow’s warden he sought and the struggle himself knew not in what wise he should wend from the world at last for   princes potent who placed the gold with a curse to doomsday covered it deep so that marked with sin the man should be hedged with horrors in hellbonds fast racked with plagues who should rob their hoard yet no greed for gold but the grace of heaven ever the king had kept in view wiglaf spake the son of weohstan “at the mandate of one oft warriors many sorrow must suffer and so must we the people’sshepherd showed not aught of care for our counsel king beloved that guardian of gold he should grapple not urged we but let him lie where he long had been in his earthhall waiting the end of the world the hest of heaven  this hoard is ours but grievously gotten too grim the fate which thither carried our king and lord i was within there and all i viewed the chambered treasure when chance allowed me and my path was made in no pleasant wise under the earthwall eager i seized such heap from the hoard as hands could bear and hurriedly carried it hither back to my liege and lord alive was he still still wielding his wits the wise old man spake much in his sorrow and sent you greetings and bade that ye build when he breathed no more on the place of his balefire a barrow high memorial mighty of men was he worthiest warrior wide earth o’er the while he had joy of his jewels and burg let us set out in haste now the second time to see and search this store of treasure these wallhid wonders  the way i show you  where gathered near ye may gaze your fill at broadgold and rings let the bier soon made be all in order when out we come our king and captain to carry thither  man beloved  where long he shall bide safe in the shelter of sovran god” then the bairn of weohstan bade command hardy chief to heroes many that owned their homesteads hither to bring firewood from far  o’er the folk they ruled  for the famedone’s funeral “ fire shall devour and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior who oft stood stout in the ironshower when sped from the string a storm of arrows shot o’er the shieldwall the shaft held firm featly feathered followed the barb” and now the sage young son of weohstan seven chose of the chieftain’s thanes the best he found that band within and went with these warriors one of eight under hostile roof in hand one bore a lighted torch and led the way no lots they cast for keeping the hoard when once the warriors saw it in hall altogether without a guardian lying there lost and little they mourned when they had hastily haled it out dearbought treasure the dragon they cast the worm o’er the wall for the wave to take and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems then the woven gold on a wain was laden  countless quite  and the king was borne hoary hero to hronesness then fashioned for him the folk of geats firm on the earth a funeralpile and hung it with helmets and harness of war and breastplates bright as the boon he asked and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain heroes mourning their master dear then on the hill that hugest of balefires the warriors wakened woodsmoke rose black over blaze and blent was the roar of flame with weeping the wind was still till the fire had broken the frame of bones hot at the heart in heavy mood their misery moaned they their master’s death wailing her woe the widow   old her hair upbound for beowulf’s death sung in her sorrow and said full oft she dreaded the doleful days to come deaths enow and doom of battle and shame  the smoke by the sky was devoured the folk of the weders fashioned there on the headland a barrow broad and high by oceanfarers far descried in ten days’ time their toil had raised it the battlebrave’s beacon round brands of the pyre a wall they built the worthiest ever that wit could prompt in their wisest men they placed in the barrow that precious booty the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile hardy heroes from hoard in cave  trusting the ground with treasure of earls gold in the earth where ever it lies useless to men as of yore it was then about that barrow the battlekeen rode athelingborn a band of twelve lament to make to mourn their king chant their dirge and their chieftain honor they praised his earlship his acts of prowess worthily witnessed and well it is that men their masterfriend mightily laud heartily love when hence he goes from life in the body forlorn away thus made their

 here bounds the gaudy gilded chair bedecked with fringe and tassels gay the melancholy mourner there pursues her sad and painful way  here guarded by a motley train the pampered countess glares along there wrung by poverty and pain pale misery mingles with the throng  here as the blazoned chariot rolls and prancing horses scare the crowd great names adorning little souls announce the empty vain and proud  here four tall lackeys slow precede a painted dame in rich array there the sad shivering child of need steals barefoot o’er the flinty way  ‘room room stand back’ they loudly cry the wretched poor are driven around on every side they scattered fly and shrink before the threatening sound  here amidst jewels feathers flowers the senseless duchess sits demure heedless of all the anxious hours the sons of modest worth endure  all silvered and embroidered o’er she neither knows nor pities pain the beggar freezing at her door she overlooks with nice disdain  the wretch whom poverty subdues scarce dares to raise his tearful eye or if by chance the throng he views his loudest murmur is a sigh  the poor wan mother at whose breast the pining infant craves relief in one thin tattered garment dressed creeps forth to pour the plaint of grief  but ah how little heeded here the faltering tongue reveals its woe for highborn fools with frown austere condemn the pangs they never know  ‘take physic pomp’ let reason say ‘what can avail thy trappings rare the tomb shall close thy glittering day the beggar prove thy equal there’

 impatient as we were for all of them to join us the land had not yet risen into view gulls had swept the gray steel towers away so that it profited less to go searching away over the humming earth than to stay in immediate relation to these other thingsboxes store parts whatever you wanted to call them whose installedness was the price of further revolutions so you knew this combat was the last and still the relationship waxed billowed like scenery on the breeze  they are the same aren’t they the presumed landscape and the dream of home because the people are all homesick today or desperately sleeping trying to remember how those rectangular shapes became so extraneous and so near to create a foreground of quiet knowledge in which youth had grown old chanting and singing wise hymns that will sign for old age and so lift up the past to be persuaded and be put down again  the warning is nothing more than an aspirate “h” the problem is sketched completely like fireworks mounted on poles complexion of evening the accurate voices of the others during cocacola lessons it becomes patent of noise on the left and we had so skipped a stage that the great wave of the past compounded in derision submerged idea and nondreamer alike in falsetto starlight like “purity” of design that had been the first danger sign to wash the sticky icky stuff down the drainpfui  how does it feel to be outside and inside at the same time the delicious feeling of the air contradicting and secretly abetting the interior warmth but the land curdles the dismay in which it’s written bearing to a final point of folly and doom the wisdom of these generations look at what you’ve done to the landscape the ice cube the olive there is a perfect tricity mesh of things extending all the way along the river on both sides with the end left for thoughts on construction that are always turning to alps and thresholds above the tide of others feeding a european moss rose without glory  we shall very soon have the pleasure of recording a period of unanimous tergiversation in this respect and to make that pleasure the greater it is worth while at the risk of tedious iteration to put first upon record a final protest rather decaying art genius inspiration to hold to an impossible “calque” of reality than “the new school of the trivial rising up on the field of battle something of sludge and leafmold” and life goes trickling out through the holes like water through a sieve all in one direction  you who were directionless and thought it would solve everything if you found one what do you make of this just because a thing is immortal is that any reason to worship it death after all is immortal but you have gone into your houses and shut the doors meaning there can be no further discussion and the river pursues its lonely course with the sky and the trees cast up from the landscape for green brings unhappinessle vert porte malheur “the chartreuse mountain on the absinthe plain makes the strong man’s tears tumble down like rain”  all this came to pass eons ago your program worked out perfectly you even avoided the monotony of perfection by leaving in certain flaws a backward way of becoming a forced handshake an absentminded smile though in fact nothing was left to chance each detail was startlingly clear as though seen through a magnifying glass or would have been to an ideal observer namely yourself for only you could watch yourself so patiently from afar the way god watches a sinner on the path to redemption sometimes disappearing into valleys but always on the way for it all builds up into something meaningless or meaningful as architecture because planned and then abandoned when completed to live afterwards in sunlight and shadow a certain amount of years who cares about what was there before there is no going back for standing still means death and life is moving on moving on towards death but sometimes standing still is also life

sunbeams cross and recross till they weave a spiderweb meshes of fire some great fish breaks at times and talks to his own self howeer he please touching that other whom his dam called god because to talk about him vexesha could he but know and time to vex is now when talk is safer than in wintertime moreover prosper and miranda sleep in confidence he drudges at their task and it is good to cheat

stars came otherwise only made clouds winds meteors such as that also this isle what lives and grows thereon and snaky sea which rounds and ends the same  thinketh it came of being ill at ease he hated that he cannot change his cold nor cure its ache hath spied an icy fish that longed to scape the rockstream where she lived and thaw herself within the lukewarm brine o the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid a crystal spike twixt two warm walls of wave only she ever sickened found repulse at the other kind of water not her life greendense and dimdelicious bred o the sun flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe and in her old bounds buried her despair hating and loving warmth alike so he  thinketh he made thereat the sun this isle trees and the fowls here beast and creeping thing yon otter sleekwet black lithe as a leech yon auk one fireeye in a ball of foam that floats and feeds a certain badger brown he hath watched hunt with that slant whitewedge eye by moonlight and the pie with the long tongue that pricks deep into oak warts for a worm and says a plain word when she finds her prize but will not eat the ants the ants themselves that build a wall of seeds and settled stalks about their holehe made all these and more made all we see and us in spite how else he could not himself make a second self to be his mate as well have made himself he would not make what he mislikes or slights an eyesore to him or not worth his pains but did in envy listlessness or sport make what himself would fain in a manner be weaker in most points stronger in a few worthy and yet mere playthings all the while things he admires and mocks toothat is it because so brave so better though they be it nothing skills if he begin to plague look now i melt a gourdfruit into mash

that make the merry din saucy through their veined wings and mind me not in which feat if his leg snapped brittle clay and he lay stupidlikewhy i should laugh and if he spying me should fall to weep beseech me to be good repair his wrong bid his poor leg smart less or grow again well as the chance were this might take or else not take my fancy i might hear his cry and give the mankin three sound legs for one or pluck the other off leave him like an egg and lessoned he was mine and merely clay were this no pleasure lying in the thyme drinking the mash with brain become alive making and marring clay at will so he  thinketh such shows nor right nor wrong in him nor kind nor cruel he is strong and lord am strong myself compared to yonder crabs that march now from the mountain to the sea let twenty pass and stone the twentyfirst loving not hating not just choosing so say the first straggler that boasts purple spots shall join the file one pincer twisted off say this bruised fellow shall

 i called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder the last time it appeared ramming me with its ivory head cracking my back to relieve me of worry and hope i called the white donkey surprised at the sound of my voice scared i wondered if the white head would give me its donkey brain snowy matter dripping into my ears like the horse of the first man who fell off the donkey teaching me about desire and the moan that white hair on the back of my head that warns me  i called the donkey it came slowly toward me huge ears shaking with fury its breath turning the air white as it bit into the white apple of my throat i faced the donkey watched its gait become a shuffle of possession shaking its head as it stopped to root its dirty hoofs in the ground  i stepped back and clicked my fingers but it would not come closer its snort commanding i listen as it farted i walked away and did not know it was i who yearned for labor of the ass because the animal i summoned couldn’t remove the white scar from my heart a blind life i lived for good

lingering now languishes in a cavernous underground source fountain for none  music of exhaust and darkening horizons her hair begins to thin nails soften while she waits a siren of light slow to diminish wasting rescue dogs at night are frequent the scales that once cleaved to her flesh her skin house shelter now a dayglow phosphorescence luminous filth cleavage radiating and filtered through her boils begin to grow round lumps spurting evanescence a rainbow of industry inviting those who come to visit to enjoy her paints corporeal images of what might be a river now sewer then tomb

 right now a dog tied up in the street is barking with the grief of being left a dog bereft right now a car is parking  the dog emits petals of a barking flower and barking flakes of snow that float upward from the street below to where another victim sits  who listens to the whole city and the dog honking like a car alarm and doesn’t mean the dog any harm and doesn’t feel any pity

 we had to sleep in the streets not on the sidewalks in the streets  cause the sidewalks was full of urine and body waste dead bodies  and we had to sleep out there in the hell of waste and the dead bodies  i walked from water up to my neck to get to the convention center  there was dead dogs dead rodents you had to push all that kind of mess out of the way  hoping that it didn’t touch you i was pushing them out the way  so many dead bodies coming from the ninth ward up our way and they had people that was drowned up my way  now this convention center wasn’t nothing nice i kid you not  people still crying and begging to go home there’s nothing there  you have no running water you have no lights the place stinks it’s contaminated  i’ve been there twice i died there i died  me my tenyearold daughter my sister and her thirtytwoyearold son  we lived out there seven days five days we had no food no water  every night and every day the military people was throwing down on us  like we was a bunch of wild animals they was on a hunt to kill  they killed one guy right there in front of us run over him with a police car  and then they shot the man and left him there they didn’t cover him up or nothing  and the next day it was so hot out there  when they did come to pick him up his body was stuck to the ground  so i can understand you want to keep control of the people  but why have those people draw guns on children women with babies in their stomachs  every time you look around we breaking and running trying to get into the convention center  and they’re drawing guns on people like that i mean it don’t make no kinda sense  they wouldn’t let you leave you had to stay there  cause we smelled like  i’m serious  because everybody was smelling the same way   smelling like sewer like shit piss that was the scariest time of my life  and we had to have that on us because we ain’t had no water we ain’t had no sewer  there wasn’t no limit on it because you had to scrub yourself just to get the scent out of your skin  because like i said they knew they have a lot of poor people like myself don’t have no transportation  don’t have no money well i have a car but it got under the water  me my tenyearold daughter my sister and her thirtytwo yearold son we lived out there seven days  we looked for her for an hour and thirty minutes in the convention center  five days we had no food no water i seen children die i seen old people die  i seen murders i seen rapes i seen people murder people then cut their heads off  we already knew that the killer people were putting them in the icebox  killing little children and raping little children the men the looters the people that was staying in there  i am telling you that was the most horriblest experience i have ever seen in my life  i seen the troops shoot people they ride around with guns almost like we was in a prison camp  no the place wasn’t on fire it was some children upstairs playing with the fire extinguisher  like hell and like i said i never in my life grew up in a house with millions of people  you know i’ve always had my own room my own you know my own i was always  just   in the convention center the buses came in every night every day they was telling us  “the buses is coming the buses is coming” the buses passed right there in front of us and kept going  the people was there to see the buses so everybody run rushing the buses to get on the damn buses and get out of there  every day they was moving us around go here go there the buses is gonna meet you here meet you there  they was lying there was never no buses they was lying they was just making us tired they had us in there to kill us  we used to look up at the bridge and see all the buses going that way to the superdome  or to the hospital or to the people in those condos getting them all out of there and going back  buses going back again buses leaving out new orleans again that’s how it was  it was nopd police but it wasn’t our regular district police  these were special nopd policemen we was running from place to place telling them  “oh this person dead that person dead” they said “well we can’t do nothing about no dead bodies  y’all just don’t worry y’all just try to get the fuck out of here”  they say “y’all go to the bridge the bus’s going to pick you up on the bridge”  i think it was they job to send the national guards and the armored people in there  to make sure everybody was evacuated they left us out there for five six seven days  we stayed on the bridge nine hours they didn’t care about us  the first thing they dropped into us was boxes of cigarettes not food not water boxes of cigarettes  two hours later they drop us water and half of it burst open cause they was so high up when they dropped it  two hours after that they drop us some army food in a box we got to pour water in to heat up  we was hungry we had no other choice  the news got us out not the national guard not the mayor not blanco the news people is the only ones who got us out  channel 26 got me out channel 26 the rest of them was there to kill us  i got tired of convention centers i wanted to come the hell up out of that damn

 all year death after death after death then today look how majestically clouds float in the sky god putting on a show of tenderness nothing like thoughts that rise and drift in my mind like flakes shaken in a snow globe and my brain laboring in its own night never feeling the punky starlight of dark thirty the time a friend said for us to meet and had to explain it was half an hour after the first dark when daylilies fold up and headlights lead the way home but maybe too early to find the moon turning half its body away holding it hidden like the black side of a mirror unseen until it breaks unexpectedly the way grief breaks over you when youve already given all youve got and hands you tools you dont know how to use  the blush of dark thirty turned bleak when i heard about the o o dark thirty military time for 1230 am hour of the deepest dark when if im awake as i often am a storm of thoughts battle one another now settling unsettlingly on the ways we make war and flaunt it take the civil war double cannon the lawn of a city hall in the deep south twinned so that two cannonballs chained together kill two at a time often decapitating and why did a small town population 932 in rural new hampshire import a ballistic missile to crown its village green  brechts line floats up pity the nation that needs heroes but what to do with the guy pontificating on the middle east telling me with the gravest authority that of stupiditythe reason for the strife there hatred is in the rocks

 suppose it is nothing but the hive that there are drones and workers and queens and nothing but storing honey  material things as well as culture and wisdom  for the next generation this generation never living except as it swarms in the sunlight of youth strengthening its wings on what has been gathered and tasting on the way to the hive from the clover field the delicate spoil suppose all this and suppose the truth that the nature of man is greater than natures need in the hive and you must bear the burden of life as well as the urge from your spirits excess  well i say to live it out like a god sure of immortal life though you are in doubt is the way to live it if that doesnt make god proud of you then god is nothing but gravitation or sleep is the golden goal

 these hearts were woven of human joys and cares washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth the years had given them kindness dawn was theirs and sunset and the colours of the earth these had seen movement and heard music known slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone touched flowers and furs and cheeks all this is ended  there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter and lit by the rich skies all day and after frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance and wandering loveliness he leaves a white unbroken glory a gathered radiance a width a shining peace under the night

 baton rouge 1940 these are savannas bluer than your dreams where other loves are fashioned to older music and the romantic in his light boat puts out among flamingos and water moccasins looking for the river that went by last year  even the angels wear confederate uniforms and when the magnolia blooms and the honeysuckle golden lovers brighter than the moon read catullus in the flaring light of the burning negro in the open eye of midnight  and the traveller moving in the hot swamps where every human sympathy sends up the temperature comes of a sudden on the hidden glacier whose motives are blonder than hitler’s choir boys  here is the ambiguous tenderness of ’gators trumpeting their loves along a hundred miles of rivers writhing under trees like myths and human existence pursues the last the simple and desperate life of the senses since love survives only as ironic legend response to situations no longer present men lacking dignity are seized by pride which is the easy upperclass infection  the masters are at home in this merciless climate but deep in the caves of their minds some animal memory warns of the fate of the mammoth at the end of the iceage as sleeping children a toy they hug the last fatal error but their eyes are awake and their dreams shake as with palsy  over birmingham where the blast furnace flowers and beyond the piney woods in cotton country continually puzzling the pale aristocrats the sun burns equally white man and black  the labor which they do makes more and more their brotherhood condition for their whole existence they mint their own light and their fusing fires will melt at last these centuries of ice  this is a nightmare nimble in the big house where sleepers are wakeful cuddling their terror in the empty acres of their rich beds dreaming of bones in museums where the black boys yawn

 sweet auburn loveliest village of the plain where health and plenty cheared the labouring swain where smiling spring its earliest visit paid and parting summers lingering blooms delayed dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease seats of my youth when every sport could please how often have i loitered oer thy green where humble happiness endeared each scene how often have i paused on every charm the sheltered cot the cultivated farm the neverfailing brook the busy mill the decent church that topt the neighbouring hill the hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade for talking age and whispering lovers made how often have i blest the coming day when toil remitting lent its turn to play and all the village train from labour free led up their sports beneath the spreading tree while many a pastime circled in the shade the young contending as the old surveyed and many a gambol frolicked oer the ground and slights of art and feats of strength went round and still as each repeated pleasure tired succeeding sports the mirthful band inspired the dancing pair that simply sought renown by holding out to tire each other down the swain mistrustless of his smutted face while secret laughter tittered round the place the bashful virgins sidelong looks of love the matrons glance that would those looks reprove these were thy charms sweet village sports like these with sweet succession taught even toil to please these round thy bowers their chearful influence shed these were thy charmsbut all these charms are fled sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn amidst thy bowers the tyrants hand is seen and desolation saddens all thy green one only master grasps the whole domain and half a tillage stints thy smiling plain no more thy glassy brook reflects the day but choaked with sedges works its weedy way along thy glades a solitary guest the hollowsounding bittern guards its nest amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies and tires their echoes with unvaried cries sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all and the long grass oertops the mouldering wall and trembling shrinking from the spoilers hand far far away thy children leave the land ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey where wealth accumulates and men decay princes and lords may flourish or may fade a breath can make them as a breath has made but a bold peasantry their countrys pride when once destroyed can never be supplied a time there was ere englands griefs began when every rood of ground maintained its man for him light labour spread her wholesome store just gave what life required but gave no more his best companions innocence and health and his best riches ignorance of wealth but times are altered trades unfeeling train usurp the land and dispossess the swain along the lawn where scattered hamlets rose unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose and every want to oppulence allied and every pang that folly pays to pride those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom those calm desires that asked but little room those healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene lived in each look and brightened all the green these far departing seek a kinder shore and rural mirth and manners are no more sweet auburn parent of the blissful hour thy glades forlorn confess the tyrants power here as i take my solitary rounds amidst thy tangling walks and ruined grounds and many a year elapsed return to view where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew remembrance wakes with all her busy train swells at my breast and turns the past to pain in all my wanderings round this world of care in all my griefsand god has given my share i still had hopes my latest hours to crown amidst these humble bowers to lay me down to husband out lifes taper at the close and keep the flame from wasting by repose i still had hopes for pride attends us still amidst the swains to shew my booklearned skill around my fire an evening groupe to draw and tell of all i felt and all i saw and as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue pants to the place from whence at first she flew i still had hopes my long vexations past here to returnand die at home at last o blest retirement friend to lifes decline retreats from care that never must be mine how happy he who crowns in shades like these a youth of labour with an age of ease who quits a world where strong temptations try and since tis hard to combat learns to fly for him no wretches born to work and weep explore the mine or tempt the dangerous deep no surly porter stands in guilty state to spurn imploring famine from the gate but on he moves to meet his latter end angels around befriending virtues friend bends to the grave with unperceived decay while resignation gently slopes the way and all his prospects brightening to the last his heaven commences ere the world be past sweet was the sound when oft at evenings close up yonder hill the village murmur rose there as i past with careless steps and slow the mingling notes came softend from below the swain responsive as the milkmaid sung the sober herd that lowed to meet their young the noisy geese that gabbled oer the pool the playful children just let loose from school the watchdogs voice that bayed the whispering wind and the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind these all in sweet confusion sought the shade and filled each pause the nightingale had made but now the sounds of population fail no cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale no busy steps the grassgrown footway tread for all the bloomy flush of life is fled all but yon widowed solitary thing that feebly bends beside the plashy spring she wretched matron forced in age for bread to strip the brook with mantling cresses spread to pick her wintry faggot from the thorn to seek her nightly shed and weep till morn she only left of all the harmless train the sad historian of the pensive plain near yonder copse where once the garden smiled and still where many a gardenflower grows wild there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose the village preachers modest mansion rose a man he was to all the country dear and passing rich with forty pounds a year remote from towns he ran his godly race nor eer had changed nor wished to change his place unpractised he to fawn or seek for power by doctrines fashioned to the varying hour far other aims his heart had learned to prize more skilled to raise the wretched than to rise his house was known to all the vagrant train he chid their wanderings but relieved their pain the longremembered beggar was his guest whose beard descending swept his aged breast the ruined spendthrift now no longer proud claimd kindred there and had his claims allowed the broken soldier kindly bade to stay sate by his fire and talked the night away wept oer his wounds or tales of sorrow done shouldered his crutch and shewed how fields were won pleased with his guests the good man learned to glow and quite forgot their vices in their woe careless their merits or their faults to scan his pity gave ere charity began thus to relieve the wretched was his pride and even his failings leaned to virtues side but in his duty prompt at every call he watched and wept he prayed and felt for all and as a bird each fond endearment tries to tempt its newfledged offspring to the skies he tried each art reproved each dull delay allured to brighter worlds and led the way beside the bed where parting life was layed and sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismayed the reverend champion stood at his control despair and anguish fled the struggling soul comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise and his last faltering accents whispered praise at church with meek and unaffected grace his looks adorned the venerable place truth from his lips prevailed with double sway and fools who came to scoff remained to pray the service past around the pious man with steady zeal each honest rustic ran even children followed with endearing wile and plucked his gown to share the good mans smile his ready smile a parents warmth exprest their welfare pleased him and their cares distrest to them his heart his love his griefs were given but all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven as some tall cliff that lifts its awful form swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm tho round its breast the rolling clouds are spread eternal sunshine settles on its head beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way with blossomed furze unprofitably gay there in his noisy mansion skilld to rule the village master taught his little school a man severe he was and stern to view i knew him well and every truant knew well had the boding tremblers learned to trace the days disasters in his morning face full well they laughed with counterfeited glee at all his jokes for many a joke had he full well the busy whisper circling round conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned yet he was kind or if severe in aught the love he bore to learning was in fault the village all declared how much he knew twas certain he could write and cypher too lands he could measure terms and tides presage and evn the story ran that he could gauge in arguing too the parson owned his skill for even tho vanquished he could argue still while words of learned length and thundering sound amazed the gazing rustics ranged around and still they gazed and still the wonder grew that one small head could carry all he knew but past is all his fame the very spot where many a time he triumphed is forgot near yonder thorn that lifts its head on high where once the signpost caught the passing eye low lies that house where nutbrown draughts inspired where greybeard mirth and smiling toil retired where village statesmen talked with looks profound and news much older than their ale went round imagination fondly stoops to trace the parlour splendours of that festive place the whitewashed wall the nicely sanded floor the varnished clock that clicked behind the door the chest contrived a double debt to pay a bed by night a chest of drawers by day the pictures placed for ornament and use the twelve good rules the royal game of goose the hearth except when winter chilld the day with aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay while broken teacups wisely kept for shew ranged oer the chimney glistened in a row vain transitory splendours could not all reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall obscure it sinks nor shall it more impart an hours importance to the poor mans heart thither no more the peasant shall repair to sweet oblivion of his daily care no more the farmers news the barbers tale no more the woodmans ballad shall prevail no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear relax his ponderous strength and lean to hear the host himself no longer shall be found careful to see the mantling bliss go round nor the coy maid half willing to be prest shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest yes let the rich deride the proud disdain these simple blessings of the lowly train to me more dear congenial to my heart one native charm than all the gloss of art spontaneous joys where nature has its play the soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway lightly they frolic oer the vacant mind unenvied unmolested unconfined but the long pomp the midnight masquerade with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed in these ere triflers half their wish obtain the toiling pleasure sickens into pain and even while fashions brightest arts decoy the heart distrusting asks if this be joy ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey the rich mans joys encrease the poors decay tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand between a splendid and a happy land proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore and shouting folly hails them from her shore hoards even beyond the misers wish abound and rich men flock from all the world around yet count our gains this wealth is but a name that leaves our useful products still the same not so the loss the man of wealth and pride takes up a space that many poor supplied space for his lake his parks extended bounds space for his horses equipage and hounds the robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth has robbed the neighbouring fields of half their growth his seat where solitary sports are seen indignant spurns the cottage from the green around the world each needful product flies for all the luxuries the world supplies while thus the land adorned for pleasure all in barren splendour feebly waits the fall as some fair female unadorned and plain secure to please while youth confirms her reign slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes but when those charms are past for charms are frail when time advances and when lovers fail she then shines forth solicitous to bless in all the glaring impotence of dress thus fares the land by luxury betrayed in natures simplest charms at first arrayed but verging to decline its splendours rise its vistas strike its palaces surprize while scourged by famine from the smiling land the mournful peasant leads his humble band and while he sinks without one arm to save the country bloomsa garden and a grave where then ah where shall poverty reside to scape the pressure of contiguous pride if to some commons fenceless limits strayed he drives his flock to pick the scanty blade those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide and evn the bareworn common is denied if to the city spedwhat waits him there to see profusion that he must not share to see ten thousand baneful arts combined to pamper luxury and thin mankind to see those joys the sons of pleasure know extorted from his fellowcreatures woe here while the courtier glitters in brocade there the pale artist plies the sickly trade here while the proud their longdrawn pomps display there the black gibbet glooms beside the way the dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign here richly deckt admits the gorgeous train tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square the rattling chariots clash the torches glare sure scenes like these no troubles eer annoy sure these denote one universal joy are these thy serious thoughtsah turn thine eyes where the poor houseless shivering female lies she once perhaps in village plenty blest has wept at tales of innocence distrest her modest looks the cottage might adorn sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn now lost to all her friends her virtue fled near her betrayers door she lays her head and pinchd with cold and shrinking from the shower with heavy heart deplores that luckless hour when idly first ambitious of the town she left her wheel and robes of country brown do thine sweet auburn thine the loveliest train do thy fair tribes participate her pain even now perhaps by cold and hunger led at proud mens doors they ask a little bread ah no to distant climes a dreary scene where half the convex world intrudes between through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go where wild altama murmurs to their woe far different there from all that charmd before the various terrors of that horrid shore those blazing suns that dart a downward ray and fiercely shed intolerable day those matted woods where birds forget to sing but silent bats in drowsy clusters cling those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned where the dark scorpion gathers death around where at each step the stranger fears to wake the rattling terrors of the vengeful snake where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey and savage men more murderous still than they while oft in whirls the mad tornado flies mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies far different these from every former scene the cooling brook the grassy vested green the breezy covert of the warbling grove that only shelterd thefts of harmless love good heaven what sorrows gloomd that parting day that called them from their native walks away when the poor exiles every pleasure past hung round their bowers and fondly looked their last and took a long farewell and wished in vain for seats like these beyond the western main and shuddering still to face the distant deep returned and wept and still returned to weep the good old sire the first prepared to go to new found worlds and wept for others woe but for himself in conscious virtue brave he only wished for worlds beyond the grave his lovely daughter lovelier in her tears the fond companion of his helpless years silent went next neglectful of her charms and left a lovers for a fathers arms with louder plaints the mother spoke her woes and blessed the cot where every pleasure rose and kist her thoughtless babes with many a tear and claspt them close in sorrow doubly dear whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief in all the silent manliness of grief o luxury thou curst by heavens decree how ill exchanged are things like these for thee how do thy potions with insidious joy diffuse their pleasures only to destroy kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown boast of a florid vigour not their own at every draught more large and large they grow a bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe till sapped their strength and every part unsound down down they sink and spread a ruin round even now the devastation is begun and half the business of destruction done even now methinks as pondering here i stand i see the rural virtues leave the land down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail that idly waiting flaps with every gale downward they move a melancholy band pass from the shore and darken all the strand contented toil and hospitable care and kind connubial tenderness are there and piety with wishes placed above and steady loyalty and faithful love and thou sweet poetry thou loveliest maid still first to fly where sensual joys invade unfit in these degenerate times of shame to catch the heart or strike for honest fame dear charming nymph neglected and decried my shame in crowds my solitary pride thou source of all my bliss and all my woe that foundst me poor at first and keepst me so thou guide by which the nobler arts excell thou nurse of every virtue fare thee well farewell and o whereer thy voice be tried on tornos cliffs or pambamarcas side whether were equinoctial fervours glow or winter wraps the polar world in snow still let thy voice prevailing over time redress the rigours of the inclement clime aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain teach him that states of native strength possest tho very poor may still be very blest that trades proud empire hastes to swift decay as ocean sweeps the labourd mole away while selfdependent power can time defy as rocks resist the billows and the sky

 for six nights now the cries have sounded in the pasture coyote voices fluting across the greening rise to the east where the deer have almost ceased to pass now that the developers have carved up yet another section filled another space with spars and studs concrete runoff  five years ago you saw two spotted fawns rise for the first time from brome where brick mailboxes will stand only three years past came great horned owls who raised two squeaking downy owlets that perished in the traffic skimming too low across the road behind some swift more fortunate cottontail  it was on an august afternoon that you drove in curling down our long gravel drive past pasture and creek that you saw flickering at the edge of your sight three mounted indians motionless in the paused breeze who vanished when you turned your head  we have felt the presence on this land of others of some who paused here some who passed who have left in the thick clay shards and splinters of themselves that we dig up turn up with spade and tine when we garden or bury our animals their voices whisper on moonless nights in the back pasture hollow where the horses snort and nicker wary with alarm

 they took my body to the forest they asked me to climb a ladder  i did not want to climb a ladder but they forced me to climb the ladder  if you don’t climb the ladder we will bury you in the foamy mud  i had to decide should i die by hanging or by burial  i climbed the ladder and they wrapped a belt around the thick limb of a tree  and then when i could no longer breathe they tossed me into a stream  and i floated to the edge of the village where someone prayed for my soul  it’s like this in a lullaby for the end of the world  the options for the end are endless  but this is not really a lullaby for the end of the world  it’s about the beginning what happens when we start to rot  in the daylight the way the light shines on  the ants and worms and parasites mauling our bodies  it’s about the swarms of dogs gnawing our skin and bones  do you know what it’s like when a ghost licks your intestines  do you know what it’s like when a rat devours your brain  to avoid the hole the children must sing sweetly softly  to avoid the hole they must fill their songs with love

 when the fire bell rang its two short one long electric signal the boys closest to the wall of windows had to raise the blinds and close the sashes and then join the last of our line as it snaked out the classroom onto the field of asphalt where we stood gradebygrade until the principal appeared with her gold timex  we learned early that catastrophe must always be attended in silence that death prefers us orderly and ordered and that rules will save us from the chaos of our fear so that even if we die we die together which was the calm almost consoling thought i had each time the yellow cd siren wailed and we would tuck ourselves beneath our sturdy desktops  eyes averted from the windows we’d wait for the drill to pass or until the nun’s rosary no longer clicked and we could hear her struggling to free herself from the legwell of her desk and then her call for us to rise and like herself brush off the dust gathered on our clothes and then the lessons resumed no thought of how easily we interred ourselves  though at home each would dream the mushroom cloud the white cap of apocalypse whose funnel stem sucked glass from windows air from lungs and made all these rehearsals the sad and hollow gestures that they were for we knew it in our bones that we would die curled in a last defense head on knees arms locked around legs the way i’ve seen it since in nursing homes  and hospices forms bedsheets can’t hide as if in death the body takes on the soul’s compact shape acrobatic posed to tumble free of the desktop or bed and join the expanse and wide scatter of debris

 as i was going down impassive rivers i no longer felt myself guided by haulers yelping redskins had taken them as targets and had nailed them naked to colored stakes  i was indifferent to all crews the bearer of flemish wheat or english cottons when with my haulers this uproar stopped the rivers let me go where i wanted  into the furious lashing of the tides more heedless than childrens brains the other winter i ran and loosened peninsulas have not undergone a more triumphant hubbub  the storm blessed my sea vigils lighter than a cork i danced on the waves that are called eternal rollers of victims ten nights without missing the stupid eye of the lighthouses  sweeter than the flesh of hard apples is to children the green water penetrated my hull of fir and washed me of spots of blue wine and vomit scattering rudder and grapplinghook  and from then on i bathed in the poem of the sea infused with stars and lactescent devouring the azure verses where like a pale elated piece of flotsam a pensive drowned figure sometimes sinks  where suddenly dyeing the blueness delirium and slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight stronger than alcohol vaster than our lyres the bitter redness of love ferments  i know the skies bursting with lightning and the waterspouts and the surf and the currents i know the evening and dawn as exalted as a flock of doves and at times i have seen what man thought he saw  i have seen the low sun spotted with mystic horrors lighting up with long violet clots resembling actors of very ancient dramas the waves rolling far off their quivering of shutters  i have dreamed of the green night with dazzled snows a kiss slowly rising to the eyes of the sea the circulation of unknown saps and the yellow and blue awakening of singing phosphorous  i followed during pregnant months the swell like hysterical cows in its assault on the reefs without dreaming that the luminous feet of the marys could constrain the snout of the wheezing oceans  i struck against you know unbelievable floridas mingling with flowers panthers eyes and human skin rainbows stretched like bridal reins under the horizon of the seas to greenish herds  i have seen enormous swamps ferment fishtraps where a whole leviathan rots in the rushes avalanches of water in the midst of a calm and the distances cataracting toward the abyss  glaciers suns of silver nacreous waves skies of embers hideous strands at the end of brown gulfs where giant serpents devoured by bedbugs fall down from gnarled trees with black scent  i should have liked to show children those sunfish of the blue wave the fish of gold the singing fish foam of flowers rocked my drifting and ineffable winds winged me at times  at times a martyr weary of poles and zones the sea whose sob created my gentle roll brought up to me her dark flowers with yellow suckers and i remained like a woman on her knees  resembling an island tossing on my sides the quarrels and droppings of noisy birds with yellow eyes and i sailed on when through my fragile ropes drowned men sank backward to sleep  now i a boat lost in the foliage of caves thrown by the storm into the birdless air i whose waterdrunk carcass would not have been rescued by the monitors and the hanseatic sailboats  free smoking topped with violet fog i who pierced the reddening sky like a wall bearing delicious jam for good poets lichens of sunlight and mucus of azure  who ran spotted with small electric moons a wild plank escorted by black seahorses when julys beat down with blows of cudgels the ultramarine skies with burning funnels  i who trembled hearing at fifty leagues off the moaning of the behemoths in heat and the thick maelstroms eternal spinner of the blue immobility i miss europe with its ancient parapets  i have seen sidereal archipelagos and islands whose delirious skies are open to the seawanderer is it in these bottomless nights that you sleep and exile yourself million golden birds o future vigor –  but in truth i have wept too much dawns are heartbreaking every moon is atrocious and every sun bitter acrid love has swollen me with intoxicating torpor o let my keel burst o let me go into the sea  if i want a water of europe it is the black cold puddle where in the sweetsmelling twilight a squatting child full of sadness releases a boat as fragile as a may butterfly  no longer can i bathed in your languor o waves follow in the wake of the cotton boats nor cross through the pride of flags and flames nor swim under the terrible eyes of prison ships

 during the second world war i was going home one night along a street i seldom used all the stores were closed except onea small fruit store an old italian was inside to wait on customers as i was paying him i saw that he was sad “you are sad” i said “what is troubling you” “yes” he said “i am sad” then he added in the same monotone not looking at me “my son left for the front today and i’ll never see him again” “don’t say that” i said “of course you will” “no” he answered “i’ll never see him again”  afterwards when the war was over i found myself once more in that street and again it was late at night dark and lonely and again i saw the old man alone in the store i bought some apples and looked closely at him his thin wrinkled face was grim but not particularly sad “how about your son” i said “did he come back from the war” “yes” he answered “he was not wounded” “no he is all right” “that’s fine” i said “fine” he took the bag of apples from my hands and groping inside took out one that had begun to rot and put in a good one instead “he came back at christmas” he added “how wonderful that was wonderful” “yes” he said gently “it was wonderful” he took the bag of apples from my hands again and took out one of the smaller apples and put in a large one

 1  look here marcus aurelius we’ve come to see your temple deluded the guards crawled through a hole in the fence why your descendent my guide and friend  has opted for secrecy i don’t know but i do know what to call the africans passportless yelloweyed who will ride the boat before me for naples they hope  here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter storm like a cough or the seadog drops them at hannibal’s shores where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants  what dimension of time will they cross at the hours loop tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists what siren song will the trucks shipping them back  to ouagadougou drone into their ears i look at them loitering waiting for the second act of their darkness to fall i look at the sky shake her dicey fists  one can be thankful i suppose for not being one of them and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself to keep the cold wind at bay but what world is this  that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s rope is about to snap while the sea and sky ache to become an openended road that’s what we’re all waiting for  a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit and let us in on its sweetness as we wait smoking or fondling provisions listening the engine’s invocational purr in an hour  that will dawn and dusk at once one that will stretch into days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star  begins to float on the water so bright and still you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand   2  a pair of roman fists robbed of spear and shield the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn  that slipped from the buttery hands aluminum wrappers smudged with processed cheese  countless cigarette butts surround the fallen columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam  pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…  the ruins are not ruined without all this garbage packed stratified how else to name our age   3  earlier i had walked the market of sabratha changed to its people but like my old city brought me back to me the petty merchants all selling the same goods shouted out jokes to each other a sudanese waiter carried a tray with a giant pot of green tea with mint among the older men  their heads capped with crimson shennas i kept seeking my father’s face an old lust wafted past me when the abayaclad women scented with knockoff chanel sashayed by the sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves  with spoons of searing harissa my mouth watering to a childhood burn pyramids of local oranges late season pomegranates radish and turnip bulbs stacked like billiard balls and the half carcasses of lambs as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks  the trays of hearts kidneys brains and testicles arrayed in slick arabesques the handwoven rugs where the extinct mouflon thrives mincers hairdryers and toasters their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves  it was as if my eyes were painting not seeing what i saw my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole what face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration i know what the eyes of the men my age said settled now in comfortable middle age about the life i left behind  true i did envy them the asceticism of their grace where a given horizon becomes a birthrightto drive or walk past the same hills all your life to eat from the same tree and drink from the well that gave you your name   4  though for centuries the locals broke the statues’ limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery enough remains to echo all that has disappeared  you and the woman leave the towpath and you brace her against the trunk of an oak it’s not the moonlight but refractions from suburban homes trapped under cloudcover that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees  first god made love the canopy like the inside of an emerald her lips a rush of cochineal then a route of evanescence brought her from carthage into these living arms here   5  “a nice time “ he tells us how he and four cousins crossed the desert heading home on top of threeyears’ worth of meager pay the tarp ballooning a giant dough roped to a truck  wearing the goggles of the welder hed hoped to become he looked at the sky and wondered “what those flying smoke on their tails thought of us”  later deported in a cargo plane he handed the tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports and they like “space aliens” in shabby uniforms sunglasses tribal veils poured into his face  as the propellers’ hammering calmed to a shuddering hum he saw the stars “hundreds of them like gnats” swarm mt akakous’ peak  “my next road is the water” he says serving us tonight and we promise if the coffee is good to put him on the next boat to the moon shining over syracuse   6  suddenly i find your descendant’s hands leafing through my chapters scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts  “how is it” he asks “that starlight announces the hour how can a song divide desire in two”  “my flame” i must have written or said “coated her body like silk one kiss spreading threads of lightening  into her pores until she became a sob barely lifted by the wind and i became mist the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn”   to that he responds “a platonic echo” and “what will come of such a plasticine love”  marcus aurelius your descendent knows i’ll leave as i arrive so empty he gets lost in me   7  two centuries ago one of my ancestors sat on one of the communal latrines in midmorning and listened to apuleius’s defense across from him on that marble hexagon sat two other men on normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest  the feast of venus coming soon but today they listen to the madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes cracking their own oneliners shaking their heads in delight away from the hot midday sun and the throngs  you could say they had the best seats in the house and so they lingered and heard as much as they could then went about their business so what if a man maries an older woman for her money what impoverished young roman in his right mind wouldn’t do that and sure too if some man  comes to take your inheritance even if he’s your best friend even if he takes good care of your mother you’d be a fool not to sue him to the council even if you’d have to accuse him falsely of black magic that’s the beauty of it or rather  whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty that things being already right can be more right which is what “beautiful” really means and what better way to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life   8  marcus aurelius the men at the shore follow your path into eternity though they already see their journey as a quarrel with circumstance their lives abscesses feeding  on the universe’s hide tumors in detention camps in basement kitchens their pockets filled with drachmas they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet leadheavy with shame  one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia with enough of the language to understand direction he engages his late night passengers in the light of the dashboard  they’ll entrust him with their secrets with time he’ll become a light unto himself his car a winged chariot of human folly and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark  soil of philosophy it’s the gift of seasons that stray from the earth when soul reigns incidental to flesh forgiving to no end a light that has long surpassed itself   9  the birds that drew the line to the first distance remain nameless to me  creamy white breasts gold dust around their eyes blackbrown dark roast wings  the deserts they crossed the plains east or north of here fall like sand from my hands  um bsisi i want to call them citizens of a protracted destiny native and stranger prodigal and peasant  admit now they you’re none of these that you’re not any or even all of them combined   10  southwest of here is apuleius’s hometown his inescapable destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies “lacking the poverty of the rich” he’s splurged a monthlong trip to the olympic games and openhanded he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries  few return to madaura once gone and when heading back shamefaced like him they’d do as he did taking the longest route hoping the journey would never end here in sabratha the widow hooked him or he let her reel him and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began  i look out toward madaura my back to the theater and the latrines madaura birthplace of augustine site of his first schoolinglittle augustine holding a satchel of scrolls and a  loaf of bread for the teacher awakened by his mother  his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals his stomach warm with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make forced to slurp it sweetened with honey from the atlas a sprinkling of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm  if the world is that sweet and warm if it is that mothering why then this perpetual scene of separation this turning out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love  he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own he refuses the warm porridge forever renounces his mother’s embrace it only lasted a month  this partial answer because even then everyone knew that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens  and deepens like the sea before them a place meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth that’s why prophets were welcomed here calmly because god was like rain and they like the saplings  which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn and that’s why africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished visible from the next town over and for fifty leagues from the sea if it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come  the merchant who’d built it money made from smuggling subsidized goods to carthage and used renaults from rotterdam ran out of money could not afford the mosque that was to stand next to it leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun there’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought  it’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers some without life jackets had never learned how to swim why not let them live in text as they do in lifethey’ve lived without words for so longwhy not release them from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion   11  in a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binoculars trying to catch a glimpse of the ramadan crescent and if these migrants stick around here time will belong to the departure of other travelers  flocks of um bsisi follwing the sun’s arch japanese and korean trawlers sailing to gibraltar or suez chasing the last herring or sardine  where is she now in her time her life dissolved in other people’s minutes a sense of solitude her diligent companion even when she lets go of herself to kindness  he’ll be there when she returns from the party he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps he’ll say “time belongs to the species but your life belongs to me”  she’ll laugh at his words and remember what you marcus aurelius had said about losing only the moment at hand how it circles in a ring of dead nerves how we stand impoverished before what is to come  she’ll have her answer to your elocution she’d always had an answer for you one she refuses to share even with herself   12  at last they set to sail they slaughter a rooster douse blood on the dido figurehead adorning the prow the seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah his egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater  twists the brass head into it caking the slit with sand he fills the clay bowl with appleflavored tobacco wraps it with foil pokes it tenderly with a knife he picks embers from the going fire places a few  on the aluminum crown and inhales and blows until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog the color of semen i think then hands the pipe hose to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over  to the travelers in turn the air smells sweet around us the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine their communion done they embark except the one who stands the dead rooster in his hand as if wanting  to entrust it to us then digs a hurried hole to bury it in the boat barely visible leaves a leaden lacey ribbon aiming directly for the burnt orange sun as it reddens for a moment their standing silhouettes eclipse it  then the sea restores its dominion dark as the coffee cooling in our cups dangling from the vine arbor the lights reflect a constellation on the table’s dark top i trace my fingers among them hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus  between my unquiet eddies marcus aurelius and the coursing water the travelers’ moment sails its tentacles sewing a rupture i had nursed for too long

 i invocation  its crazy to think one could describe them calling on reason fantasy memory eyes and ears as though they were all alike any more  than sweeps opticians poets or masseurs moreover they are for more than one reason difficult to speak of seriously and freely  and i have never even this is difficult to say plainly without foolishness or irony consulted one for professional help though it happens  many or most of my friends haveand that perhaps is why it seems urgent to try to speak sensibly about them about the psychiatrists   ii some terms  “shrink” is a misnomer the religious analogy is all wrong too and the old halfforgotten jokes about viennese accents  and beards hardly apply to the goodlooking woman in boots and a knit dress or the man seen buying the sunday times in muttonchop  whiskers and expensive running shoes in a way i suspect that even the terms “doctor” and “therapist” are misnomers the patient  is not necessarily “sick” and one assumes that no small part of the psychiatrist’s role is just that to point out misnomers   iii proposition  these are the first citizens of contingency far from the doctrinaire past of the old ones they think in their prudent meditations  not about ecstasy the soul leaving the body nor enthusiasm the god entering one’s person nor even about sanity which means  health an impossible perfection but ponder instead relative truth and the warm dusk of amelioration the cautious  young augurs with their familylife good books and records and foreign cars believe in ameliorationin that and in suffering   iv a lakeside identification  yes crazy to suppose one could describe them and yet there was this incident at the local beach clouds of professors and the husbands of professors  swam dabbled or stood to talk with arms folded gazing at the lake  and one of the few townsfolk there with no faculty statusa matteroffact competent  catholic woman of twentyseven with five children and a firstrate bodypointed her finger at the back of one certain man and asked me  “is that guy a psychiatrist” and by god he was “yes” she said “he looks like a psychiatrist” grown quiet i looked at his pink back and thought   v physical comparison with professors and others  pink and a bit softbodied with a somewhat jazzy middleclass bathing suit and sandy sideburns to me he looked from the back like one more professor  and from the front toothe boyish unformed carriage which foreigners always note in american men combined as in a professor with that liberal quizzical  articulate gaze so unlike the more focused more tolerant expression worn by a man of action surgeon salesman athlete on closer inspection was there  perhaps a selfsatisfied benign air a too studied gentleness toward the child whose hand he held loosely absurd to speculate but thenthe woman saw something   vi their seriousness with further comparisons  in a certain sense they are not serious that is they are serioususeful deeply helpful concernedonly in the way that the pilots of huge  planes radiologists and master mechanics can at their best be serious but however profound the psychiatrists may be they are not serious the way  a painter may be serious beyond pictures or a businessman may be serious beyond property and cashor even the way scholars and surgeons are serious each rapt  in his work’s final cause contingent upon nothing beyond work persons recoveries and this is fitting who would want to fly with a pilot who was serious  about getting to the destination safely terrifying idea that a pilot could overextend perhaps try to fly too well or suffer from pilot’s block of course  it may be that just as they must not drink liquor before a flight they undergo regular required checkups with a psychiatrist to prevent such things from happening   vii historical the bacchae  madness itself as an idea leaves us confused incredulous that it exists or cruelly facetious or stricken with a superstitious awe as if bound  by the lost cults of trebizond and pergamum  the most profound study of madness is found in the bacchae of euripides so deeply disturbing  that in cambridge massachusetts the players evaded some of the strongest unsettling material by portraying poor sincere fuddled decent pentheus  as a sort of fascistic bureaucratbut it is dionysus who holds rallies instills exaltations of violence with his leopards and atavistic troops above law  reason and the good sense and reflective dignity of pentheuspentheus humiliated addled made to suffer atrocity as a minor jest of the smirking god  when bacchus’s chorus who call him “most gentle” observe “ten thousand men have ten thousand hopes some fail some come to fruit but the happiest man is he  who gathers the good of life day by day”as though life itself were enoughdoes that mean to leave ambition and is it a kind of therapy or truth or both   viii a question  on the subject of madness the bacchae seems on the whole more pro than contra the chorus says of wine “there is no other medicine for misery”  when the queen in her ecstasyor her enthusiasm tears her terrified son’s arm from his body or bears his head on her spear she remains happy so long  as she remains crazy the god himself who bound fawnskin to the women’s flesh armed them with ivy arrows and his orgies’ livery debases poor pentheus first  then leads him to mince capering towards female death and dismemberment flushed grinning the grave young king of thebes pulls at a slipping brastrap simpers  down at his turned anklepentheus“should i lift up mount cithæronbacchae mother and all” dionysus “do what you want to do your mind  was unstable once but now you sound more sane you are on your way to great things” the question is which is the psychiatrist pentheus or dionysus   ix pentheus as psychiatrist  with his reasonable questions pentheus tries to throw light on the old customs of savagery like a brave doctor he asks about it all  he hears everything “weird fantastic things” the messenger calls them with their breasts swollen their new babies abandoned mothers  among the bacchantes nestled gazelles and young wolves in their arms and suckled them you might see a single one of them tear a fat calf  in two still bellowing with fright while others clawed heifers to pieces ribs and hooves were strewn everywhere bloodsmeared scraps  hung from the fir trees furious bulls charged and then fell stumbling pulled down to be stripped of skin and flesh by screaming women   and pentheus listened flames burned in their hair unnoticed thick honey spurted from their wands and the snakes they wore like ribbons licked  hot blood from their flushed necks pentheus was the man the people told  “weird things” like a middleclass fantasy of release and when even  the old menbent cadmus and tiresiasdress up in fawnskin and ivy beating their wands on the ground trying to carouse it is pentheusdowntoearth  soberwho raises his voice in the name of dignity being a psychiatrist how could he attend to the chorus’s warning against “those who aspire” and “a tongue without reins”   x dionysus as psychiatrist  in a more hostile view the psychiatrists are like bacchusthe knowing smirk of his mask his patients his confident guidance of passion  and even his little jokes as when the great palace is hit by lightning which blazes and stays bouncing among the crumpled stone walls   and through the burning rubble he comes with his soft ways picking along lightly with a calm smile for the trembling chorus  who have fallen to the ground bowing in the ungreek eastern waywhat asian women he asks were you disturbed just now when bacchus  jostled the palace he warns pentheus to adjust to learn the ordinary man’s humble sense of limits violent limits to the rational world he cures  pentheus of the grand delusion that the dark urgencies can be governed simply by the mind and the mind’s will he teaches queen agave to look  up from her loom up at the light at her tall son’s head impaled on the stiff spear clutched in her own hand soiled with dirt and blood   xi their philistinism considered  “greek tragedy” of course is the sort of thing they like and like the idea of  though not “tragedy” in the sense of newspapers when a patient shot one of them  people phoned in many upset as though a deep special rule had been abrogated someone had gone too far the poor doctor as described by the evening globe  turned out to be a decent conventional man doctors for peace b’nai brith numerous articles almost carefully so like paul valéryor like rex morgan md who  in the same globe attends a concert with a longjawed woman first panel“we’re a little early for the concert there’s an art museum we can stroll through” “i’d

 farming family 1912 by august sander  the cruelty of the men when they’re alone the women’s tiredness and resignation do not get multiplied as you’d expect when the extended families collect one day a year to get their pictures taken it’s not that any of their faces soften nor that there’s any obvious affection between the farmer’s mother and his son and only an idealist could see in this brief cutting from the family tree a symbol of the strength of rootedness three generations dwelling in one place knowing how soon the root will lose its branch cut down and hacked to pieces in a trench the only explanation that makes sense for the illusion of resilience that lights their eyes and makes them look at home is that with every added generation buried potentialities appear the son who poses strumming his guitar refutes his father’s brandished iron cross no more convincingly than his bare face proves that his father’s beard is obsolete denying one another they complete their likeness to the contradictory god who commanded us to multiply so he could manifest in every birth another of his attributes on earth

 nothing is known about helen but her voice strange glittering sparks lighting no fires but what is reechoed rechorded set on the icy sea  all history is one as all the north pole is one magnetic music to play with ice that has had to do with vision and each one of us naked partners naked                  helen a revision zeus it is to be assumed that i do not exist while most people in the vision assume that i do exist this is to be one of the extents of meaning between the players and the audience i have to talk like this because i am the lord of both kinds of skyand i dont mean your sky and their sky because they are signs i mean the bright sky and the burning sky i have no intention of showing you my limits the players in this poem are players they have taken their parts not to deceive you or me for that matter but because they have been paid in love or coin to be players i have known for a long time that there is not a fourth wall in a play i am called zeus and i know this  thersites running out on the construction of the stage the fourth wall is not as important as you think it is  zeus disturbed but carrying it off like a good master of ceremonial thersites is involuntary he puts his arm around him i could not play a part if i were not a player  thersites reveal yourself to me and dont pretend that there are people watching you i am alone on the stage with you tell me the plot of the play  zeus standing away dont try to talk if you dont have to you must admit there is no audience everything is done for you  thersites stop repeating yourself you old motherfucker your skies are bad enough he looks to the ground a parody is better than a pun  zeus i do not understand your language  they are silent together for a moment and then the curtain drops                   and if he dies on this road throw wild blackberries at his ghost and if he doesnt and he wont hope the cost hope the cost  and the tenor of the what meets the why at the edge like a backwards image of each terrors lodge each terrors lodge  and if he cries put his heart out with a lanterns goat where they say all passages to pay the debt the lighted yet                   the focus sing is not their business their backs lay by not altogether being there here and there in swamps and villages how doth the silly crocodile amuse the muse                  and in the skyey march of flesh that boundary line where no body is preserve us lord from aches and harms and bring my death  both air and water rattle there and mud and fire preserve us lord from what would share a shroud and bring my death  a vagrant bird flies to the glossy limbs the battlefield has harms the trees have half their branches shot away preserve us lord from hair and mud and flesh

 i   cook was a captain of the admiralty when seacaptains had the evil eye or should have what with beating krakens off and casting nativities of ships cook was a captain of the powderdays when captains you might have said if you had been fixed by their glittering stare halfdown the side or gaping at them up companionways were more like warlocks than a humble man and men were humble then who gazed at them poor horneyed sailors bullied by devils’ fists of wind or water or the want of both childlike and trusting filled with eager trust cook was a captain of the sailing days when seacaptains were kings like this not cold executives of companyrules cracking their boilers for a dividend or bidding their engineers go wink at bells and telegraphs so plates would hold another pound those captains drove their ships by their own blood no laws of schoolbook steam till yards were sprung and masts went overboard daemons in periwigs doling magic out who read fair alphabets in stars where humbler men found but a mess of sparks who steered their crews by mysteries and strange halfdreadful sortilege with books used medicines that only gods could know the sense of but sailors drank in simple faith that was the captain cook was when he came to the coral sea and chose a passage into the dark  how many mariners had made that choice paused on the brink of mystery ‘choose now’ the winds roared blowing home blowing home over the coral sea ‘choose now’ the trades cried once to tasman throwing him for choice their teeth or shoulders and the dutchman chose the wind’s way turning north ‘choose bougainville’ the wind cried once and bougainville had heard the voice of god calling him prudently out of the dead lee shore and chose the north the wind’s way so too cook made choice over the brink into the devil’s mouth with four months’ food and sailors wild with dreams of english beer the smoking barns of home so cook made choice so cook sailed westabout so men write poems in australia   ii   flowers turned to stone not all the botany of joseph banks hung pensive in a porthole could find the latin for this loveliness could put the barrier reef in a glass box tagged by the horrid gorgon squint of horticulture stone turned to flowers it seemedyou’d snap a crystal twig one petal even of the watergarden and have it dying like a cherrybough they’d sailed all day outside a coral hedge and half the night cook sailed at night let there be reefs a fathom from the keel and empty charts the sailors didn’t ask nor joseph banks who cared it was the spell of cook that lulled them bade them turn below kick off their seaboots puff themselves to sleep though there were more shoals outside than teeth in a shark’s head cook snored loudest himself  one day a morning of light airs and calms they slid towards a reef that would have knifed their boards to mash and murdered every man so close it sucked them one wave shook their keel the next blew past the coral three officers in gilt and buttons languidly on deck pointed their sextants at the sun one yawned one held a pencil one put eye to lens three very peaceful english mariners taking their sights for longitude i’ve never heard of sailors aching for the longitude of shipwrecks before or since it was the spell of cook did this the phylacteries of cook men who ride broomsticks with a mesmerist mock the typhoon so too it was with cook   iii   two chronometers the captain had one by arnold that ran like mad one by kendal in a walnut case poor devoted creature with a hangdog face  arnold always hurried with a crazed clickclick dancing over greenwich like a lunatic kendal panted faithfully his watchdog beat climbing out of yesterday with sticky little feet  arnold choked with appetite to wolf up time madly round the numerals his hands would climb his cogs rushed over and his wheels ran miles dragging captain cook to the sandwich isles  but kendal dawdled in the tombstoned past with a sentimental prejudice to going fast and he thought very often of a haberdasher’s door and a yellowhaired boy who would knock no more  all through the nighttime clock talked to clock in the captain’s cabin tocktocktock one ticked fast and one ticked slow and time went over them a hundred years ago   iv   sometimes the god would fold his wings and stone of caesars turned to flesh talk of the most important things that seriousminded midshipmen could wish  of plantains and the lack of rum or spearing seacowsthings like this that hungry schoolboys five days dumb in jollyboats are wonted to discuss  what midshipman would pause to mourn the sun that beat about his ears or curse the tide if he could horn his fists by tugging on those lumbering oars  let rumtanned mariners prefer to hug the weatherside of yards ‘cats to catch mice’ before they purr those were the captain’s enigmatic words  here in this jollyboat they graced were food and freedom wind and storm while fowlingpiece across his waist cook mapped the coast with one eye cocked for game   v   after the candles had gone out and those who listened had gone out and a last wave of chimneyhaloes caked their smoky rings like fishscales on the ceiling a yellow sea of swimming circles the old man old captaininthecorner drank his rum with friendly gestures to four chairs they stood empty still warm from haunches with rubbed nails and leather glazed like aged servingmen feeding a king’s delight the sticky drugged sweet agony of habitual anecdotes but these his chairs could bear an old man’s tongue sleep when he slept be flattering when he woke and wink to hear the same eternal name from lips newdipped in rum  ‘then captain cook i heard him told them they could go if so they chose but he would get them back dead or alive he’d have them’ the old man screeched halfthinking to hear ‘cook cook again cook it’s other cooks he’ll need cooks who can bake a dinner out of pence that’s what he lives on talks on halfacrown a day and sits there full of cook who’d do your cooking now i’d like to ask if someone didn’t grind her bones away but that’s the truth six children and halfacrown a day and a man gone daft with cook’  that was his wife elizabeth a noble wife but brisk who lived in a present full of kitchenfumes and had no past he had not seen her for seven years being blind and that of course was why he’d had to strike a deal with chairs not knowing when those who chafed them had gone to sleep or stolen away darkness and empty chairs this was the port that alexander home had come to with his useless cutlasswounds and tales of cook and halfacrown a day this was the creek he’d run his timbers to where grateful countrymen repaid his wounds at halfacrown a day too good too good this eloquent offering of birdcages to gulls and greenwich hospital to cook britannia’s mission to the seafowl  it was not blindness picked his flesh away nor want of sight made pennyblank the eyes of captain home but that he lived like this in one place and gazed elsewhere his body moved in scotland but his eyes were dazzlefull of skies and water farther round the world air soaked with blue so thick it dripped like snow on spicetree boughs and water diamondgreen beaches windglittering with crumbs of gilt and birds more scarlet than a duchy’s seal that had come whistling long ago and far away his body had gone back here it sat drinking rum in berwickshire but not his eyesthey were left floating there halfround the earth blinking at beaches milked by suckmouth tides foaming with ropes of bubbles and huge halfmoons of surf thus it had been when cook was carried on a sailor’s back vengeance in a cocked hat to claim his price a prince in barter for a longboat and then the trumpery springs of fatea stone a musketshot a round of gunpowder and puzzled animals killing they knew not what or why but killing    the surge of goatish flanks armoured in feathers like cruel birds wild childish faces killing a moment seen marines with crimson coats and puffs of smoke toppling facedown and a knife of english iron forged aboard ship that had been changed for pigs given back to cook between the shoulderblades there he had dropped and the old floundering sea the old fumbling witless loverenemy had taken his breath last office of salt water  cook died the body of alexander home flowed round the world and back again with eyes marooned already and came to english coasts the vague ancestral darknesses of home seeing them faintly through a glass of gold dim fogshapes ghosted like the ribs of trees against his blazing waters and blue air but soon they faded and there was nothing left only the sugarcane and the wild granaries of sand andpalmtrees and the flying blood of cardinalbirds and putting out one hand tremulously in the direction of the beach he felt a chair in scotland and sat down

 at a small monasteryor what had been a monasteryoutside obrégon we stopped you were suffering the hollow nausea of your first pregnancy sleeping as best you could through the thousand miles of pines and rocky fields of northern mexico so i went ahead through the saddlecolored rooms past the broken church and the row of empty sheds where indian women according to a sign once baked the flat bread called sapatos de maria to a garden in the back over the parapet of which i could see the river through some willows a rinsed bed of sand dry now in winter i didn’t want a child and i was tired of closeness tired of being kind so was glad to be alone a while and lay down under a jacaranda tree and watched through leaves the changing pattern of the sky which i was tired of too the scaly stratospheric winter clouds edged with light like the tiny waves you pointed out reflected on the bottom of a bridge we rowed under in a rented boat the day you told me of the childi was tired and slept  it was nearly evening when i woke two mestizo women hurried talking through the tulip beds the sky was pale they’d set small plaques among the plants naming them the ornamentals and the fruit some so the writing said were descendants of the cuttings brought from spain by monks intermingled herepinot grape with ocotillo damascena rosethey thrived i thought of certain tenderness and forbearance a man might bring to vines and simple vegetables cultivated in memory of his home perhaps in a foreign place and thought how sometimes what passes on from us has little to do with what we hoped but nonetheless carries word of who we were and what we found for a moment then among the arbors and the flower beds i did not feel so distant from this time and place and the edge of my own local fears began to dull i plucked a spriga leaf was all from a holly bush and brought it out to you a little stronger in a portion of myself a little reconciled though i couldn’t know then that in a month we would lose the child and in time you would pass like a squandered fortune from my life

 the mountain north of pasadena has severe and angular back canyons where the light is always unexpected out of place too simple for the clutter of the granite blocks along the creeks the slopes have low rough shrubs some firebreaks it rains sometimes and then the soils wash easily through rubio and eaton canyons to the small catchbasins and the storage tanks the bedrocks tilt toward the west and so the seepage drains that way along a wall of the arroyo it comes down in springs named tibbets ivy flutterwheel these are the only steady water and the indiana colony had hauled it out in tubs and barrels to their lots they’d cleared the greasewood from the flats and planted groves of orange and peach trees built their houses in the california style with battened redwood boards nearer the arroyo on its terraces they saved a few live oak they’d have december picnics there and afterward would walk from that side down the bluff the floor was cool and there were sycamore and alder loose irregular new channels through the willows on the other side and south below the san rafaels more oak the sun they’d take a new way back their lots extended east to the lake vineyard land and water company and as a grudging compromise between that tract and theirs the central school was built in the dry neat rows of the orchards east of where they lived excursion parties from the middle west were taken mostly with the climate at the citrus fairs the charts and produce showed them that it didn’t freeze storms were rare and offered the consoling interest of a flood in the arroyo loud and stupid boulders the size of safes colliding down the wash a new hotel faced south on colorado like the ward block to its right across fair oaks it was substantial frame with dormers and brick chimneys each had its widow’s walk and looked as much like boston as it needed to someone from los angeles brought in a telephone he hooked it up in the store on the southeast corner rode back downtown and called and asked for soandso who wasn’t there from that one crossing there were fewer lots each month new storefronts and more traffic speculating boomers and pikers midnight sales bands and free lunches at the auctions owners were induced to move east on colorado to more eligible locations but the crossstreets led through dusty tentlined orchards to the chaparral the boom came back toward the center and was done what they’d been selling was the weather and a place to live and that was what was left as their one industry the novelty works of mr wakeley went on stuffing scorpions and trapdoor spiders horny toads small animals and birds the balance of trade was not in pasadena’s favor but there were jobs james scoville kept men doing rockwork on the banks above his groves the arroyo narrowed there and so he had them build a pumphouse and a dam and turn a railroad trestle upside down between two concrete footings this was the central bridge it crossed to open ranchland that would subdivide more slowly than the woodlots on the bluffs another bridge la loma farther south was taller with a wider span and sycamores around its girders it had replaced the johnston bridge and made it easier to sell the tracts the wealth of the invisible elite went into homes on grand and orange grove raymond nithsdale rd arroyo terrace bellefontaine new bungalows that looked much less expensive than they were in their commissions charles and henry greene used common and available materials stones from the arroyo bricks a simple flexible pine frame of 2 x 4s and handsplit cedar shakes porches that were railed with the same rough timber as the posts and beams and trusses and the overhanging rafters for the roof their costs were mostly labor they’d show the workers where they wanted terraces and knolls what trees and shrubs to save a local factory expanded to keep up with them and they’d make daily visits there to oversee the millmen and the carvers or the quality of lumber that had just been shipped their mason did exactly what they called for on retainingwalls the color of the fill which stone or clinker at what angle to the rest each minor thing they cared about earned what it had to do with matters that were not their business where the money for a house had come from what the mayor had in mind or public works or how the street would look with lights affairs like these beyond the garden stayed accessible a movement to and from the house implicit in its horizontal lines the roof was long and relatively flat beams above the frames of doors and windows were much broader than the frames themselves and paralleled the covered entryways and porches even the stairs inside were less than vertical each section of the railing carved from a single piece of teak and joined to all the other teakthe notched and interlocking kickplates the splines and level boards that were the facing of the well their stairs were furniture a bench along a landing had the same insistent finish as the inglehook the same square ebony caps for screwheads as the chairs and tables everything showed you how it went together a scarf or boxjoint metal straps continuous sure banding from the hallway into any room there was tile and leaded glass but it was mostly woodmahoganies and walnuts oak redwood or white cedar wainscots doweled and pegged loose furniture in teak or birch or lignumvitae a smooth selflubricating wood that didn’t crack the grain inside was outside too in rafters and stiff rounded beamends that were oiled and rubbed they looked penetrable to light looked as if they could absorb and carry it at any single time toward the one best place inside lucile’s house on holliston was miles from the arroyo but it was imitation greene amp greene a less impressive version of their simplest large twostory frames its eaves on both the north and south reached almost to the neighbors’ lots lots that for several blocks each way repeated themselves with slightly different houses the man she’d bought it from was still a pharmacist at lake and villa he didn’t know me and i never spoke to him he had a massive tumor on his neck and jaw and i would be amazed each time i saw him that he wasn’t dead until a year or so before he’d sold the house there’d been an organ with the pipes extending to an upstairs bedroom probably the room across the hall from donna’s there would have been no floor between the first and second stories our den and sewing room a single shaftlike chamber that the sound would fill it’s just as likely that the floor had been there all along exactly as we knew it with the organ somewhere else but of all the rooms downstairs only the den could open to the room above it with the ranks of pipes along the wall that backed against the stairs there would have been high windows to the south and west and possibly around three sides a thin railed walk one got to from the upstairs hall i might let myself care more about how well or what he played if it were clearer to me how the organ looked if i know anything about its wood i know it from the oakframe sliding doors between the den and living room so if the console had been quartered oak the case was walnutno tracery around the pipes the same plain cuts as for the cabinets and counters everywhere downstairs how many manuals there were or knobs with nameplates for the pitches and the stops if the bench was free or fixed or whether the pedals for the naturals were strips that flared slightly in their alignment toward the darker sharps the whole clear shape of it in that one place remains as closed to me as how it worked as the feeders and the reservoirs the valves the layers of coarse felt between the double panels of the swellbox as how the sliders kept the air below the upperboards and pipes and let it go and let it sound the way he wanted it to sound the wind inside the pipe striking against a lip and coming back contained and vibrant for the time he kept it there its shock to the air outside the pipe was how it sounded the way he wanted it to sound or as it might have sounded if the room were larger and the sounds dispersed and mixed less palpably went on together with the light or darkness in the room there wouldn’t have been time between the sounds to count them to be sure that nothing of the piece was missing nor was there time for me at any moment in the sewing room to know the changes that the light had worked downstairs not that i would have tried to know or done much more than suffer my current fit of pouting i’d hear lucile walk past the stairs toward the kitchen in her busy selfimportant way maybe she’d leave from a back window of the sewing room i’d see her in her car and starting out the driveway these were the least obstructed windows in the house late in the day haze showed its tired agreement with the house next door the shingles dull and olive like the rusted screens the asphalt paper on the roof i could see my aunt’s back yard on chester trees as far west of us as lake marked off the streets in staggered elevationspalms short rows of deodars and jacarandas at night from a window in the southern wall the top three letters on the tower for the academy kept coming on one at a time then all together    richard arkwright was a barber he toured the markets and the farms and bought the hair of country girls and made it into wigs when he hired john kay to build a frame for spinning thread from the strands of cotton manufacture was domesticlooms and jennies in the kitchens of the small freeholders and the farmers who would sell their cloth to merchants wool was the english staple trade a privilege of the landed graziers all gentlemen wore silk raw cotton was a coarse adherent fiber from brazil and the antilles it had to be opened and cleaned and have its strands laid parallel by two large cards that worked it back and forth between them drawing made the slivers equal in thickness by redoubling them and roving made them thicker still and left them ready to be spun arkwright’s waterframe replaced the hand’s inexpert pulling and pushing movements that begin and end and can’t repeat themselves exactly at cromford with the money of two hosiers he built a gaslit mill above the derwent he needed journeymen clockmakers who did tooth and pinion a smith who forged and filed afraid that no one man would know “all that i should expect he might” he was “determined to let no person see the works” he wanted “locks and hangings for the windows good latches for the outer doors and for the inner doors as well” to make the other money come to him he specified as little as he could in all his patents and as he sold the plans he built six factories in lancashire at glasgow he was made an honorary burgess and was taken to the falls of clyde at new lanark where he would build another mill he advertised for weavers frameworkknitters children who were seven could have constant employment in the riot against machines they burned his mill near chorley he was threatened “i will lie in wait for you in this town nottingham or wherever i most likely to find you i will ashure shute you as your name is what it is dam you do you think the town must be ruled by such a barber as you” contemporaries thought he was a newton or napoleon he was knighted and named high sheriff of derbyshire he claimed that he could pay the national debt if he were left alone to make his money and when he died the income from his mills was more than that of most german principalities he was asthmatic an economist of time he worked at english grammar as he traveled in a postchaise with four horses driven always at top speed he lost his patents at a trial in 1785 the industry was open in the damp valleys at breaks in the long profiles of the streams new spinning mills went up they were too far outside the towns to worry that they’d be inspectedclose enough to send their thread to upland workshops by the new transpennine turnpike roads or by the new canal that crossed the valley of the calder through the craven drumlins east to the other watershed and leeds there was so much thread that barns were fitted up with handlooms that could weave good fustians and cambrics cotton was its own new country and the landlords feared the moneyed men land could itself be capital the business of the aristocracy each landlord had his broken straggling plots their furrows running lengthwise to the rounded headlands where the plough would turn he knew which land was his but it was open and was grazed collectively by several owners between harvest and sowing even his farmers’ pigs would graze there with the sheep cows grazed the catchwork meadows on the terraces or at the watersides enclosure was the landlords’ plan to change their strips of arable to larger straighter fields they would appropriate the wastesthe marshes and moors the peatbogs where the farmers got their fuel commons had been “a profit which a man hath in the land of another as to pasture beasts thereon cut wood catch fish hunt coneys and the like” in most of the midland parishes there were now acts for enclosure of the open and common fields new roads with wide grass verges to a ditch then quickset hedgerows ash occasional small farmsteads with a croft no lanes the landlord’s manor and his park and in the fields the thickets for his foxes it cost him less to graze than till the stiff clay soils would hold a year of wheat another of spring corn lie fallow the land would yield him more if he could save the labor of his farmers and the cottagers tenure at will was his prerogative to put them off the land when he was through with them as he engrossed more farms they set his hedges drained and marled the looser tracts and planted clover turnips and lucerne he managed breeds of stock and turned them out to graze the even turf across the hillocks enclosure had made “fat beasts and lean poor people” with no one skill peculiar to themselves they left the villages for workshops in the north the earl of leicester said “i look around and see no other house than mine i am like the ogre in the tale and have eaten up all my neighbors”

 i under the makeshift arbor of leaves a hot wind blowing smoke and laughter music out of the renegade west too harsh and loud many dark faces moved among the sweating whites  ii wandering apart from the others i found an old indian seated alone on a bench in the flickering shade  he was holding a dented bucket three crayfish lifting themselves from the muddy water stirred and scraped against the greasy metal  iii the old man stared from his wrinkled darkness across the celebration unblinking as one might see in the hooded sleep of turtles  a smile out of the ages of gold and carbon flashed upon his face and vanished called away by the sound and the glare around him by the lost voice of a child piercing that thronged solitude  iv the afternoon gathered distance and depth divided in the shadows that broke and moved upon us     slowly too slowly as if returned from a long and difficult journey the old man lifted his bucket and walked away into the sunlit crowd   197276

 they caught them they were sitting at a table in the kitchen it was early they had on bathrobes they were drinking coffee and smiling she had one of his cigarillos in her fingers she had her legs tucked up under her in the chair they saw them through the window she thought of them stepping out of a bath and him wrapping cloth around her he thought of her waking up in a small white building he thought of stones settling into the ground then they were gone then they came in through the back her cat ran out the house was near the road she didn’t like the cat going out they stayed at the table the others were out of breath the man and the woman reached across the table they were afraid they smiled the others poured themselves the last of the coffee burning their tongues the man and the woman looked at them they didn’t say anything the man and the woman moved closer to each other the round table between them the stove was still on and burned the empty pot she started to get up one of them shot her she leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons she thought about being beside him being asleep they took her long grey socks put them over the barrel of a rifle and shot him he went back in his chair holding himself she told him hers didn’t hurt much like in the fall when everything you touch makes a spark he thought about her getting up in the dark wrapping a quilt around herself and standing in the doorway she asked the men if they shot them again not to hurt their faces one of them lit him one of his cigarettes he thought what it would be like being children together he was dead before he finished it she asked them could she take it out of his mouth so it wouldn’t burn his lips she reached over and touched his hair she thought about him walking through the dark singing she died on the table like that smoke coming out of his mouth

threadbare old mistake i’ll not repeat a lovely womando you not think so is god’s best work that she is man’s helpmeet the bible says and i will let it go and yet she crowns and makes his life complete who would not shrive himself in her dear face and find his sinless heaven in her embrace   20  young maury loved his slaveshe was his own a gift for all he questioned from the skies not other fortune had he ever known like that which sparkled in her wild blue eyes her sealbrown locks and cheeks like roses blown were wealth to him that e’en the gods might prize and when her slender waist to him he drew the sum of every earthly bliss he knew   21  they had grown up togetherhe and she a world unto themselves all else was bare a desert to them and an unknown sea their lives were like the birds’ livesfree and fair and flowed together like a melody they could not live apart ah silly pair but since she was his slave what need to say a swarm of troubles soon beset their way   22  just in the dawn of blushing womanhood her swanneck glimpsed through shocks of wavy hair a hint of olives in her gentle blood suggesting passion in a rosy lair this shapely venus of the cabins stood in all but birth a princess tall and fair and is it any wonder that this brave and proud young master came to love his slave   28  if it be shame to love a pretty woman then shameful loving is a pretty thing and of all things the most divinely human is thislove purifies life’s fountain spring and he who has not quaffed that fount is no man i’d rather be a lover than a king and then preach as we will or may we’ll find that cupid dear young god is sometimes blind   55  before the world i hold that none of these the shushan slave the oreb shepherdess nor moab’s gleaner ever had the ease of carriage grace of speech the stateliness of step and pose nor had the art to please and charm with symphonies of form and dress nor had such wond’rous eyes such lovely mouth as had this blueeyed daughter lena of the south   56  had priest or prophet ever heard her singing or seen her where the clover was in bloom wading kneedeep while larks were upward springing and winds could scarcely breathe for want of room thus seen her from the dappled hillsides bringing the cows home in the sunset’s golden gloom our good old bible would have had much more of love and romance mixed with sacred lore   57  what man is there who would not dare defend a life like this is doing so a sin or who should blush to be known as her friend white wonder of creation fashioned in the moulds of loveliness kings might contend on martial fields a prize like her to win and yet the cabin’s hate and mansion’s scorn she suffered both betwixt them being born   59  when genial spring first hears the mating thrush where waters gossip and the wild flowers throng love rears her altar in the leafy bush and nature chants the sweetest bridalsong when love is free with madness in its rush its very strength defends the heart from wrong love when untutored walks a harmless way with feet though bare that never go astray   153  mind knows no death life is the “first and last” the falling leaf leaves its source living still the flower which withers in the autumn blast dies not but thus escapes the winter’s chill and will return through changes strange and vast when summoned forth to range o’er vale and hill shall mind which thus perceives life’s changes die hath only matter immortality   156  but “if a man die shall he live again” this baffling question comes from long ago shall ashes only of life’s torch remain the mind cries out and nature answers “no” ye who have heard the prophesying rain and seen the flowery resurrection glow ye know of better things than eye hath seen ye know sere earth is mother of the green   157  the wild moose shivers in the north land’s breath where huron’s wave upbraids the fretful shore the marsh fowl far to southward wandereth and calls her tribes to milder climes explore all nature seems to sigh “remember death for all the living soon shall be no more” but mark how faith sweeps on with tireless wing to find for e’en the fowl an endless spring   159  let scoffers mock let unbelief deny agnosticism stolidly ignore let worldly wisdom proudly ask us “why” and still the soul cries out for something more for something better than philosophy still longs for higher joys and looks before and cannot restwill ne’er contented be till triumph over matter leaves mind free   160  then hail we all the spirits of the just with lena we shall join them all the mind now risen looks down on life’s unmeaning dust and soars to higher spheresall unconfined to spheres of love and duty hope and trust and leaves the sordid and corrupt behind the virgin is the sign of vanquished night her child is bornborn of the soulthe light   161  farewell in grandeur sinks the closing day and on our vision slowly fades the light and bygone scenes like shadows fall away to settle in the blank of coming night the octoroon has passed but not for aye to those who have the gift of inner sight the spirit of all nature prophesies a home for love and beauty in the skies

 twentyeight shotgun pellets crater my thighs belly and groin i gently thumb each burnt bead fingering scabbed stubs with ointment  could have neutered me made extinct the volatile romantic man i am “he’s dead” doctor at emergency room could’ve easily told my wife that night instead “soak him in a bath twice a day apply this ointment to the sores here’s a month’s supply of pain killers” i remember the deep guttural groan i gave when the doctor pressed my groin assured i could still make love morphine drowsed me and in a dull stupor i don’t remember police visiting my bed or laughing so hard they scowled for a serious answer i howled a ufo shot me along the río grande and they cursed and left  in the summer of ’88 i’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf still smelling of milk udders i tied it to the truck rack and drove off its hooves teethed at pink roots ’til the whole lush field went bare dirt a magnificent bull glowing wheel of heart breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn he wrangled his black brawn like a battleshield to challenge the sun reared thick neck down and sideways lunged at me with dart and snort hoofstamped and nostrilled dirt ’til i growled him back whipping air with a limber willow branch poured grain in trough and spread alfalfa i respected his horns and he the whistling menace of willow  one afternoon my cousin patricio helped me band the bull’s scrotum usurp swollen sap in his testicle sack it withered to a pink wattle and seeded the garden to drive cornstalks to bear hardy golden horns  thereafter he grazed the fenceline with the tempered lust and peaceful grace of a celibate priest his bearing now arranged itself elegant as a wild flower sprung over night   perfecto shot it rasping on a black rope of blood round its neck it staggered bouldering convulsions blood exploding in bright lash of earthquaked air it stumblebutted stock trailer fender second and third shots glowed its death  a quivering shadow of lifeflame darkened the air and it sputtered a last drop of blood i drank long swigs of whiskey and thinking it was dead turned to walk away then it gave a tremendous groan tremendous groan a birthletting groan    a moon groan    blood spurted out thick thick thick alleys of dead star blood  and i turned and said aloud to myself “that’s the moon’s voice that’s the moon’s voice”  and the white moon was in the sky and i looked at the moon for a long time   i sat on the ground and gulped whiskey drank the steer’s death still warm in my throat a beautiful animal i allowed to be butchered when it trounced and galloped in the field its body was a dark windy cliff edge and its eyes were doorways of a dream now it bled a charred scroll of ancient chant in gravel i would never know and its blackened logs of blood smoldered dying vowels i would never hear my heart’s creakntremble rage milled the steer’s death to red grist i grieved i wept drunkenly that no one cared that humankind betrayed him that we were all cowards   perfecto valasquez and the butcher tried to stop me from driving but now was the time to settle a bad feud with another friend redeem the bull’s blood with ours i drove to felipe’s house anger knotted in me tight as the rope tied to the stock trailer steer strained against i pulled but could not free myself i had a dream night before i crossed blackiron footbridge partially collapsed by sea storm lefthand railing swept out to sea i gripped boltstudded righthand railing fingerclutched wire netting sides carefully descended waisthigh water waded through slowly and ascended other side but had lost my sunglasses and wallet went back groped bottom found them and ascended again  had to cross that bridge again full of significance    tonight deepest part of flooded bridge was danger    drowning    represented years of my life collapsed and destroyed water the cleansing element my ascent from had healed onto firm ground but i went back to relive destruction… “felipe” i yelled porch light flicked on illuminating the yard “came to fight” i said “take off your glasses”  bugeyes glazed bewildered then gray slits of lips snarled “you motherless dog” he withdrew in darkness a moment reappeared on porch serrated saw of his voice cut the chill dark “¡hijo de su pinche madre ¡mátalo   ¡¡mátalo”  first shot framed darkness round me with a spillway of bright light eruption of sound and second shot roared a spray of brilliance and the third gave an expanded haloflash my legs woozed and then i buckled to the ground i thought holy shit what ever happened to the old yardstyle fight between estranged friends  i groaned with the steer and crawled my dead legs to the truck lunged on elbows into the cab hand lifting the dead stone beneath my waist to clutch and brake  following morning calls came “tell us who did it gato” “our rifles are loaded” i said “leave it alone what would you do if a drunk man came into your yard threatened to beat you” i wanted peace wanted to diffuse the immovable core of vengeance in my heart i had carried since a child dismantle the bloody wheel of violence i had ridden since a child  during my week in bed pellets pollinated me with a forgotten peace and between waking thoughts of anger and vengeance sleep was a small meadow of light a clearing i walked into and rested fragrance of peace filled me as fragrance of flowers and dirt permeate hands that work in the garden all day  curandero came to visit and said “the bull in ancient times was the symbol of females did you know that killing the bull is killing the intuitive part of yourself the feminine part did you realize when jesus was raising lazarus he groaned in his spirit and that bull groaned and when you killed the bull it was raising you the dying bull gave birth to you and now you are either blessed or cursed the flood of that bull’s blood is either going to drown you or liberate you but it will not be wasted”

 whereas a stringbean blueeyed man leans back into a swig of beer workweary lips at the dark bottle keeping cool in short sleeves and khakis he enters the discussion  whereas his wrist loose at the bottleneck to come across as candid “well at least there was an apology that’s all i can say” he offers to the circle each of them scholarly  whereas under starlight the fireflies wink across east coast grass and me i sit there painful in my silence glued to a bench in the midst of the american casual  whereas a subtle electricity in that low purple light i felt their eyes on my face gauging a reaction and someone’s discomfort leaks out in a wellstated “hmmm”  whereas like a bird darting from an oncoming semi my mind races to the apology’s assertion “while the establishment of permanent european settlements in north america did stir conflict with nearby indian tribes peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took place”  whereas i cross my arms and raise a curled hand to my mouth as if thinking as if  taking it in i allow a static quiet then choose to stand up excusing myself  i leave them to unease  whereas i drive down the road replaying the gettogether how the man and his beer bottle stated their piece and i reel at what i could have said or done better  whereas i could’ve but didn’t broach the subject of “genocide” the absence of this term from the apology and its rephrasing as “conflict” for example  whereas since the moment had passed i accept what’s done and the knife of my conscience pierces with boneclean selfhonesty  whereas in a stirred conflict between settlers and an indian that night in a circle  whereas i struggle to confess that i didn’t want to explain anything  whereas truthfully i wished most to kick the legs of that man’s chair out from under him  whereas to watch him fall backward legs flailing beer stench across his chest  whereas i pictured it happening in cinematic slowmotion delightful  whereas the curled hand i raised to my mouth was a sign of indecision  whereas i could’ve done it but i didn’t  whereas i can admit this also took place yesat least  whereas we ride to the airport in a van they swivel their necks and shoulders around to speak to me sugar and lilt in their voices something like nurses their nursely kindness through my hair then engage me as comrades in a fight together well what we want to know one lady asks is why they don’t have schools there her outrage empathy her furrowed brow there are schools there i reply grade schools high schools colleges but why aren’t there any stores there there are stores there grocery stores convenience stores trading posts whatever whathaveyou i explain but it’s here i recognize the break it’s here we roll along the pavement into hills of conversation we share a ride we share a country but live in alternate nations and here i must tell them what they don’t know or should ishould i is the moment to seize and before i know it i say well you know native people as in tribes as in “people” living over there are people with their own nations each with its own government and flag they rise to their own national songs and sing in their own languages even and by there i mean here all around us i remind them drifting in sideglances to whirring trees through the van windows then back to me they dig in they unearth the golden question my god how come we were never taught this in our schools the concern and furrow but god the slowing wheels and we lurch forward in the van’s downshift and brake together we reach a fullstop trapped in a helix of traffic we’re late for checkin security flights our shoulders flex forward into panicked outward gazes nerves and fingers cradle our wristwatches so to answer their question now would be untimely because to really speak to it ever is untimely but there comrades there there nurses i will remember the swing of your gold earringsthere your perfume around me as a fresh blanketthere you checked my pulse kindlythere the boundary of bedside manners whereas a woman i know says she watched a news program a reporter detailed the fire a house in which five children burned perhaps their father too she doesn’t recall exactly but remembers the camera on the mother’s face the mother’s blubbering her hiccuping and wail she leans to me she says she never knew then in those times that year this country the northern state she grew up in she was so young you see she’d never seen it before nobody talked about them she means indians she tells me and so on and so on but that moment in front of the tv she says was like opening a box left at her door opening to see the thing inside whereas to say she learned through that mother’s face can you believe it and i let her finish wanting someone to say it but she hated saying it or so she said admitting how she never knew until then they could feel whereas the word whereas means it being the case that or considering that or while on the contrary is a qualifying or introductory statement a conjunction a connector whereas sets the table the cloth the saltshakers and plates whereas calls me to the table because whereas precedes and invites i have come now i’m seated across from a whereas smile under pressure of formalities i fidget i shake my legs i’m not one for these smiles whereas i have spent my life in unholdingwhat do you mean by unholding whereas asks and since whereas rarely asks i am moved to respond whereas i have learned to exist and exist without your formality saltshakers plates cloth without the slightest conjunctions to connect me without an exchange of questions without the courtesy of answers this has become mine this unholding whereas with or without the setup i can see the dish being served whereas let us bow our heads in prayer now just enough to eat

 the frost performs its secret ministry unhelped by any wind the owlets cry came loudand hark again loud as before the inmates of my cottage all at rest have left me to that solitude which suits abstruser musings save that at my side my cradled infant slumbers peacefully tis calm indeed so calm that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness sea hill and wood this populous village sea and hill and wood with all the numberless goingson of life inaudible as dreams the thin blue flame lies on my lowburnt fire and quivers not only that film which fluttered on the grate  still flutters there the sole unquiet thing methinks its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live making it a companionable form whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets every where echo or mirror seeking of itself and makes a toy of thought  but o how oft how oft at school with most believing mind presageful have i gazed upon the bars to watch that fluttering stranger and as oft with unclosed lids already had i dreamt of my sweet birthplace and the old churchtower whose bells the poor mans only music rang from morn to evening all the hot fairday so sweetly that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come so gazed i till the soothing things i dreamt lulled me to sleep and sleep prolonged my dreams and so i brooded all the following morn awed by the stern preceptors face mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book save if the door half opened and i snatched a hasty glance and still my heart leaped up for still i hoped to see the strangers face townsman or aunt or sister more beloved my playmate when we both were clothed alike  dear babe that sleepest cradled by my side whose gentle breathings heard in this deep calm fill up the intersperséd vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought my babe so beautiful it thrills my heart with tender gladness thus to look at thee and think that thou shalt learn far other lore and in far other scenes for i was reared in the great city pent mid cloisters dim and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars but thou my babe shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores beneath the crags of ancient mountain and beneath the clouds which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language which thy god utters who from eternity doth teach himself in all and all things in himself great universal teacher he shall mould thy spirit and by giving make it ask  therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy appletree while the nightthatch smokes in the sunthaw whether the eavedrops fall heard only in the trances of the blast or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles quietly shining to the quiet moon

 awake in a giant night is where i am there is a river where my soul hungry as a horse drinks beside me  an hour of immense possibility flies by and i do nothing but sit in the present which keeps changing moment to moment  how can i tell you my mind is a blanket  it is an amazing story you won’t believe and a beautiful land where something is always doing in the barns especially in autumn sliding down the hayrick  by march the sun is lingering and the land turns wet  brooks grow loud the eddies fill with green scum crocuses lift their heads to say hello  soon it is good to be planting by then the woods are overflowing with dogwood redbud hickory red and white oaks hazelnut bushes violets jacksinthepulpit skunk cabbages pawpaws and may apples whose names thrill you because you can name them  there are quail and rabbits toobut i go on too long  like the animal i must stop by the water’s edge to have a drink and think things over    that was good the drink i mean i feel refreshed and ready for anything though i’m not in vermont or kentucky unfortunately but in new york city the toughest place in the world  and it’s december  here someone is always weeping including me though i tend to cry in monster waves then turn into a fish wallowing in my own salty puddle look out if you aren’t wearing boots you’ll be sorry and soggy too    this season’s cruelty hurts me and others i’m sure who’d rather be elsewhere but can’t because of their jobs families friends money it’s rough anyway you look at it  but what can you do  it’s worse elsewhere i’m sure  take vietnam  no thanks  i think about vietnam a lot however and wonder if i’ll ever “see” it the way i’ve seen europe i mean  those pretty dutch girls they all ride bicycles  in venice you travel by boat or foot  the metro and the underground register like the names in connection with them  hugo stephen stuart larry lee harry david maxine  what does it all mean i never ask that being shy  in this apartment in which i dwell these thoughts pass by  i hope you won’t mind the mess when you do too    you just walk in up a flight and you’re in paradise  a cup of coffee an easy chair a loving person waiting for you who’s washing the dishes reading a book  outside someone’s worrying about love and not sitting down either  he’s probably freezing his ass off right now and other vital parts which would feel great in the country taking a walk a hike shoveling snow  though you can do that right here    the hub of the universe is where i am in a night whose promise grows with me unlike the snow melting in the gutter  whatever i do it is beside me  i look out the window there is night i sit in this lighted room knowing this night night night i wish you’d go so i could go to the post office the bank the supermarket  why aren’t they open at night i wonder then realize i’m not the only person who’s considered in the grand scope of daily living  there are those fast asleep who want to be and would be horrified if the post office the bank and the supermarket were only open at night for you can’t be all there all the time i myself am only here part of the time which is enough for there are other places to run to  uptown for example where energy rushes you like some hideous but intriguing chemical you can’t ignore and you want to absorb the wisdom these buildings have  how do they feel so high up like that  pretty good they seem to say in their absolute way but it’s the people inside who turn us on  by then you are gone off in a cab and you are not alone  i am beside you  the streets are familiar from just traveling through we rarely stop and when we do there’s a reason  which is too bad we miss a lot for this same reason    they’re probably feeding the chickens about this time the smell of chicken feed overwhelms me the rooster crows on a 7th street fire escape breakfast is ready there is a forest by the river near the barn where things are happening a whole new world on the edge of dawn    my little world goes on st mark’s place  to be not tired but elated i sing this song  i think of the beatles and the beach boys and the songs they sing  it is a different thing to be behind the sound then leave it forever and it goes on without them needing only you and me  here i am though you are asleep  the morning of december 3rd dawns on me in the shape of a poem called “giant night”  it must end before it is too late  all over the world children will celebrate christmas and families will gather together to give and take this season  other religions and customs will prevail in their own separate ways having nothing to do with christmas  soldiers will cease fire  some won’t know the difference but might be able to sense it in the air  the smell of holly pine eggnog the friendly faces of santa and his elves  all these will add up to something and be gone forever  just like what is here one minute and not the next

 so because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night and to stand in the halfset moon with the weird falllight on your glimmering hair till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight and to give me a little scarlet bud that was dying of frost to wear  say must you taunt me forever forever you looked at my hand and you knew that i was the slave of the ring while you were as free as the wind is free when i saw your corpse in your coffin i flung back your flower to you it was all of yours that i ever had you may keep it andkeep from me  ah so god is your witness has god then no world to look after but ours may he not have been searching for that wild stat with the trailing plumage that flew far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings instead of thinking of you  or if he was near us at all do you think that he would sit listening there because you sang “hear me norma” to a woman in jewels and lace while so close to us down in another street in the wet unlighted air there were children crying for bread and fire and mothers who questioned his grace  or perhaps he had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day to number the bloody stabs that were there to look at and judge the dead or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay at least i do not believe that he cares to remember a word that you said  so take back your flowers i tell youof its sweetness i now have no need yes take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep when you wake i will take it and god then perhaps will witness indeed but go now and tell death he must watch you and not let you walk in your sleep

 i  i can hear little clicks inside my dream night drips its silver tap down the back at 4 am i wake thinking  of the man who left in september his name was law  my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it i rinse the face and return to bed tomorrow i am going to visit my mother   she  she lives on a moor in the north she lives alone spring opens like a blade there i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books  some for my mother some for me including the collected works of emily brontë this is my favourite author  also my main fear which i mean to confront whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily brontë  my lonely life around me like a moor my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door what meat is it emily we need    three  three silent women at the kitchen table my mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor paralyzed with ice it extends as far as the eye can see  over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps  once a minute over the twelve i have emily p 216 propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother  a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside my mother is studying her lettuce i turn to p 217  “in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway   ”  it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass now and then a remark trails through the glass taxes on the back lot not a good melon  too early for melons hairdresser in town found god closes shop every tuesday mice in the teatowel drawer again little pellets chew off  the corners of the napkins if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays rain tonight  rain tomorrow that volcano in the philippines at it again what’s her name anderson died no not shirley  the opera singer negress cancer not eating your garnish you don’t like pimento  out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a depression the ice has begun to unclench black open water comes  curdling up like anger my mother speaks suddenly that psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it you aren’t getting over him  my mother has a way of summing things up she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life  well he’s a taker and you’re a giver i hope it works out was all she said after she met him give and take were just words to me  at the time i had not been in love before it was like a wheel rolling downhill but early this morning while mother slept  and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in come in to the ghost of his heart’s darling  i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too she knows how to hang puppies that emily  it isn’t like taking an aspirin you know i answer feebly dr haw says grief is a long process she frowns what does it accomplish  all that raking up the past ohi spread my hands i prevail i look her in the eye she grins yes you do   whacher  whacher emily’s habitual spelling of this word has caused confusion for example  in the first line of the poem printed tell me whether is it winter in the shakespeare head edition but whacher is what she wrote  whacher is what she was she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night she whached eyes stars inside outside actual weather  she whached the bars of time which broke she whached the poor core of the world wide open  to be a whacher is not a choice there is nowhere to get away from it no ledge to climb up tolike a swimmer  who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off it just flies open to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy  although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel grazing with euphemism the work of whaching  but it has no name it is transparent sometimes she calls it thou  “emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet” records charlotte in 1828 unsociable even at home  and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers  this sad stunted life says one uninteresting unremarkable wracked by disappointment and despair says another  she could have been a great navigator if she’d been male suggests a third meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question  why cast the world away for someone hooked up to thou the world may have seemed a kind of halffinished sentence  but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face “lit up by a divine light”  and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life is a space where the little raw soul  slips through it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel out of sight  the little raw soul was caught by no one she didn’t have friends children sex religion marriage success a salary or a fear of death she worked  in total six months of her life at a school in halifax and died on the sofa at home at 2 pm on a winter afternoon in her thirtyfirst year she spent  most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet walking the moor or whaching she says  it gave her peace “all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day 4 years” she wrote in her diary paper of 1837  yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons vaults cages bars curbs bits bolts fetters locked windows narrow frames aching walls  “why all the fuss” asks one critic “she wanted liberty well didn’t she have it a reasonably satisfactory homelife  a most satisfactory dreamlifewhy all this beating of wings what was this cage invisible to us which she felt herself to be confined in”  well there are many ways of being held prisoner i am thinking as i stride over the moor as a rule after lunch mother has a nap  and i go out to walk the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light  something inside it reminds me of childhood it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick  and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering  something they never tell you remember too much my mother said to me recently  why hold onto all that and i said where can i put it down she shifted to a question about airports  crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun  on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else  perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days it is as if i could dip my hand down  into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country  i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotapehere we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house shadows  of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips  law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room  and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying you beauty i can feel that beauty’s  heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room no i say aloud i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water  and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood i stop and turn and stand into the wind  which now plunges towards me over the moor when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die this is not uncommon  i took up the practice of meditation each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers  de profundis clamavi ad te domine each morning a vision came to me gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul  i called them nudes nude 1 woman alone on a hill she stands into the wind  it is a hard wind slanting from the north long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift and blow away on the wind leaving  an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth it pains me to record this  i am not a melodramatic person but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights  charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte  talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emily’s workshopabout the inexorable spirit “stronger than a man simpler than a child”  the cruel illness “pain no words can render” the autonomous end “she sank rapidly she made haste to leave us” and about emily’s total subjection  to a creative project she could neither understand nor control and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth  “to breathe lightning” the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning  and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there  but emily is not responsible emily was in the grip “having formed these beings she did not know what she had done” says charlotte of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine  well there are many ways of being held prisoner the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes “on herself she had no pity”  pitiless too are the heights which emily called wuthering because of their “bracing ventilation” and “a north wind over the edge”  whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her father’s house on every side formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit  taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another “my love for heathcliff” says catherine  “resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary” necessary i notice the sun has dimmed  and the afternoon air sharpening i turn and start to recross the moor towards home what are the imperatives  that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach  of one another when it hardens what kind of necessity is that the last time i saw law was a black night in september autumn had begun  my knees were cold inside my clothes a chill fragment of moon rose he stood in my living room and spoke  without looking at me not enough spin on it he said of our five years of love inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces  which floated apart by now i was so cold it was like burning i put out my hand to touch his he moved back  i don’t want to be sexual with you he said everything gets crazy but now he was looking at me yes i said as i began to remove my clothes  everything gets crazy when nude i turned my back because he likes the back he moved onto me  everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself  thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me there was no area of my mind  not appalled by this action no part of my body that could have done otherwise but to talk of mind and body begs the question  soul is the place stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind where such necessity grinds itself out  soul is what i kept watch on all that night law stayed with me we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time  caressing and singing to one another in our madeup language like the children we used to be that was a night that centred heaven and hell  as emily would say we tried to fuck but he remained limp although happy i came again and again each time accumulating lucidity  until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries  visible around them like lines on a map i saw the lines harden he left in the morning  it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away   kitchen  kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in no sound from the rest of the house i wait a moment then open the fridge  brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed after extracting the yogurt container  from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door bluish dusk  fills the room like a sea slid back i lean against the sink white foods taste best to me  and i prefer to eat alone i don’t know why once i heard girls singing a may day song that went  violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone  girls are cruelest to themselves someone like emily brontë who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman  had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet  reason with him and then whip him was her instruction age six to her father regarding brother branwell  and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode they say into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm  cauterization of heathcliff took longer more than thirty years in the time of the novel from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor  because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s “it would degrade me to marry heathcliff” until the wild morning  when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights heathcliff is a pain devil  if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence “so he will never know how i love him”  heathcliff would have been set free but emily knew how to catch a devil she put into him in place of a soul  the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought she broke all his moments in half  with the kitchen door standing open i am not unfamiliar with this halflife but there is more to it than that  heathcliff’s sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë so far as we know her question  which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen “kichin” in emily’s spelling where she  and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet there is a fragment  of a poem she wrote in 1839 about six years before wuthering heights that says  that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky  who is the iron man my mother’s voice cuts across me from the next room where she is lying on the sofa  is that you dear yes ma why don’t you turn on a light in there  out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky okay ma what’s for supper   liberty  liberty means different things to different people i have never liked lying in bed in the morning law did my mother does  but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake  i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free  out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky frozen mud crunches underfoot the sound  startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s  arms like a needle in waterit is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hipsi  turn and face into the wind and begin to run goblins devils and death stream behind me  in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life i had no home in goodness anymore  to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible  perhaps this is what people mean by original sin i thought but what love could be prior to it what is prior  what is love my questions were not original nor did i answer them  mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul not the complex mysteries of love and hate  but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight there were in all thirteen of them  nude 2 woman caught in a cage of thorns big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way  unable to stand upright nude 3 woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead she grips it in both hands  endeavouring to wrench it out nude 4 woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch  covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater  she works hard at dislodging the crab it was about this time i began telling dr haw  about the nudes she said when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them why keep watching why not  go away i was amazed go away where i said this still seems to me a good question  but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk i have reached the middle  where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water it is frozen a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes  certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air each trunk  where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures thousands of hairthin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face  catching grins through the bars emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says  a messenger of hope comes every night to me and offers for short life eternal liberty  i wonder what kind of liberty this is her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death  they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter by nineteenthcentury life in a remote parish on a cold moor  in the north of england they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life “in so much of brontë’s work  the selfdramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama” says one another  refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question  why keep watching some people watch that’s all i can say there is nowhere else to go  no ledge to climb up to perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment as with a very difficult sister  “on that mind time and experience alone could work to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable” wrote charlotte of emily  i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage “my sister emily  was not a person of demonstrative character” charlotte emphasizes “nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could  with impunity intrude unlicensed   ” recesses were many one autumn day in 1845 charlotte “accidentally lighted on a ms volume of verse in my sister emily’s handwriting”  it was a small 4 x 6 notebook with a dark red cover marked 6d and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand  charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt “more than surprise” at its quality “not at all like the poetry women generally write”  further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel not least for its foul language she gently probes this recess  in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights “a large class of readers likewise will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work  of words printed with all their letters which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter onlya blank line filling the interval”  well there are different definitions of liberty love is freedom law was fond of saying i took this to be more a wish than a thought  and changed the subject but blank lines do not say nothing as charlotte puts it  “the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse strikes me as a proceeding which  however well meant is weak and futile i cannot tell what good it doeswhat feeling it spares what horror it conceals”  i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast it is a twoway traffic  the language of the unsaid my favourite pages of the collected works of emily brontë are the notes at the back  recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emily’s verse which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death “prison for strongestin emily’s hand altered to lordly by charlotte”   hero  i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not  not she puts her toast down on the side of her plate you know you can pull the drapes in that room she begins   this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments from what i call the rules of life series my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night  i open mine as wide as possible i like to see everything i say what’s there to see  moon air sunrise all that light on your face in the morning wakes you up i like to wake up  at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel  the stubborn as your father channel and random channel more toast i interpose strongly pushing back my chair  those women says my mother with an exasperated rasp mother has chosen random channel women  complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper lying beside the grape jam  the front page has a small feature about a rally for international women’s day have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue  nope why it’s a disgrace those bathing suits cut way up to here she points no wonder  you’re saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have highcut legs ma are you serious  well someone has to be responsible why should women be responsible for male desire my voice is high oh i see you’re one of them  one of whom my voice is very high mother vaults it and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one it looked so smart on you  the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid she will be eighty years old this summer  her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around  so ma we’ll goi pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate visit dad today she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility  leave at eleven home again by four i continue she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes silence is assent in our code i go into the next room to phone the taxi  my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about 50 miles from here he suffers from a kind of dementia  characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer first the presence in cerebral tissue  of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells second neurofibrillary snarlings  in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus there is no known cause or cure mother visits him by taxi once a week  for the last five years marriage is for better or for worse she says this is the worse  so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town the april light is clear as an alarm  as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow i wish i could carry this clarity with me  into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy these are my two wishes  it is hard to find the beginning of dementia i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone  it was a sunday night in winter i heard his sentences filling up with fear he would start a sentenceabout weather lose his way start another it made me furious to hear him floundering  my tall proud father former world war ii navigator it made me merciless i stood on the edge of the conversation  watching him thrash about for cues offering none and it came to me like a slow avalanche  that he had no idea who he was talking to much colder today i guess    his voice pressed into the silence and broke off  snow falling on it there was a long pause while snow covered us both well i won’t keep you  he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land i’ll say goodnight now i won’t run up your bill goodbye  goodbye goodbye who are you i said into the dial tone  at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock 5253  to the west wing for chronic care patients each wing has a name the chronic wing is our golden mile  although mother prefers to call it the last lap father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles  my father tilts least i am proud of him hi dad how y’doing his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage  and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air my mother lays her hand on his hello love she says he jerks his hand away we sit  sunlight flocks through the room mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him grapes arrowroot biscuits humbugs  he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us he uses a language known only to himself made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals  once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash you don’t say or happy birthday to you but no real sentence  for more than three years now i notice his front teeth are getting black i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people  he always took good care of his teeth my mother looks up she and i often think two halves of one thought do you remember that goldplated toothpick  you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london she asks yes i wonder what happened to it must be in the bathroom somewhere  she is giving him grapes one by one they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers he used to be a big man over six feet tall and strong  but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house except the hands the hands keep growing each one now as big as a boot in van gogh  they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high notehe waits  staring into my face that quizzical look one eyebrow at an angle i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home  it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane hands firmly behind backs legs wide apart chins forward  dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942  it is dawn they are leaving dover for france my father on the far left is the tallest airman  with his collar up one eyebrow at an angle the shadowless light makes him look immortal  for all the world like someone who will not weep again he is still staring into my face flaps down i cry his black grin flares once and goes out like a match   hot  hot blue moonlight down the steep sky i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark fumbling  and slowly consciousness replaces the bars dreamtails and angry liquids  swim back down to the middle of me it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now this is not uncommon after loss of love  blue and black and red blasting the crater open i am interested in anger i clamber along to find the source  my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires each wire has a little black switch  one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger  then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit  and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creaturesnot quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws  under a load of time i want to be beautiful again she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily  as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound comes my pajamas are soaked  anger travels through me pushes aside everything else in my heart pouring up the vents every night i wake to this anger  the soaked bed the hot pain box slamming me each way i move i want justice slam  i want an explanation slam i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever slam i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp night springs  out the window and is gone over the moor i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses  emily brontë was good at cursing falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse  well thou halt paid me back my love but if there be a god above whose arm is strong whose word is true this hell shall wring thy spirit too  the curses are elaborate  there go deceiver go my hand is streaming wet my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessingto forget oh could that lost heart give back back again to thine one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline  but they do not bring her peace  vain words vain frenzied thoughts no ear can hear me call lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall     unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still life bows to my control but love i cannot kill  her anger is a puzzle it raises many questions in me to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt  by someone who rarely left home “except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” charlotte tells us and who  had no more intercourse with haworth folk than “a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates”  how did emily come to lose faith in humans she admired their dialects studied their genealogies “but with them she rarely exchanged a word”  her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith among her biographers  is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her sixmonth stay in halifax but there is no evidence at all for such an event  and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 years banal sexism aside i find myself tempted  to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation  as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women it is a chilly thought  the heart is dead since infancy unwept for let the body go  suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin the vocation of anger is not mine i know my source  it is stunning it is a moment like no other when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore i switch off the lamp and lie on my back  thinking about emily’s cold young soul where does unbelief begin when i was young  there were degrees of certainty i could say yes i know that i have two hands then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear  from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky  our guests are darkly lodged i whispered gazing through the vault      thou  the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness and i prefer to put it off it is morning  astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east i am walking into the light one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god  emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power  thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind thou and emily influence one another in the darkness playing near and far at once  she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one” i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet there is no question  it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night without the terrible sex price to pay this is a childish idea i know  my education i have to admit has been gappy the basic rules of malefemale relations were imparted atmospherically in our family  no direct speech allowed i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car father in front  we were waiting in the driveway for mother who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car  dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels father glanced sideways at her showing a good bit of leg today mother he said  in a voice which i age eleven thought odd i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say her answer would clear this up  but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs  she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men  she was saying laugh not ropes thorns i have arrived at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a low swampy place the swamp water is frozen solid bits of gold weed  have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages  i’ll come when thou art saddest laid alone in the darkened room when the mad day’s mirth has vanished and the smile of joy is banished  i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling has entire unbiased sway and my influence o’er thee stealing grief deepening joy congealing shall bear thy soul away  listen ’tis just the hour the awful time for thee dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll forerunners of a sterner power heralds of me  very hard to read the messages that pass between thou and emily in this poem she reverses their roles  speaking not as the victim but to the victim it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered  it is a shock to realize that this low slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale  for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power  but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass which is her true creation  those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn it is who i am  is it a vocation of anger why construe silence as the real presence  why stoop to kiss this doorstep why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul  emily was fond of psalm 130 “my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning”  i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter  that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire ”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns“ says the psalmist  but for myself i do not believe this i am not quenched with thou or without thou i find no shelter i am my own nude  and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now  from love to anger to this cold marrow from fire to shelter to fire what is the opposite of believing in thou  merely not believing in thou no that is too simple that is to prepare a misunderstanding i want to speak more clearly  perhaps the nudes are the best way nude 5 deck of cards each card is made of flesh  the living cards are days of a woman’s life i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end nude 6 i cannot remember  nude 7 white room whose walls having neither planes nor curves nor angles are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane  like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon it is a living surface almost wet lucency breathes in and out  rainbows shudder across it and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering be very careful be very careful  nude 8 black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row a woman stands on the disc  amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her nude 9 transparent loam  under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench into the trench she is placing small white forms i don’t know what they are nude 10 green thorn of the world poking up  alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground the thorn is exploding  its green blood above her in the air everything it is it has the voice says nude 11 ledge in outer space  space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions shrieking past the woman who stands pinned  to nothing by its pressure she peers and glances for some way to go trying to lift her hand but cannot nude 12 old pole in the wind  cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines  some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole i cannot see how they are attached  notches staples nails all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots  then untie and float down the wind is gone it waits  by this time midway through winter i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama then it stopped  days passed months passed and i saw nothing i continued to peer and glance sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning  with my nerves open to the air like something skinned i saw nothing outside the window spring storms came and went  april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought  how slow as it glided soundlessly past but stillnothing no nudes no thou  a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle hoping to trick myself into some interior vision  but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing  i stopped watching i forgot about nudes i lived my life  which felt like a switchedoff tv something had gone through me and out and i could not own it “no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind  emily does not feel them” wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister emily had shaken free  a soul can do that whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings  you and i will never know but i can tell you what i saw nude 13 arrived when i was not watching for it it came at night  very much like nude 1 and yet utterly different i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air  it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached but as i came closer i saw it was a human body  trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones and there was no pain the wind  was cleansing the bones they stood forth silver and necessary it was not my body not a woman’s body it was the body of us all it walked out of the light

 from the kindness of my parents i suppose it was that i held that belief about suffering  imagining that if only it could come to the attention of any person with normal feelings certainly anyone literate who might have gone  to college they would comprehend pain when it went on before them and would do something about it whenever they saw it happen in the time of pain the present they would try to stop the bleeding for example with their own hands  but it escapes their attention or there may be reasons for it the victims under the blankets the meat counters the maimed children the animals the animals staring from the end of the world

 there are two memories of tides one for the deep blackness that split away from the mother sea and one for sea that found itself in the daybreaks of rivers yet it was all one sea tracked by comets and the elegant tern seals in speckled podshaped skins and whales opening their small eyes when the hands of people drew fish out of the salt  geologists tell us that the sea split millions of years ago before the yoemem yoremem kunkaak ootam curled their tongues around the names of themselves and raised the conch shell to their lips so that the sound of nature became human too  kalifornia vaawe  then the sea was measured and divided into leagues the spanish ships called it dangerous because the sea tore in two ways tide and rivers so they contained it in maps written on dead animal skins with ink made from dried octopus blood  mar de la kalifornia golfo de california

 i hear the halting footsteps of a lass in negro harlem when the night lets fall its veil i see the shapes of girls who pass to bend and barter at desires call ah little dark girls who in slippered feet go prowling through the night from street to street  through the long night until the silver break of day the little gray feet know no rest through the lone night until the last snowflake has dropped from heaven upon the earths white breast the dusky halfclad girls of tired feet are trudging thinly shod from street to street  ah stern harsh world that in the wretched way of poverty dishonor and disgrace has pushed the timid little feet of clay the sacred brown feet of my fallen race ah heart of me the weary weary feet in harlem wandering from street to street

 the heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn as a lone bird soft winging so restlessly on afar o’er life’s turrets and vales does it roam in the wake of those echoes the heart calls home  the heart of a woman falls back with the night and enters some alien cage in its plight and tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars while it breaks breaks breaks on the sheltering bars

the lad “all pity for me has gone out of the world” “your sister too is dead” “the mild sun rests on every ditch” he said “a sister loves even though not loved” “suibhne your daughter is dead” “and an only daughter is the needle of the heart” “and suibhne your little boy who used to call you “daddy”he is dead” “aye” said suibhne “that’s the drop that brings a man to the ground” he fell out of the yew tree loingseachan closed his arms around him and placed him in manacles after the middleirish romance the madness of suibhne 1 child of my winter born when the new fallen soldiers froze in asia’s steep ravines and fouled the snows when i was torn   by love i could not still by fear that silenced my cramped mind to that cold war where lost i could not find my peace in my will  all those days we could keep your mind a landscape of new snow where the chilled tenantfarmer finds below his fields asleep  in their smooth covering white as quilts to warm the resting bed of birth or pain spotless as paper spread for me to write  and thinks here lies my land unmarked by agony the lean foot of the weasel tracking the thick trapper’s boot and i have planned  my chances to restrain the torments of demented summer or increase the deepening harvest here before it snows again  2 late april and you are three today we dug your garden in the yard to curb the damage of your play strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling four slender sticks of lath stand guard uplifting their thin string  so you were the first to tramp it down and after the earth was sifted close you brought your watering can to drown all earth and us but these mixed seeds are pressed with light loam in their steadfast rows child we’ve done our best  someone will have to weed and spread the young sprouts sprinkle them in the hour when shadow falls across their bed you should try to look at them every day because when they come to full flower i will be away  3 the child between them on the street comes to a puddle lifts his feet and hangs on their hands they start at the live weight and lurch together recoil to swing him through the weather stiffen and pull apart  we read of cold war soldiers that never gained ground gave none but sat tight in their chill trenches pain seeps up from some cavity through the ranked teeth in sympathy the whole jaw grinds and clenches  till something somewhere has to give it’s better the poor soldiers live in someone else’s hands than drop where helpless powers fall on crops and barns on towns where all will burn and no man stands  for good they sever and divide their won and lost land on each side prisoners are returned excepting a few unknown names the peasant plods back and reclaims his fields that strangers burned  and nobody seems very pleased it’s best still what must not be seized clenches the empty fist i tugged your hand once when i hated things less a mere game dislocated the radius of your wrist  love’s wishbone child although i’ve gone as men must and let you be drawn off to appease another it may help that a chinese play or solomon himself might say i am your real mother  4 no one can tell you why the season will not wait the night i told you i must leave you wept a fearful rate to stay up late  now that it’s turning fall we go to take our walk among municipal flowers to steal one off its stalk to try and talk  we huff like windy giants scattering with our breath grayheaded dandelions spring is the cold winds aftermath the poet saith  but the asters too are gray ghostgray last night’s cold is sending on their way petunias and dwarf marigold hunched sick and old  like nerves caught in a graph the morningglory vines frost has erased by half still scrawl across their rigid twines like broken lines  of verses i can’t make in its unraveling loom we find a flower to take with some late buds that might still bloom back to your room  night comes and the stiff dew i’m told a friend’s child cried because a cricket who had minstreled every night outside her window died  5 winter again and it is snowing although you are still three you are already growing strange to me  you chatter about new playmates sing strange songs you do not know hey dingadingading or where i go  or when i sang for bedtimefox went out on a chilly night before i went for walks and did not write  you never mind the squalls and storms that are renewed long since outside the thick snow swarms into my prints  and swirls out by warehouses sealed dark cowbarns huddled still beyond to the blank field the fox’s hill  where he backtracks and sees the paw gnawed off he cannot feel conceded to the jaw of toothed blue steel  6 easter has come around again the river is rising over the thawed ground and the banksides when you come you bring an egg dyed lavender we shout along our bank to hear our voices returning from the hills to meet us we need the landscape to repeat us  you lived on this bank first while nine months filled your term we knew how your lungs immersed in the womb miraculously grew their useless folds till the fierce cold air rushed in to fill them out like bushes thick with leaves you took your hour caught breath and cried with your full lung power  over the stagnant bight we see the hungry bank swallow flaunting his free flight still we sink in mud to follow the killdeer from the grass that hides her nest that march there was rain the rivers rose you could hear killdeers flying all night over the mudflats crying  you bring back how the red winged blackbird shrieked slapping frail wings diving at my head i saw where her tough nest cradled swings in tall reeds that must sway with the winds blowing every way if you recall much you recall this place you still live nearbyon the opposite hill  after the sharp windstorm of july fourth all that summer through the gentle warm afternoons we heard great chain saws chirr like iron locusts crews of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose branches wrenched in the shattering wind to hack free all the torn limbs that could sap the tree  in the debris lay starlings dead near the park’s birdrun we surprised one day a proud tanspatted buffbrown pigeon in my hands she flapped so fearfully that i let her go her keeper came and we helped snarl her in a net you bring things i’d as soon forget  you raise into my head a fall night that i came once more to sit on your bed sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore head and you wheezed for breath for help like some child caught beneath its comfortable woolly blankets drowning there your lungs caught and would not take the air  of all things only we have power to choose that we should die nothing else is free in this world to refuse it yet i who say this could not raise myself from bed how many days to the thieving world child i have another wife another child we try to choose our life  7 here in the scuffled dust is our ground of play i lift you on your swing and must shove you away see you return again drive you off again then  stand quiet till you come you though you climb higher farther from me longer will fall back to me stronger bad penny pendulum you keep my constant time  to bob in blue july where fat goldfinches fly over the glittering fecund reach of our growing lands once more now this second i hold you in my hands  8 i thumped on you the best i could which was no use you would not tolerate your food until the sweet fresh milk was soured with lemon juice  that puffed you up like a fine yeast the first june in your yard like some squat nero at a feast you sat and chewed on white sweet clover that is over  when you were old enough to walk we went to feed the rabbits in the park milkweed saw the paired monkeys under lock consume each others salt  going home we watched the slow stars follow us down heaven’s vault you said let’s catch one that comes low pull off its skin and cook it for our dinner  as absentee breadwinner i seldom got you such cuisine we ate in local restaurants or bought what lunches we could pack in a brown sack  with stale dry bread to toss for ducks on the greenscummed lagoons crackers for porcupine and fox lifesavers for the footpad coons to scour and rinse  snatch after in their muddy pail  and stare into their paws when i moved next door to the jail i learned to fry omelettes and griddlecakes so i  could set you supper at my table as i built back from helplessness when i grew able the only possible answer was you had to come here less  this hallowe’en you come one week you masquerade as a vermilion sleek fat crosseyed fox in the parade or where grim jackolanterns leer  go with your bag from door to door foraging for treats how queer when you take off your mask my neighbors must forget and ask whose child you are  of course you lose your appetite whine and won’t touch your plate as local law i set your place on an orange crate in your own room for days at night  you lie asleep there on the bed and grate your jaw assuredly your father’s crimes are visited on you you visit me sometimes  the time’s up now our pumpkin sees me bringing your suitcase he holds his grin the forehead shrivels sinking in you break this year’s first crust of snow  off the runningboard to eat we manage though for days i crave sweets when you leave and know they rot my teeth indeed our sweet foods leave us cavities  9 i get numb and go in though the dry ground will not hold the few dry swirls of snow and it must not be very cold a friend asks how you’ve been and i don’t know  or see much right to ask or what use it could be to know in three months since you came the leaves have fallen and the snow your pictures pinned above my desk seem much the same  somehow i come to find myself upstairs in the third floor museum’s halls walking to kill my time once more among the enduring and resigned stuffed animals  where through a century’s caprice displacement and known treachery between its wars they hear some old command and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze to this still scene  nature morte here by the door its guardian the patchwork dodo stands where you and your stepsister ran laughing and pointing here last year you pulled my hands  and had your first worst quarrel so toys were put up on your shelves here in the first glass cage the little bobcats arch themselves still practicing their snarl of constant rage  the bison here immense shoves at his calf brow to brow and looks it in the eye to see what is it thinking now i forced you to obedience i don’t know why  still the lean lioness beyond them on her jutting ledge of shale and desert shrub stands watching always at the edge stands hard and tanned and envious above her cub  with horns locked in tall heather two great olympian elk stand bound fixed in their lasting hate till hunger brings them both to ground whom equal weakness binds together none shall separate  yet separate in the ocean of broken ice the white bear reels beyond the leathery groups of scattered drab arctic seals arrested here in violent motion like napoleon’s troops  our states have stood so long at war shaken with hate and dread they are paralyzed at bay once we were out of reach we said we would grow reasonable and strong some other day  like the cold men of rome we have won costly fields to sow in salt our only seed nothing but injury will grow i write you only the bitter poems that you can’t read  onan who would not breed a child to take his brother’s bread and be his brother’s birth rose up and left his lawful bed went out and spilled his seed in the cold earth  i stand by the unborn by puttycolored children curled in jars of alcohol that waken to no other world unchanging where no eye shall mourn i see the caul  that wrapped a kitten dead i see the branching doubled throat of a twoheaded foal i see the hydrocephalic goat here is the curled and swollen head there the burst skull  skin of a limbless calf a horse’s foetus mummified mounted and joined forever the siamese twin dogs that ride belly to belly half and half that none shall sever  i walk among the growths by gangrenous tissue goiter cysts by fistulas and cancers where the malignancy man loathes is held suspended and persists and i don’t know the answers  the window’s turning white the world moves like a diseased heart packed with ice and snow three months now we have been apart less than a mile i cannot fight or let you go  10 the vicious winter finally yields the green winter wheat the farmer tired in the tired fields he dare not leave will eat  once more the runs come fresh prevailing piglets stout as jugs harry their old sow to the railing to ease her swollen dugs  and game colts trail the herded mares that circle the pasture courses our seasons bring us back once more like merrygoround horses  with crocus mouths perennial hungers into the park spring comes we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers and feed the swan bread crumbs  pay our respects to the peacocks rabbits and leathery canada goose who took last fall our tame white habits and now will not turn loose  in full regalia the pheasant cocks march past their dubious hens the porcupine and the lean red fox trot around bachelor pens  and the miniature painted train wails on its oval track you said i’m going to pennsylvania and waved and you’ve come back  if i loved you they said i’d leave and find my own affairs well once again this april we’ve come around to the bears  punished and cared for behind bars the coons on bread and water stretch thin black fingers after ours and you are still my daughter

 first there was some other order of things never spoken but in dreams of darkest creation  then there was black earth lake the face of light on water then the thick forest all around that light and then the human clay whose blood we still carry rose up in us who remember caves with red bison painted in their own blood after their kind  a wildness swam inside our mothers desire through closed eyes a new child wearing the red wet mask of birth delivered into this land already wounded stolen and burned beyond reckoning  red is this yielding land turned inside out by a country of hunters with iron flint and fire red is the fear that turns a knife back against men holds it at their throats and they cannot see the claw on the handle the animal hand that haunts them from some place inside their blood  so that is hunting birth and one kind of death then there was medicine the healing of wounds red was the infinite fruit of stolen bodies the doctors wanted to know what invented disease how wounds healed from inside themselves how life stands up in skin if not by magic  they divined the red shadows of leeches that swam in white bowls of water they believed stars in the cup of sky they cut the wall of skin to let what was bad escape but they were reading the story of fire gone out and that was a science  as for the animal hand on death’s knife knives have as many sides as the red father of war who signs his name in the blood of other men  and red was the soldier who crawled through a ditch of human blood in order to live it was the canal of his deliverance it is his son who lives near me red is the thunder in our ears when we meet love like creation is some other order of things  red is the share of fire i have stolen from root hoof fallen fruit and this was hunger  red is the human house i come back to at night swimming inside the cave of skin that remembers bison in that round nation of blood we are all burning red inseparable fires the living have crawled and climbed through in order to live so nothing will be left for death at the end  this life in the fire i love it i want it this life

 excerpt book i  deep in the shady sadness of a vale far sunken from the healthy breath of morn far from the fiery noon and eves one star sat grayhaird saturn quiet as a stone still as the silence round about his lair forest on forest hung about his head like cloud on cloud no stir of air was there not so much life as on a summers day robs not one light seed from the featherd grass but where the dead leaf fell there did it rest a stream went voiceless by still deadened more by reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade the naiad mid her reeds pressd her cold finger closer to her lips  along the marginsand large footmarks went no further than to where his feet had strayd and slept there since upon the sodden ground his old right hand lay nerveless listless dead unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed while his bowd head seemd listning to the earth his ancient mother for some comfort yet  it seemd no force could wake him from his place but there came one who with a kindred hand touchd his wide shoulders after bending low with reverence though to one who knew it not she was a goddess of the infant world by her in stature the tall amazon had stood a pigmys height she would have taen achilles by the hair and bent his neck or with a finger stayd ixions wheel her face was large as that of memphian sphinx pedestald haply in a palace court when sages lookd to egypt for their lore but oh how unlike marble was that face how beautiful if sorrow had not made sorrow more beautiful than beautys self there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up one hand she pressd upon that aching spot where beats the human heart as if just there though an immortal she felt cruel pain the other upon saturns bended neck she laid and to the level of his ear leaning with parted lips some words she spake in solemn tenour and deep organ tone some mourning words which in our feeble tongue would come in these like accents o how frail to that large utterance of the early gods saturn look upthough wherefore poor old king i have no comfort for thee no not one i cannot say o wherefore sleepest thou for heaven is parted from thee and the earth knows thee not thus afflicted for a god and ocean too with all its solemn noise has from thy sceptre passd and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty thy thunder conscious of the new command rumbles reluctant oer our fallen house and thy sharp lightning in unpractisd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain o aching time o moments big as years all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe saturn sleep ono thoughtless why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude why should i ope thy melancholy eyes saturn sleep on while at thy feet i weep  as when upon a tranced summernight those greenrobd senators of mighty woods tall oaks branchcharmed by the earnest stars dream and so dream all night without a stir save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence and dies off as if the ebbing air had but one wave so came these words and went the while in tears she touchd her fair large forehead to the ground just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturns feet one moon with alteration slow had shed her silver seasons four upon the night and still these two were postured motionless like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern the frozen god still couchant on the earth and the sad goddess weeping at his feet until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone and all the gloom and sorrow of the place and that fair kneeling goddess and then spake as with a palsied tongue and while his beard shook horrid with such aspenmalady o tender spouse of gold hyperion thea i feel thee ere i see thy face look up and let me see our doom in it look up and tell me if this feeble shape is saturns tell me if thou hearst the voice of saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow naked and bare of its great diadem peers like the front of saturn who had power to make me desolate whence came the strength how was it nurturd to such bursting forth while fate seemd strangled in my nervous grasp but it is so and i am smotherd up and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale of admonitions to the winds and seas of peaceful sway above mans harvesting and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love ini am gone away from my own bosom i have left my strong identity my real self somewhere between the throne and where i sit here on this spot of earth search thea search open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round upon all space space starrd and lorn of light space regiond with lifeair and barren void spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell search thea search and tell me if thou seest a certain shape or shadow making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile it mustit must be of ripe progresssaturn must be king yes there must be a golden victory there must be gods thrown down and trumpets blown of triumph calm and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan voices of soft proclaim and silver stir of strings in hollow shells and there shall be beautiful things made new for the surprise of the skychildren i will give command thea thea thea where is saturn  this passion lifted him upon his feet and made his hands to struggle in the air his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat his eyes to fever out his voice to cease he stood and heard not theas sobbing deep a little time and then again he snatchd utterance thusbut cannot i create cannot i form cannot i fashion forth another world another universe to overbear and crumble this to nought where is another chaos wherethat word found way unto olympus and made quake the rebel threethea was startled up and in her bearing was a sort of hope as thus she quickvoicd spake yet full of awe this cheers our fallen house come to our friends o saturn come away and give them heart i know the covert from thence came i hither thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space he followd and she turnd to lead the way through aged boughs that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest  meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed more sorrow like to this and such like woe too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe the titans fierce selfhid or prisonbound groand for the old allegiance once more and listend in sharp pain for saturns voice but one of the whole mammothbrood still kept his sovreignty and rule and majesty blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat still snuffd the incense teeming up from man to the suns god yet unsecure for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex so also shuddered he not at dogs howl or gloombirds hated screech or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell or prophesyings of the midnight lamp but horrors portiond to a giant nerve oft made hyperion ache his palace bright bastiond with pyramids of glowing gold and touchd with shade of bronzed obelisks glard a bloodred through all its thousand courts arches and domes and fiery galleries and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flushd angerly while sometimes eagles wings unseen before by gods or wondering men darkend the place and neighing steeds were heard not heard before by gods or wondering men also when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense breathd aloft from sacred hills instead of sweets his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick and so when harbourd in the sleepy west after the full completion of fair day for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody he pacd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal on from hall to hall while far within each aisle and deep recess his winged minions in close clusters stood amazd and full of fear like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers even now while saturn rousd from icy trance went step for step with thea through the woods hyperion leaving twilight in the rear came slope upon the threshold of the west then as was wont his palacedoor flew ope in smoothest silence save what solemn tubes blown by the serious zephyrs gave of sweet and wandering sounds slowbreathed melodies and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape in fragrance soft and coolness to the eye that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown for the god to enter in  he enterd but he enterd full of wrath his flaming robes streamd out beyond his heels and gave a roar as if of earthly fire that scard away the meek ethereal hours and made their dovewings tremble on he flared from stately nave to nave from vault to vault through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light and diamondpaved lustrous long arcades until he reachd the great main cupola there standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot and from the basements deep to the high towers jarrd his own golden region and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceasd his voice leapt out despite of godlike curb to this result o dreams of day and night o monstrous forms o effigies of pain o spectres busy in a cold cold gloom o lankeard phantoms of blackweeded pools why do i know ye why have i seen ye why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new saturn is fallen am i too to fall am i to leave this haven of my rest this cradle of my glory this soft clime this calm luxuriance of blissful light these crystalline pavilions and pure fanes of all my lucent empire it is left deserted void nor any haunt of mine the blaze the splendour and the symmetry i cannot seebut darkness death and darkness even here into my centre of repose the shady visions come to domineer insult and blind and stifle up my pomp fallno by tellus and her briny robes over the fiery frontier of my realms i will advance a terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer rebel jove and bid old saturn take his throne again he spake and ceasd the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out hush so at hyperions words the phantoms pale bestirrd themselves thrice horrible and cold and from the mirrord level where he stood a mist arose as from a scummy marsh at this through all his bulk an agony crept gradual from the feet unto the crown like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way with head and neck convulsd from overstrained might releasd he fled to the eastern gates and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush he breathd fierce breath against the sleepy portals cleard them of heavy vapours burst them wide suddenly on the oceans chilly streams the planet orb of fire whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through spun round in sable curtaining of clouds nor therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid but ever and anon the glancing spheres circles and arcs and broadbelting colure glowd through and wrought upon the muffling dark sweetshaped lightnings

 in real life you are aging at the rate of a shortlived sitcom  and the only kind of loneliness worth laughing about is throwing out half a frozen meal for two  because leftovers are never funnier the next day  in real life there is no such thing as a gritty reboot  it’s just  fucking gritty all the time mate because your bestlaid plans are always someone else’s  chance to crash a car into the crowd at a men’s rights charity concert  in real life the nice guys pull out of the race  when their tires are slashed or they turn back because they think they left the iron on  and no one adheres to sports film clichés anyway  we’re all selfish and we want that trophy  in real life you’ll never make it out of your homophobic small town  alive so your left hand begs for water while your right hand swings an ax  your left foot drags a church bell while your right foot taps  sos sos sos

 part one   i   slippilings on the brooklyn littoral the poles still tarry flimsy the ferry terminus with its walledup doors wan doorshapes on eroded sills downstream the strutwork of the williamsburg cable tower threw its cool shadow half a mile inland over tarpaper seams gantried water butts and splintery tenement cornices milled with acanthus and classical grasses of nineteenthcentury dreamslum fantasy we could see from our rooftops the endspan floating its antthreads of traffic to the granite salients of the anchorage and through its strands on the west the financial district’s watery silhouettes  but it was our own foundations crumbling in the sandy soil that made us protest the drill rigs sounding for a wider bridge ramp to funnel the airport traffic over us into manhattan “construction tremors will weaken our buildings” from the overroosted tenements clinging near the anchorage flew manuscript lists of signatures blockgroups’ painfully englished petitions but city hall adoze sleepfeeding just flooded us   ii   with chimerical figures and blueprints wearing us down our own “blockleader” luz a guatemalan law student at nyu where i studied classics distracted us more easily with her “pure language” or antipuerto rican tirades “call that spanish take my sitter muy indio still speaks some maya mountainlanguage but the beautiful spanish” and so one evening this sitter pilar came overforty perhaps with a long fawntinted oval face and read in low tones an archaic poem to the madonna “my daughter knows it in quiché and english” and she passed around wistfully a first communion photoflat cheekbones like her mother’s long black braids straight look  luz told us pilar had lost husband and son to the violence a machinegunned death heap in the center of their village “they killed all the men but when my family came here she came with her girl we helped with the green card and she’s a hotel maid now near the un ” much realer this than our own bridgeinflicted someday disaster and who knew but our bridge might metamorphose as the city said “global cities draw capital” into a river of money “we’ll all sell cuchifritos on the ramp” and anyway mainly summer   iii   was running out with its open evenings and windows one saturday turning onto my block from the subway i heard my name crossed the street where twin buildings had areaways and saw you waving the same pilar from a window below the swagbellied area railings “come have some coffeego around in back” i walked down the buildingside and turned in a trashlittered airwell by a door with multiple doorbells you opened from a wooden hallway unpainted with padlocked doors “see the super’s cut up his flat for illegals they took out an inside wall so our room has a windowwe all share the bath” i entered a limewalled roomchairs and table sofabed your front wall was the building front the three others drywall on the bureau a blackshawled priedieu  two photos two candles in translucent whitewaxed sacks and a polychrome madonna with meeting brows  through your window car wheels railings and above my own secondstory windows “we saw you reading there” you said from behind me “when we moved in” you sat me on the sofa and formally presented your daughter she moved her schoolbooks all to one end near her a shallow linoleumedover trench and a bathroom sink you said “i’m a widow from the mountains near morache very near the hometown of señora luz my real work is hotel maid and i’ve got a nice job at a place called the tricontinental” then you paused and i felt how clearly you’d presented yourself as americans do with your job your état civil and i said “i’m a graduate student at nyu where luz studies no not married no children ” i tried to add something else at once to leave this less  definitive but nothing came so we ran through bridgerumors and soon we were hardly listening waiting for our own next word and laughing at our gabble pequita told us what the priest had said about the drilling you spoke of pequita’s first communion and none of us could stop finding striking things to say next day you came over to see my plants and i came back for soupsupper looking up at my windows which in the easy halfyellow light of autumn looked oddly beckoning as we ate you leaned forward with a sudden rogue’s smile and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge “there’s a path up there if the bridge is bad we’ll tell off the mayor” in what spirit i wondered had you listened to our committee and when i got home i looked down and through your sheer curtains saw you cleaning up and pequita at the table reading   iv   but next week instead of the plank stair that zigzags up the anchorageside we wandered the riverside shipping alleys from below we could see overhead the underarch of the bridge and feel the resonant topthrum of westbound subways and trucks then the riversidei loved this part a sort of postindustrial fenworld with tiny terrace houses big dredgerparts laid aside from the drillings and abandoned wreckers’ lots filled with seafloor light and trembling longawned panicles of switchgrass its timelessness soothed methough ephemeral even that day one freshly tuckpointed facade and a pair of brandnew bronze edwardian mermaid doorknockers i could see our quarter five years from now saythe withering discount chains tentative boutiques and mother and daughter figuring to the upscale “pioneers” as neighborhood indigenes living on with strange literalness among them supplying their justpermissible quantum of urban grit  you were ahead and pequita trailed us rattling weed stalks with a stray lath as we progressed in and out of the endspan’s slatted shadows you turned and called me into a sidelotsunken concrete flask green puddles to a brokenoff building wall it had been interior oncerows of soiled roomsized plaster squares trailing sawn pipes with one high trembling toilet like a pearl in a lower square fringed with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti was a mural muy latino the mountain dreaming the city a terrace cafe with palm trees and a dancer shawled in black lace with inwardangled castanets and you lifted yourself on tiptoe pilar to touch the lace as you might have grazed pequita’s cheek i felt a pang as if i already needed you sturdy inside your sturdy body not this gesture as if exiled within you reached out we stepped back museumwise to contemplate and you said “luz likes to say i’m some mountainwoman but when my mother died i lived with my aunt in the cityi only went back when i married” i told her i’d lived in this city with a stepmother who’d divorced my uncle to marry my father and beat me “a stepmother’s a curse of god” you said gently and on the walk back pointed out more wall palms beaches until new york seemed a dot in a belt of capitals high on the globe worldcities packed with immigrants refugees gastarbeiter a snowy latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia   v   we were a threesome coffee suppers tv pequita at my computeryou’d asked me to teach her or sleeping on my sofa one bad month they moved you to night shift yet only that summer i’d worked in my window like a scholar in a lamplit bay the night filled with myriad noises like roman juvenal to whose ears “came ever the sounds of buildings collapsing” across the two tenementfaces florid all bucrania meanders dusky trails of fireescape bedding and everything underlit by the sinister slowstopping car lights of our street  but now it was the dailiness of two from another hemisphere through snowfissures winds fluting on railings and buildingflaws pilar in her low frame paced with armfuls of laundry washed in the sink and hung to dry everywhere the thousand stratagems of those who simply must not spend and the tiny motherdecisions though you preferred periphery housekeeping around her you’d make yourself interrupt her to mop behind your sweeping and pequitai saw her wrap you up on the sofa when you had flu and bring you orange juice as they’d taught her in school for she loved you she was the person who loved you i saw too that of what i wanted the university to be for mea tiny model of the city with its own rules and subsets “tell me each day who i am”you’d found your part in pequita i followed the shape of your day touching center as it funneled into her hand and moving pencilpoint   vi   for everything seemed natural to pequita the credo her photocopied choir music piled beside the tidy priedieu  our neighborhood of syringefilled gutters drugstoops and pimps her school’s turkey cutouts metal detectors backedup toilets  our human wilderness halfurban halfsurreal to her was a matteroffact eden like the picturesque ruins and laughably rococo grottoes imagined  by the seicento as the golden age and i i thought her whole world it comes back touching as if her child’s paradisial will were there for my affectionate recreation like our still faithfully occasionally typedup and dispatched protests from the ramp committee to the mayor slight effects of perspective tiny human gestures giving point to the city’s vast ironic beauty   part two   vii   at a moment when no one was thinking about her pequita awoke perhaps she enjoyed the solitude pilar asleep me asleep across the street she got up and stood on the cheap oval bathroom rug before the sink at seven the drills started deepertoned than ever before they woke me and part of your ceiling fell in a beam splintered plummeting straight to the oval rug the person screaming over the phone was pilar i thought it must be really all right or she’d be crying not screaming but when i’d called 911 and run over pequita was barely alive  then the hospital corridors me trying to close my winter coat the buttons were off on my nightgown you on a bench staring straight ahead when they said pequita was “gone” you were utterly silent i brought you to my place though our street was a tangle of police lights and yellow tape terrified of your fixed inner focus as if you had a plan  next night i had luz stay over i slept at her place the third i was back you thank god i thought were crying and luz had set up the service she propelled us downstairs and to a tiny brick church i must often have passed without seeing it two blocks inland  eggblue inside it was with a little green and gilt altar dark stations on the walls and the statue of the virgin of guadeloupe placed oddly below the altar stairs so that pilar after the deathmass could kneel before her praying straight into her face while i on a kneeler buried mine in my hands what would the mother live for now the hotel me or luz already writing more endless mad letters yet only these had from the city real answers they’d brace the drill site with vibrationabsorbing piers and they wanted her and her friend mrs citrin to know “that no one else had been more than lightly injured”   viii   it was the end of winter very dark the building managers nervy had moved you to the first floor next door till you found a new place i knew you weren’t looking each day i saw you arrive from work answer my call tersely then pull down your blinds a shadow showed rarely flattened shapeless you lay on your sofa a lot “thanks annei’m better without company” or “please understand” but often later in the evening you’d come down the stairs and turn inland then one morning as i was passing with early groceries you were leaving the parish hall in your black winter coat heavily scarved and we paused approvingly you tapped one glove on my armloadyou’d told me to cook more dictated recipes i asked if this had been pequita’s choirpractice place the sentence wavered but you replied with grim joy “she’s not practicing now ” it took me a minute pequita was singing this moment in the presence  still what you felt most it was in your face was absence absence but from something bitter in your eyes that seemed small and round with the cold i felt your desire to exclude me and our old collusive ironies what were such luxuries now ironies anglo friends and i thought you hated my mind that remembered the brownpapered books the orange juice i reached to touch your armto get past this but no you had to get home “i fasted for communion” and your eyes swerved away all my laughable my lovely delusional studies that i’d seen you sort through for pequita were now an affront and yet i felt you moving behind your own mind as if with something held in reserve    ix   but then you stopped answering the phone went less often to church what i thought was that you were angry certainly i was perhaps i thought you needed to talk and i’d visit you in manhattan so one morning in march in the black coat i’d got for the funeral i walked east from the fortysecond street lexington stop to the threestory fairylit jungle atrium of the tricontinental and went to the seventh floor where you started there was a cart in the hall  a gleaming chrome maid’s cart halfprojecting from a bedroom on its sides were rows of glasses with lace sanibonnets gold stamped minisoaps and deodorants it moved out and you stood in the door with a sheetload looking fat in a starchy pink uniform monogrammed pilar when you saw me you dropped the sheets and in pain pressed both palms to your cheeks and looked at me looking at you when i started sobbing you took my shoulder and backed me to the elevator pressed the button stepped back and then to my surprise gave me a sudden hug before pushing me in   x   it had been always this halfconnected and tenuous our friendship what light on my own isolation and need that i hadn’t known but you actually called me that week to propose our old joke a bridge walkmaybe saturday your voice in my ears sounded wobbly with tension heldbackness so i got in first a friend had wound up her doctorate and left me a minute village studio starting june  after that i could listen somber as you poured out your need to leave luz’s cousin the possible hotel job “right in la” you added “anne” and broke off “well i’ll tell you that later look it may snow on saturday ok” “i don’t care” and before  you hung up i’d resigned you given you up we’d part on my side in anger on yours in oblivion i met you at the foot of the anchorage stair not the eastern approach with its easy grade near the ramp site we climbed through the snow slowly pausing at landings for different views of our old alley world like a museum of disused urban functionswe noted a brickedover backyard privy arch and from higher roofhuts inkily distinct of oldstyle tenement dumbwaiters the whole scene thrown out of drawing by one of those giant nyc cablespools charred at the bottom where some homeless had tried to burn it  the moist snow was sweeping through the cable tower when we clambered onto the path beneath it as we moved hunched slightly onto the mainspan the whole city abruptly whitedout to a monochrome geometry of vertical and stooping gray lines i thought how pequita would have loved it and caught her mother’s eye we went on cautiously soon pausing to stamp our boots and look over the rail at the traffic lanes below us “anne what i started to say beforethis is it i’m sorry i didn’t talk to youyou understand” “of course” i lied aimlessly but you glancing sideways “but i’m really sorry ” “no really ” you shook your head slightly then took my arm “okay then what’s this thing” pointing a snowy boot at a bolt as high as our knees with a rustedon octagonal nut “it’s just a bolt” you tapped your glove on a strut “strut” i provided and you said pompously in luz’ very intonations in what spirit had you listened“the tolerances just aren’t there ”  then feeling easier we started naming everything spikes spunwire vertical cables english spanish and then i heard you speak quiché words once for vines for split trunks over gorges but everything on the bridge was shabby neglectedlooking and you said soberly “if anyone was supposed to look after this bridge he’s forgot all about it” we didn’t link arms again but started back pausing to throw a few loose snowballs on the manhattan traffic below us we’d go our separate waysi’d go on delaying skirting around my burntout places you’d go where you could forget what you could some joblike relinquishment of inquiry or thought organisms tend to persist  when we got down to the massive base of the anchorage we managed a hug that took in our past at least one embrace of two black winter coats in the snow

 no matter if half the park is concrete and stanchions supporting a bridge  near industrial buildings yellow in the sun their stalks of smoke soaring awake  next to empty lots and bus stops without seats or signs or schedules  near houses bright with paint the color of dented cans of spam  men walking the streets to work look longingly towards their doors  no matter if all the murals decay and the statue of zapata falls  more months pile to be swept and years ironed folded and put away in drawers  and if jail bars bite off chunks of your view remember a wise gamblers words on craps  call for the dice back and between rolls wipe the dust off the dice as bills coil a foot  in the wind because life is a wild emotion lying in the grass soon to be green  not even bags of chips cheetahs with wind avoid being tackled gouged and ripped apart  we all eventually submit are arched over by a hyena grin and growl in the sun  soon the spots will show and the world will pull tight with relief as the jungle rallies around us as we smile now and cry later

 when i look at it it’s simple really i hated life there september once filled with animal deaths and toughened hay and the smells  of fall were boileddown beets and potatoes or the farmhands’ breeches smeared with oil and diesel  as they rode into town dusty and pissed the radio station split time between metal and tejano and the only action  happened on friday nights where the high school football team gave everyone a chance at forgiveness the town left no room  for novelty or change the sheriff knew everyone’s son and despite that we’d cruise up and down the avenues switching between  brake and gearshift we’d fight and spit chew into big gulp cups and have our hearts broken nightly in that town i learned  to fire a shotgun at nine and wring a chicken’s neck with one hand by twirling the bird and whipping it straight like a towel  but i loved the place once everything was blonde and cracked and the irrigation ditches stretched to the end of the earth you could  ride on a bicycle and see clearly the outline of every leaf or catch on the streets each word of a neighbor’s argument  nothing could happen there and if i willed it the place would have me slipping over its rocks into the river with the sugar plant’s steam  or signing papers at a storefront army desk buttoned up with medallions and a crew cut eyeing the next recruits  if i’ve learned anything it’s that i could be anywhere staring at a hunk of asphalt or listening to the clap of billiard balls  against each other in a bar and hear my name indifference now some i shook loose but that isn’t the whole story the fact is  i’m still in love and when i wake up i watch my son yawn and my mind turns his upswept hair into cornstalks  at the edge of a field stillness is an acre and his body idles deep like heavy machinery i want to take him back there  to the small town of my youth and hold the book of wildflowers open for him and look i want him to know the colors of horses  to run with a cattail in his hand and watch as its seeds fly weightless as though nothing mattered as though  the little things we tell ourselves about our pasts stay there rising slightly and just out of reach

 over the growing shadows fell the dead weight of  light  with a long bark mules metered the distance and turned back dust rose like columns of unpaid debt spit dried before it could reach the ground  then the thinbarked orange trees disowned their thickskinned fruit then mosquitoes spat out bad blood into the gutters and were gone  fish was opened like a twopage book its skeleton caught aflame like an asp inscribed with fire along the bone lines then slapped on a stone face of a plate next to a cocacola bottle as cold as hell  in the market fruit prices jumped up so high  the seller women turned into hawks  with a gibbous peacock brushing by their feet in the woods where each leaf  hides a face and each trunk a spine and each tree a crime where owls and angels  a man and three women were contesting an apple  the winner’s body itself was an apple with skin chewed off inside her breasts milk circled like a growling animal locked behind two heavy nipples  it was both day and night her moonwhite hand on the sungold fruit in her hair more stones than in a graveyard  so  i followed the woman as she ate hoping if not for a bite then at least a spit in my direction but she left nothing of that apple not even the memory of eating it  ever

 from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details even as children we noticed all people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny we were reassured our powers had been confirmed but that was a long while ago now we are 60 we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years it is a very suitable dwelling and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord we think he is pleased we notice his transparency we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations  after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus we are small women many people do not notice us while we are noticing them we keep to ourselves mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing mother knew a lot she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach  at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch we set the alarm at 2 and 6 this way we both get some sleep theres always something to see along this road even at 3 in the morning last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons tie them on her arms as if they were wings she climbed up a tree spread her arms and jumped we think she might have injured herself she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance we didnt want to get involved our slippers might have gotten wet it had been raining quite heavily  another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was we were able to read the words on his tattoos ‘dearest jean’ and ‘sailor boy’ we also saw a thin line thru the word ‘jean’ as if he had tried to cut the word out very interesting we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning it didnt take long  we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us then we can read them thru to recall the details they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy we put black velvet covers on these books they are so soft to stroke just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents  there are many folks with bad legs along this road they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world they bandage their legs in different ways some of the bandages are rather grubby you’d think theyd wash them there are plenty of laundromats around here every pension day they could wash them they could share a machine you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions – at least ten bandages dear me if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them they wouldnt be in this predicament we’re so pleased we’re not handicapped we have only ourselves to thank and of course mother  pension morning is always busy we always make sure the teapot is full by 930 the crowd gathers outside the bank for at least  half an hour theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time they clutter the footpath so many of them it takes a while for us to sort out who’s there we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called on our deep cool verandah we sit the twins there are no mirrors in our hallway

 its not exile homes and families behind us where we meet it happens anywhere now a stateless state of no name quietly seceding from the crumbling empires round us  without stamps or eurovision entries noone does it with a rough guide in a week you inhabit it or nothing like this in a pavement cafe you blink and you seem to surprise them  the crowd all its separate faces at once coming out of solution like crystals like a rush of starlings or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning now and dents your cappuccino froth  with a crisp little sound and thats it between breaths just between you and me as if yes qed you are received this is the freedom of the city and the key  to the kingdom and its borders ripple outwards like a frill of breaking wave onto flat sand a wavering line already fading leaving spumeflecks high and dry  a prickling on your palm youre five years old looking up at the whole sea unsure will you laugh or cry

 before the moths have even appeared to orbit around them the streetlamps come on a long row of them glowing uselessly  along the ring of garden that circles the city center where your steps count down the dulling of daylight at your feet a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding  summer specializes in time slows it down almost to dream and the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle  mutter in disbeliefeverything in the world is being thrown away summer lingers but it’s about ending it’s about how things redden and ripen and burst and come down it’s when  city workers cut down trees demolishing one limb at a time spilling the crumbs of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street  sunglasses the man softly exclaims while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons huddled around a dropped piece of bread

 on magnolia avenue there are no magnolias someone bought the house of the one survivor all morning i heard the chainsaw sever its limbs from root to bud no more scattered flowers star city no pink galaxy now the yard is a parking space one jeep suv one older car next door a woman comes out late afternoon a child in her arms she speaks low as if there’s just the two of them she says to him listen to the little birdies and he listens to the common sparrows talking in the hedge he listens as they argue back and forth their dialect of nature as the street clatters with commuters taking a shortcut home she says listen and he turns his head to follow the fugitive motion the small streaked wings unfolding folding the relentless chirp from a tiny blunt beak the sound almost within reach

 once we were coming back from a fête votive in goudargues when sticky with pink barbe à papa and queasy because the hairpinning road through st marcel de careiret resembled the crazymaze passage of our caroming bumper car we were met by a stream of sangliers wild boars  dashing across the d9 near the forêt de cavillargues  they pelted in a single ribbon as i recall so how could we even tell what they were how distinguish that ruche of  shadow and wind from any other ghost of  the district  that year i came across a theory about the suffix –argues that trails behind village names all around here vallérargues st andré d’olérargues goussargues foussargues it may refer to an area of  land given to roman soldiers after service in north africa by the praetor in nîmes cavillargues the acres of cavillus perhaps  the hairy pigs had emigrated perhaps from the caucasus and no doubt had settled the val de tave long before cavillus arrived to begin gentrification he wandered from the marble steps of the maison carrée perhaps having paid obeisance to roman gods and governors perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk and les sangliers came out to give him a thrill and to tell him  that this is not yet the forêt de cavillargues  you can’t run through it as if you were a groundlevel mistral  with your feet like bound clumps of asparagus  and your eyes on the perseid meteor showers  all roads lead to rome except ours

 mea book in the attic maybe some covenant or hymnal or a chapter from the kama sutra or a spell for intimate afflictions but then it seems i am none of these if i were someone would have read me  apparently at an assembly of revolutionaries they passed a resolution and i am a longhand copy of it it has the police’s stamp on it and was never successfully enforced it is preserved only for the sake of procedure  and now only some sparrows come straw in their beaks and sit on my body and worry about the next generation how wonderful to worry about the next generation sparrows have wings on them but resolutions have no wings or resolutions have no second generation  sometimes i think to catch the scent what lies in my future worry makes my binding come off whenever i try to smell just some fumes of bird shit o my earth your future meyour current state

 there was a message i have forgotten it there was a journey to make it did not come to anything but these nights my friend under the iron roof of this old rabbiters hut where the traps are still hanging up on nails lying in a dry bunk i feel strangely at ease the true dreams those longedfor strangers begin to come to me through the gates of horn  i will not explain them but the city all that other life in which we crept sadly like animals through thickets of dark thorns haunted by the moisture of women and the rock of barren friendship has now another shape yes i thank you i saw you rise like a triton a great reddish gourd of flesh from the sofa at that last party while your mistress smiled that perfect smile and shout as if drowning you are always despair is the only gift when it is shared it becomes a different thing like rock like water and so you also can share this emptiness with me  tears from faces of stone they are our own tears even if i had forgotten them the mountain that has taken my being to itself would still hang over this hut with the dead and the living twined in its crevasses my door has forgotten how to shut

 beloved men in thick green coats came crunching through the snow the insignia on their shoulders of uncertain origin a country i could not be sure of a salute so terrifying i heard myself lying to avoid arrest and was arrested along with jocko whose tear had snapped off a tiny icicle he put in his mouth we were taken to the ice prison a palace encrusted with hoarfrost its dome lit from within jocko admired the wiring he kicked the walls to test the strength of his new boots  a television stood in a block of ice its blue image still moving like a liquid center you asked for my innermost thoughts  i wonder will i ever see a grape again  when i think of the vineyard where we met in octoberwhen you dropped a cluster custom insisted you be kissed by a strangerhow after the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms turned pink  it seemed our future was sealed  everyone said so  it is quiet here  not closing our ranks weakens us hugely  the snowflakes fall in a featureless bath  i am the stranger who kissed you  on sunny days each tree is a glittering chandelier  the power of mindless beauty  jocko told a joke and has been dead since may  a bullethole in his forehead the officers call a third eye  for a month i milked a barnful of cows  it is a lot like cleansing a chandelier  wipe and polish wipe and polish round and round you go i have lost my spectacles  is the book i was reading still open by the side of our bed  treat it as a bookmark saving my place in our story  here the letter breaks off

 the naked man in the caravan has peace of mind he whose covering belongs to others is uncovered he who has luck will have the winds blow him his firewood he whose trousers are made of dry grass should not warm himself at the fire he howled before going mad he led the lion by the ear like the sparrow he wanted to imitate the pigeon’s walk but lost his own walk with sandals till you get good shoes where the turban moves there moves the territory men meet but mountains don’t always taking out without giving back even the mountains will be broken down penny piled on penny will make a heap only the unlucky coin is left in the purse as long as a human being lives he will learn learn to shave by shaving orphans he who is to be hanged can insult the pasha in the house of a man who has been hanged don’t talk of rope the small donkey is the one that everybody rides fish eat fish and he who has no might dies my belly before my children

 i’ve been excited about him as an individual i’ve met him as a person emerging from his own shadow indeed it is remarkable indeed it is to be remarked of my friend savage that the desolation of hopes not merely deferred but by impracticability brutalized little marred his genial spirit how such a one so circumstanced by parentage the mother crippled by disappointment the father by rotgut and percodan as to blight his prospects and blacken with untimely frost the buds of those ambitions justly excited by manifest powers graces and propensities should nonetheless display discrimination not inferior to those we deem wise sympathy judicious and above reproach is cause for a wonder neither cynicism can besmirch nor incredulity subvert in and out of juvie jacking cars at fifteen snorting lines of adderall his nostrils stained blue kicked out taken back kicked out busted paroled busted again straining to reach the shiny object fallen through the grate tantalizing just beyond his fingers finding and losing god thinking as he rakes the leaves of the linden tree outside the sublet bungalow that eating sleeping dying are what it’s all about nothing else maybe a few sunsets forget about sex

 a group of young men in jacksonville florida arranged to celebrate lincoln’s birthday in 1900 my brother j rosamond johnson and i decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises i wrote the words and he wrote the music our new york publisher edward b marks made mimeographed copies for us and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children shortly afterwards my brother and i moved away from jacksonville to new york and the song passed out of our minds but the school children of jacksonville kept singing it they went off to other schools and sang it they became teachers and taught it to other children within twenty years it was being sung over the south and in some other parts of the country today the song popularly known as the negro national hymn is quite generally used the lines of this song repay me in an elation almost of exquisite anguish whenever i hear them sung by negro children lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring ring with the harmonies of liberty let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies let it resound loud as the rolling sea sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us facing the rising sun of our new day begun let us march on till victory is won  stony the road we trod bitter the chastening rod felt in the days when hope unborn had died yet with a steady beat have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed we have come over a way that with tears has been watered we have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered out from the gloomy past till now we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast  god of our weary years god of our silent tears thou who hast brought us thus far on the way thou who hast by thy might led us into the light keep us forever in the path we pray lest our feet stray from the places our god where we met thee lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world we forget thee shadowed beneath thy hand may we forever stand true to our god true to our native land

 confess it’s my profession that alarms you this is why few people ask me to dinner though lord knows i don’t go out of my way to be scary i wear dresses of sensible cut and unalarming shades of beige i smell of lavender and go to the hairdresser’s no prophetess mane of mine complete with snakes will frighten the youngsters if i roll my eyes and mutter if i clutch at my heart and scream in horror like a thirdrate actress chewing up a mad scene i do it in private and nobody sees but the bathroom mirror  in general i might agree with you women should not contemplate war should not weigh tactics impartially or evade the word enemy  or view both sides and denounce nothing women should march for peace or hand out white feathers to arouse bravery spit themselves on bayonets to protect their babies whose skulls will be split anyway or having been raped repeatedly hang themselves with their own hair these are the functions that inspire general comfort that and the knitting of socks for the troops and a sort of moral cheerleading also mourning the dead sons lovers and so forth all the killed children  instead of this i tell what i hope will pass as truth a blunt thing not lovely the truth is seldom welcome especially at dinner though i am good at what i do my trade is courage and atrocities i look at them and do not condemn i write things down the way they happened as near as can be remembered i don’t ask why  because it is mostly the same wars happen because the ones who start them think they can win  in my dreams there is glamour the vikings leave their fields each year for a few months of killing and plunder much as the boys go hunting in real life they were farmers they come back loaded with splendour the arabs ride against crusaders with scimitars that could sever silk in the air a swift cut to the horse’s neck and a hunk of armour crashes down like a tower fire against metal a poet might say romance against banality when awake i know better  despite the propaganda there are no monsters or none that can be finally buried finish one off and circumstances and the radio create another believe me whole armies have prayed fervently to god all night and meant it and been slaughtered anyway brutality wins frequently and large outcomes have turned on the invention of a mechanical device viz radar true valour sometimes counts for something as at thermopylae sometimes being right though ultimate virtue by agreed tradition is decided by the winner sometimes men throw themselves on grenades and burst like paper bags of guts to save their comrades i can admire that but rats and cholera have won many wars those and potatoes or the absence of them it’s no use pinning all those medals across the chests of the dead impressive but i know too much grand exploits merely depress me  in the interests of research i have walked on many battlefields that once were liquid with pulped men’s bodies and spangled with exploded shells and splayed bone all of them have been green again by the time i got there each has inspired a few good quotes in its day sad marble angels brood like hens over the grassy nests where nothing hatches the angels could just as well be described as vulgar  or pitiless  depending on camera angle the word glory figures a lot on gateways of course i pick a flower or two from each and press it in the hotel bible for a souvenir i’m just as human as you  but it’s no use asking me for a final statement as i say i deal in tactics also statistics for every year of peace there have been four hundred years of war

 a little loam and topsoil is a lot  heather mchugh a vacant lot maybe but even such lit vacancy as interstate motels announce can look well pretty damned inviting after a long day’s drive especially if the day has been oppressed by manic truckers detours endless road construction and this poorly measured semi rectangle projected and plotted with the familiar little flags upon a spread of neglected terra firma also offers brief apprehension whichlet’s face it whether pleasing or encumbered by anxietydwells luxuriously in potential me well i like a little space between shopping malls and while this one may never come to be much of a garden once we rip the old tires from the brambles and bag the trash we might just glimpse the lot we meant the lot we hoped to find

 the heart dies without space for love without a moral horizon think of it then as a bird trapped in a box my heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence only toward them can one really advance that is make progress without them i feel i’m half a person romeo was born a montague and juliet came from the capulet line and i’m a disciple of shakespeare not ben gurion therefore i’ll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of haidar abdel shafi i mean this of course as a parable onlybut the parable is my measure and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair this isn’t just some idle fancy that out of poetic license i place our fate in my daughter’s sex that i grant myself this imaginary gift testifies to the extent to which we’re living still in the underworld where we’re granted the hope and potential of an amoeba but all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl spring out of the ground and devour each other until a sacred union occurs healing the breach in the world the arab groom from gaza too will extend to my daughter a dress on which is embroidered the land redeemed from apartheid’s curse our land as a whole belonging equally to all of its offspring and then he’ll lift the veil from her face and say to her “and now i take you to be my wife lotem abdel shafi”

 nudesstark and glistening yelling in lurid glee grinning faces and raging limbs whirl over the floor one fire for a shirt verminously busy yon soldier tore from his throat with oaths godhead might shrink at but not the lice and soon the shirt was aflare over the candle he’d lit while we lay  then we all sprang up and stript to hunt the verminous brood soon like a demons’ pantomime the place was raging see the silhouettes agape see the gibbering shadows mixed with the battled arms on the wall see gargantuan hooked fingers pluck in supreme flesh to smutch supreme littleness see the merry limbs in hot highland fling because some wizard vermin charmed from the quiet this revel when our ears were half lulled by the dark music blown from sleep’s trumpet

 a satire upon the trueblue protestant poet ts all human things are subject to decay and when fate summons monarchs must obey this flecknoe found who like augustus young was calld to empire and had governd long in prose and verse was ownd without dispute through all the realms of nonsense absolute this aged prince now flourishing in peace and blest with issue of a large increase worn out with business did at length debate to settle the succession of the state and pondring which of all his sons was fit to reign and wage immortal war with wit cryd tis resolvd for nature pleads that he should only rule who most resembles me shadwell alone my perfect image bears mature in dullness from his tender years shadwell alone of all my sons is he who stands confirmd in full stupidity the rest to some faint meaning make pretence but shadwell never deviates into sense some beams of wit on other souls may fall strike through and make a lucid interval but shadwells genuine night admits no ray his rising fogs prevail upon the day besides his goodly fabric fills the eye and seems designd for thoughtless majesty thoughtless as monarch oaks that shade the plain and spread in solemn state supinely reign heywood and shirley were but types of thee thou last great prophet of tautology even i a dunce of more renown than they was sent before but to prepare thy way and coarsely clad in norwich drugget came to teach the nations in thy greater name my warbling lute the lute i whilom strung when to king john of portugal i sung was but the prelude to that glorious day when thou on silver thames didst cut thy way with well timd oars before the royal barge swelld with the pride of thy celestial charge and big with hymn commander of an host the like was neer in epsom blankets tossd methinks i see the new arion sail the lute still trembling underneath thy nail at thy well sharpend thumb from shore to shore the treble squeaks for fear the basses roar echoes from pissingalley shadwell call and shadwell they resound from aston hall about thy boat the little fishes throng as at the morning toast that floats along sometimes as prince of thy harmonious band thou wieldst thy papers in thy threshing hand st andres feet neer kept more equal time not evn the feet of thy own psyches rhyme though they in number as in sense excel so just so like tautology they fell that pale with envy singleton forswore the lute and sword which he in triumph bore and vowd he neer would act villerius more here stopt the good old sire and wept for joy in silent raptures of the hopeful boy all arguments but most his plays persuade that for anointed dullness he was made  close to the walls which fair augusta bind the fair augusta much to fears inclind an ancient fabric raisd tinform the sight there stood of yore and barbican it hight a watch tower once but now so fate ordains of all the pile an empty name remains from its old ruins brothelhouses rise scenes of lewd loves and of polluted joys where their vast courts the motherstrumpets keep and undisturbd by watch in silence sleep near these a nursery erects its head where queens are formd and future heroes bred where unfledgd actors learn to laugh and cry where infant punks their tender voices try and little maximins the gods defy great fletcher never treads in buskins here nor greater jonson dares in socks appear but gentle simkin just reception finds amidst this monument of vanishd minds pure clinches the suburbian muse affords and panton waging harmless war with words here flecknoe as a place to fame well known ambitiously designd his shadwells throne for ancient decker prophesid long since that in this pile should reign a mighty prince born for a scourge of wit and flail of sense to whom true dullness should some psyches owe but worlds of misers from his pen should flow humorists and hypocrites it should produce whole raymond families and tribes of bruce  now empress fame had publisht the renown of shadwells coronation through the town rousd by report of fame the nations meet from near bunhill and distant watlingstreet no persian carpets spread thimperial way but scatterd limbs of mangled poets

should his vow be vain that he till death true dullness would maintain and in his fathers right and realms defence neer to have peace with wit nor truce with sense the king himself the sacred unction made as king by office and as priest by trade in his sinister hand instead of ball he placd a mighty mug of potent ale loves kingdom to his right he did convey at once his sceptre and his rule of sway whose righteous lore the prince had practisd young and from whose loins recorded psyche sprung his temples last with poppies were oer spread that nodding seemd to consecrate his head just at that point of time if fame not lie on his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly so romulus tis sung by tibers brook presage of sway from twice six vultures took thadmiring throng loud acclamations make and omens of his future empire take the sire then shook the honours of his head and from his brows damps of oblivion shed full on the filial dullness long he stood repelling from his breast the raging

his throne beyond loves kingdom let him stretch his pen he pausd and all the people cryd amen then thus continud he my son advance still in new impudence new ignorance success let other teach learn

and loveit rage let cully cockwood fopling charm the pit and in their folly show the writers wit yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence and justify their authors want of sense let em be all by thy own model made of dullness and desire no foreign aid that they to future ages may be known not copies drawn but issue of thy own nay let thy men of wit too be the same all full of thee and differing but in name but let no alien sedley interpose to lard with wit thy hungry epsom prose and when false flowers of rhetoric thou wouldst cull trust nature do not labour to be dull but write thy best and top and in each line sir formals oratory will be thine sir formal though unsought attends thy quill and does thy northern dedications fill nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame by arrogating jonsons hostile name let father flecknoe fire thy mind with praise and uncle ogleby thy envy raise thou art my blood where jonson has no part what share have we in nature or in art where

my arse promisd a play and dwindled to a farce when did his muse from fletcher scenes purloin as thou whole ethridge dost transfuse to thine but so transfusd as oil on waters flow his always floats above thine sinks below this is thy province this thy wondrous way new humours to invent for each new play this is that boasted bias of thy mind by which one way to dullness tis inclind which makes thy writings lean on one side still and in all changes that way bends thy will nor let thy mountain belly make pretence of likeness thines a tympany of sense a tun of man in thy large bulk is writ but sure thou rt but a kilderkin of wit like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep thy tragic muse gives smiles thy comic sleep with whateer gall thou settst thy self to write thy inoffensive satires never bite in thy felonious heart though venom lies it does but touch thy irish pen and dies thy genius calls thee not to purchase fame in keen iambics but mild anagram leave writing plays and choose for thy command some peaceful province in acrostic land there thou mayst wings display and altars raise and torture one poor word ten thousand ways or if thou wouldst thy diffrent talents suit set thy own songs and sing them to thy lute he said but his last words were scarcely heard for bruce and longvil had a trap prepard and down they sent the yet declaiming bard sinking he left his drugget robe

 earth’s wrath at our assaults is slow to come but relentless when it does it has to do with catastrophic change and with the limit at which one order more of magnitude will bring us to a qualitative change and disasters drastically different from those we daily have to know about  as with the speed of light where speed itself becomes a limit and an absolute as with the splitting of the atom and a little later of the nucleus as with the millions rising into billions the piker’s kind in terms of money yes but a million 2 in terms of time and space as the universe grew vast while the earth our habitat diminished to the size of a billiard ball both relative to the cosmos and to the numbers of ourselves the doubling numbers the earth could accommodate  we stand now in the place and limit of time where hardest knowledge is turning into dream and nightmares still contained in sleeping dark seem on the point of bringing into day the sweating panic that starts the sleeper up one or another nightmare may come true and what to do then what in the world to do

 for my father i listened to them talking talking that tableful of keen and clever folk sputtering    followed by a pale and balking sort of flash whenever some one spoke like musty fireworks or a pointless joke followed by a pointless musty laughter then without a pause the sputtering once again    the air was thick with epigrams and smoke and underneath it all it seemed that furtive things began to crawl hissing and striking in the dark aiming at no particular mark and careless whom they hurt the petty jealousies the smiling hates shot forth their venom as they passed the plates and hissed and struck again aroused alert using their feeble smartness as a screen to shield their poisonous stabbing to divert from what was cowardly and black and mean  then i thought of you your gentle soul your large and quiet kindness ready to caution and console and with an almost blindness to what was mean and low baseness you never knew you could not think that falsehood was untrue nor that deceit would ever dare betray you you even trusted treachery and so guileless what guile or evil could dismay you you were for counsels rather than commands your sweetness was your strength your strength a sweetness that drew all men and made reluctant hands rest long upon your shoulder firm but never proud you walked your sixty years as through a crowd of friends who loved to feel your warmth and who knowing that warmth knew you even the casual beholder could see your fresh and generous completeness like dawn in a deep forest growing and shining through such faith has soothed and armed you it has smiled frankly and unashamed at death and like a child swayed half by joy and half by reticence walking beside its nurse you walk with life protected by your smile and an immense security and simple confidence  hearing the talkers talk i thought of you    and it was like a great wind blowing over confused and poisonous places it was like sterile spaces crowded with birds and grasses soaked clear through with sunlight quiet and vast and clean and it was forests growing and it was black things turning green and it was laughter on a thousand faces    it was like victory rising from defeat the world made well again and strongand sweet

 she has been condemned to death by hanging a man may escape this death by becoming the hangman a woman by marrying the hangman but at the present time there is no hangman thus there is no escape there is only a death indefinitely postponed this is not fantasy it is history    to live in prison is to live without mirrors to live without mirrors is to live without the self she is living selflessly she finds a hole in the stone wall and on the other side of the wall a voice the voice comes through darkness and has no face this voice becomes her mirror    in order to avoid her death her particular death with wrung neck and swollen tongue she must marry the hangman but there is no hangman first she must create him she must persuade this man at the end of the voice this voice she has never seen and which has never seen her this darkness she must persuade him to renounce his face exchange it for the impersonal mask of death of official death which has eyes but no mouth this mask of a dark leper she must transform his hands so they will be willing to twist the rope around throats that have been singled out as hers was throats other than hers she must marry the hangman or no one but that is not so bad who else is there to marry    you wonder about her crime she was condemned to death for stealing clothes from her employer from the wife of her employer she wished to make herself more beautiful this desire in servants was not legal    she uses her voice like a hand her voice reaches through the wall stroking and touching what could she possibly have said that would have convinced him he was not condemned to death freedom awaited him what was the temptation the one that worked perhaps he wanted to live with a woman whose life he had saved who had seen down into the earth but had nevertheless followed him back up to life it was his only chance to be a hero to one person at least for if he became the hangman the others would despise him he was in prison for wounding another man on one finger of the right hand with a sword this too is history    my friends who are both women tell me their stories which cannot be believed and which are true they are horror stories and they have not happened to me they have not yet happened to me they have happened to me but we are detached we watch our unbelief with horror such things cannot happen to us it is afternoon and these things do not happen in the afternoon the trouble was she said i didn’t have time to put my glasses on and without them i’m blind as a bat i couldn’t even see who it was these things happen and we sit at a table and tell stories about them so we can finally believe this is not fantasy it is history there is more than one hangman and because of this some of them are unemployed    he said the end of walls the end of ropes the opening of doors a field the wind a house the sun a table an apple  she said nipple arms lips wine belly hair bread thighs eyes eyes  they both kept their promises    the hangman is not such a bad fellow afterwards he goes to the refrigerator and cleans up the leftovers though he does not wipe up what he accidentally spills he wants only the simple things a chair someone to pull off his shoes someone to watch him while he talks with admiration and fear gratitude if possible someone in whom to plunge himself for rest and renewal these things can best be had by marrying a woman who has been condemned to death by other men for wishing to be beautiful there is a wide choice    everyone said he was a fool everyone said she was a clever woman they used the word ensnare     what did they say the first time they were alone together in the same room what did he say when she had removed her veil and he could see that she was not a voice but a body and therefore finite what did she say when she discovered that she had left one locked room for another they talked of love naturally though that did not keep them busy forever    the fact is there are no stories i can tell my friends that will make them feel better history cannot be erased although we can soothe ourselves by speculating about it at that time there were no female hangmen perhaps there have never been any and thus no man could save his life by marriage though a woman could according to the law    he said foot boot order city fist roads time knife  she said water night willow rope hair earth belly cave meat shroud open blood  they both kept their promises

 mourning doves are not owls after a while away from the city      not because the country appears of a softer feather       less predatory  youre thinking a sound more naturally friendly less edgy and dangerous than the subway but because the  city city to city within itself so sharply details for you   actually walks you through a training in the amplitudes of form  after a while that sharpness wipes the smile the natural had you putting on everything really owls       are so soft       their deadly  accuracy of flight depending on it they are all but silent      a recognizable law nobody says shit you learn       the city  has taught you to  pick up on     which wings bring the disk of their sun for around your neck each day  and which take you out and that your green act of good is natural in that it too depends on the weather

 for a long time the spanish from spain who came here became slightly insane in a special way and just a little you can try this yourself walk farther than you can into the forest in new york so it’s a tossup whether or not you know the way back for you there’s going to be a smidge of confusion a glow of fear that smells like burning rye toast and the illusion that you are the only person alive on the earth you will probably have the second illusion that no one likes you which doesn’t jibe with the first illusion of no other people this was about the extent of it for the spanish they felt all that just a few hours a week but every week at home living in say small san francisco which made thinking slow and hard at these times but if you try this yourself in the deep woods you’ll see you can still think enough and you’ll remember your way back to the loving arms of your wife husband or mother in rochester yes you could try it as a child but please don’t the spanish had a purpose to walk east inland to the sierras the gold the indians said there were five hills and two mountains entirely of gold and you had to wear ferns dangling before your eyes like sunglasses when you got near the mountains the hills they said were not so bright the spanish thought this was bullshit but were having trouble with the coast where they truly believed the gold was which was that boats could not travel north and south even as fast as people walking because the pacific coast was opposing currents you made half a mile an hour in the water with biggest sail an expedition of thirty spaniards from spain living in small san francisco walked east inland toward what’s now mariposa it means butterfly in that place the shivering feathery insects rose from the ground and blacked out the sun the sky had no room for more butterflies so the leftovers attached to the trees making the trees appear like ragged trees look up the other way the explorers said to each other but that way when they did was no blue sky but darkness of orange insects that did not fly in clouds but were the sky so any forward motion by the thirty men seemed not seemed did make the sky covered each inch with the thin trembling insects brown or green or orange but as a whole a black ceiling with little light between them and the men who thought slow and hard but did think and so returned to small san francisco where no one believed them but understood the illusion because when they asked the thirty men what such an encounter with butterflies felt like the men described feeling the way all the colonists and explorers and priests and women felt a few hours each week at home fear making the olfactory illusion of burning rye toast hand in hand with the illusion of being the only one and the simultaneous but contradictory illusion that no one likes you how could everybody hate you if there was no everybody or even anybody well there was a way to fix this and we use it now around here i mean in new york and california and nevada and hawaii not just in my house which is to wrap our loving arms around each other it works very well and i know you’ve tried it the spanish from spain brought virtuous women over for that purpose only you don’t think the virtuous babes looked for gold did you and it worked very well except the women were worse i mean much worse not just specially a little insane and needed the loving arms much more than the men they needed longer sessions and more sessions what’s more if the expedition of thirty butterfly illusionists had gone six miles further they would have seen silver sticking out of the ground like glass after a fourcar accident on a street in rochester but for many decades the promise of the waiting loving arms versus the unacceptable illusion of the butterflies forming the entire black sky kept them near the coasts when you put down this book you could decide for yourself if it is true that wrapping loving arms around somebody is as temporarily powerful as i’ve made it out to be or is possibly permanently powerful or is an illusion like the massed feathery insects which were absolute

 1  the angel  three years we waited for him attention riveted closely scanning the pines the shore the stars one with the blade of the plough or the ship’s keel we were searching to find once more the first seed so that the ageold drama could begin again  we returned to our homes broken limbs incapable mouths cracked by the tastes of rust and brine when we woke we traveled towards the north strangers plunged into mist by the immaculate wings of swans that wounded us on winter nights the strong wind from the east maddened us in the summers we were lost in the agony of days that couldn’t die  we brought back these carved reliefs of a humble art    2  still one more well inside a cave it used to be easy for us to draw up idols and ornaments to please those friends who still remained loyal to us  the ropes have broken only the grooves on the well’s lip remind us of our past happiness the fingers on the rim as the poet put it the fingers feel the coolness of the stone a little then the body’s fever prevails over it and the cave stakes its soul and loses it every moment full of silence without a drop of water    3  remember the baths where you were murdered  i woke with this marble head in my hands it exhausts my elbow and i don’t know where to put it down it was falling into the dream as i was coming out of the dream so our life became one and it will be very difficult for it to separate again  i look at the eyes neither open nor closed i speak to the mouth which keeps trying to speak i hold the cheeks which have broken through the skin that’s all i’m able to do  my hands disappear and come towards me mutilated    4  argonauts  and a soul if it is to know itself must look into its own soul the stranger and enemy we’ve seen him in the mirror  they were good the companions they didn’t complain about the work or the thirst or the frost they had the bearing of trees and waves that accept the wind and the rain accept the night and the sun without changing in the midst of change they were fine whole days they sweated at the oars with lowered eyes breathing in rhythm and their blood reddened a submissive skin sometimes they sang with lowered eyes as we were passing the deserted island with the barbary figs to the west beyond the cape of the dogs that bark if it is to know itself they said it must look into its own soul they said and the oar’s struck the sea’s gold in the sunset we went past many capes many islands the sea leading to another sea gulls and seals sometimes disconsolate women wept lamenting their lost children and others frantic sought alexander the great and glories buried in the depths of asia  we moored on shores full of nightscenes the birds singing with waters that left on the hands the memory of a great happiness but the voyages did not end their souls became one with the oars and the oarlocks with the solemn face of the prow with the rudder’s wake with the water that shattered their image the companions died one by one with lowered eyes their oars mark the place where they sleep on the shore  no one remembers them justice    5  we didn’t know them deep down it was hope that said we’d known them since early childhood we saw them perhaps twice and then they took to the ships cargoes of coal cargoes of grain and our friends lost beyond the ocean forever dawn finds us beside the tired lamp drawing on paper awkwardly painfully ships mermaids or sea shells at dusk we go down to the river because it shows us the way to the sea and we spend the nights in cellars that smell of tar  our friends have left us perhaps we never saw them perhaps we met them when sleep still brought us close to the breathing wave perhaps we search for them because we search for the other life beyond the statues    6  mr  the garden with its fountains in the rain you will see only from behind the clouded glass of the low window your room will be lit only by the flames from the fireplace and sometimes the distant lightning will reveal the wrinkles on your forehead my old friend  the garden with the fountains that in your hands was a rhythm of the other life beyond the broken statues and the tragic columns and a dance among the oleanders near the new quarries  misty glass will have cut it off from your life you won’t breathe earth and the sap of the trees will spring from your memory to strike this window struck by rain from the outside world    7  south wind  westward the sea merges with a mountain range from our left the south wind blows and drives us mad the kind of wind that strips bones of their flesh our house among pines and carobs large windows large tables for writing you the letters we’ve been writing so many months now dropping them into the space between us in order to fill it up  star of dawn when you lowered your eyes our hours were sweeter than oil on a wound more joyful than cold water to the palate more peaceful than a swan’s wings you held our life in the palm of your hand after the bitter bread of exile at night if we remain in front of the white wall your voice approaches us like the hope of fire and again this wind hones a razor against our nerves  each of us writes you the same thing and each falls silent in the other’s presence watching each of us the same world separately the light and darkness on the mountain range and you who will lift this sorrow from our hearts yesterday evening a heavy rain and again today the covered sky burdens us our thoughts – like the pine needles of yesterday’s downpour bunched up and useless in front of our doorway  would build a collapsing tower  among these decimated villages on this promontory open to the south wind with the mountain range in front of us hiding you who will appraise for us the sentence to oblivion who will accept our offering at this close of autumn    8  what are they after our souls travelling on the decks of decayed ships crowded in with sallow women and crying babies unable to forget themselves either with the flying fish or with the stars that the masts point our at their tips grated by gramophone records committed to nonexistent pilgrimages unwillingly murmuring broken thoughts from foreign languages  what are they after our souls travelling on rotten brinesoaked timbers from harbour to harbour  shifting broken stones breathing in the pine’s coolness with greater difficulty each day swimming in the waters of this sea and of that sea without the sense of touch without men in a country that is no longer ours nor yours  we knew that the islands were beautiful somewhere round about here where we grope slightly lower down or slightly higher up a tiny space    9  the harbour is old i can’t wait any longer for the friend who left the island with the pine trees for the friend who left the island with the plane trees for the friend who left for the open sea i stroke the rusted cannons i stroke the oars so that my body may revive and decide the sails give off only the smell of salt from the other storm  if i chose to remain alone what i longed for was solitude not this kind of waiting my soul shattered on the horizon these lines these colours this silence  the night’s stars take me back to odysseus to his anticipation of the dead among the asphodels when we moored here we hoped to find among the asphodels the gorge that knew the wounded adonis    10  our country is closed in all mountains that day and night have the low sky as their roof we have no rivers we have no wells we have no springs only a few cisterns  and these empty  that echo and that we worship a stagnant hollow sound the same as our loneliness the same as our love the same as our bodies we find it strange that once we were able to build our houses huts and sheepfolds and our marriages the cool coronals and the fingers become enigmas inexplicable to our soul how were our children born how did they grow strong  our country is closed in the two black symplegades close it in when we go down to the harbours on sunday to breathe freely we see lit in the sunset the broken planks from voyages that never ended bodies that no longer know how to love    11  sometimes your blood froze like the moon in the limitless night your blood spread its white wings over the black rocks the shapes of trees and houses with a little light from our childhood years    12  bottle in the sea  three rocks a few burnt pines a lone chapel and farther above the same landscape repeated starts again three rocks in the shape of a gateway rusted a few burnt pines black and yellow and a square hut buried in whitewash and still farther above many times over the same landscape recurs level after level to the horizon to the twilit sky  here we moored the ship to splice the broken oars to drink water and to sleep the sea that embittered us is deep and unexplored and unfolds a boundless calm here among the pebbles we found a coin and threw dice for it the youngest won it and disappeared  we put to sea again with our broken oars    13  hydra  dolphins banners and the sound of cannons the sea once so bitter to your soul bore the manycoloured and glittering ships it swayed rolled and tossed them all blue with white wings once so bitter to your soul now full of colours in the sun  white sails and sunlight and wet oars struck with a rhythm of drums on stilled waves  your eyes watching would be beautiful your arms reaching out would glow your lips would come alive as they used to at such a miracle that’s what you were looking for what were you looking for in front of ashes or in the rain in the fog in the wind even when the lights were growing dim and the city was sinking and on the stone pavement the nazarene showed you his heart what were you looking for why don’t you come what were you looking for    14  three red pigeons in the light inscribing our fate in the light with colours and gestures of people we once loved    15  quid πλατανων opacissimus  sleep wrapped you in green leaves like a tree you breathed like a tree in the quiet light in the limpid spring i looked at your face eyelids closed eyelashes brushing the water in the soft grass my fingers found your fingers i held your pulse a moment and felt elsewhere your heart’s pain  under the plane tree near the water among laurel sleep moved you and scattered you around me near me without my being able to touch the whole of you  one as you were with your silence seeing your shadow grow and diminish lose itself in the other shadows in the other world that let you go yet held you back  the life that they gave us to live we lived pity those who wait with such patience lost in the black laurel under the heavy plane trees and those alone who speak to cisterns and wells and drown in the voice’s circles pity the companion who shared our privation and our sweat and plunged into the sun like a crow beyond the ruins without hope of enjoying our reward  give us outside sleep serenity    16  the name is orestes  on the track once more on the track on the track how many times around how many bloodstained laps how many black rows the people who watch me who watched me when in the chariot i raised my hand glorious and they roared triumphantly  the froth of the horses strikes me when will the horses tire the axle creaks the axle burns when will the axle burst into flame when will the reins break when will the hooves tread flush on the ground on the soft grass among the poppies where in the spring you picked a daisy they were lovely your eyes but you didn’t know where to look nor did i know where to look i without a country i who go on struggling here how many times around and i feel my knees give way over the axle over the wheels over the wild track knees buckle easily when the gods so will it no one can escape what use is strength you can’t escape the sea that cradled you and that you search for at this time of trial with the horses panting with the reeds that used to sing in autumn to the lydian mode the sea you cannot find no matter how you run no matter how you circle past the black bored eumenides unforgiven    17  astyanax  now that you are leaving take the boy with you as well the boy who saw the light under the plane tree one day when trumpets resounded and weapons shone and the sweating horses bent to the trough to touch with wet nostrils the green surface of the water  the olive trees with the wrinkles of our fathers the rocks with the wisdom of our fathers and our brother’s blood alive on the earth were a vital joy a rich pattern for the souls who knew their prayer  now that you are leaving now that the day of payment dawns now that no one knows whom he will kill and how he will die take with you the boy who saw the light under the leaves of that plane tree and teach him to study the trees    18  i regret having let a broad river slip through my fingers without drinking a single drop now i’m sinking into the stone a small pine tree in the red soil is all the company i have whatever i loved vanished with the houses that were new last summer and crumbled in the winds of autumn    19  even if the wind blows it doesn’t cool us and the shade is meagre under the cypress trees and all around slopes ascending to the mountains  they’re a burden for us the friends who no longer know how to die    20  in my breast the wound opens again when the stars descend and become kin to my body when silence falls under the footsteps of men  these stones sinking into time how far will they drag me with them the sea the sea who will be able to drain it dry i see the hands beckon each drawn to the vulture and the hawk bound as i am to the rock that suffering has made mine i see the trees breathing the black serenity of the dead and then the smiles so static of the statues    21  we who set out on this pilgrimage looked at the broken statues became distracted and said that life is not so easily lost that death has unexplored paths and its own particular justice  that while we still upright on our feet are dying affiliated in stone united in hardness and weakness the ancient dead have escaped the circle and risen again and smile in a strange silence    22  so very much having passed before our eyes that even our eyes saw nothing but beyond and behind was memory like the white sheet one night in an enclosure where we saw strange visions even stranger than you pass by and vanish into the motionless foliage of a pepper tree  having known this fate of ours so well wandering among broken stones three or six thousand years searching in collapsed buildings that might have been our homes trying to remember dates and heroic deeds will we be able  having been bound and scattered having struggled as they said with nonexistent difficulties lost then finding again a road full of blind regiments sinking in marshes and in the lake of marathon will we be able to die as we should    23  a little farther we will see the almond trees blossoming the marble gleaming in the sun the sea breaking into waves  a little farther let us rise a little higher    24  here end the works of the sea the works of love those who will some day live here where we end  should the blood happen to darken in their memory and overflow  let them not forget us the weak souls among the asphodels let them turn the heads of the victims towards erebus  we who had nothing will school them in serenity

 like fishermen at dusk the soldiers returned from war with stories slumped over their shoulders their fingers firm at the knot the netting thick and tangled with the names of the dead  none could explain how the flood of life all around them escaped like water from between cupped hands how the bodies of men they loved began to crust the earth like salt how destruction danced slapdash and unashamed everywhere and still they survived  when i came home from college proud my educated mouth agape a tackle box of words slick and glossy and i saw the names of my friends the young men i fought with learned to drink with and left behind  lil’rocc pumpkin ulysses junebug aghoster names spraypainted throughout our neighborhood in memoriam i couldn’t understand how a god could make one life possible and strip the world clean of so many or how like highwatermarks the dead remind the living of the coming of storms

 1 crosshatchings palm and rain clapboard faded to the grain halfshutters open to old vines and mangroves  draining their own shadows recollecting what the body knows suspended between coral and shifting images of cloud    after death after the knowledge of death his death    his face unwrapped already yellowed papery recovered with a small white cloth   then lowered away and shut to the earth  so pierced so mute these words reopening  not this    2 the rain had gone i swam against the current harnessed by water till i turned and swung out with the tide shouldering deep  into a rhythm of my own long strokes pulled under the body and returning past the glinting crease in which i breathed  the sea halfwoken like another body bedded into sheer transparency the outer reaches granular with light  comebacks chains of radiance far more than meet the eye  what do they meet then intimate but otherworldly mimicking the world   i looked back at the land’s thin edge pines along the shoreline near a fort  where cannons rust mouths left open among thistleweed around the dozing moat  far back among fallen needles pigeons shuffle through shade their feathers iris underlight soft flares bob the dark  the land had disappeared the sun had followed it from either wrist halfmingled with my breath into the night  a trail of ungloved phosphor travelled back    3 sounds too have their surfaces  within the mortal frame particles of blood revolve as in a sort of heaven where  breath moves through us as an unseen light but when the marrow bonds are parted they in turn set loose what has been called the soul

 the eyes on a face have brought me sadness the right eye searching for seams in ripped fishnets the left eye lost and wandering the dark the eye of the baby god crawling behind a couch in the moist suburb where we planned our escape from video games and grilled cheese the eye of a whale we met in a dream who spit us out so we could make the 8 o’clock screening of on golden pond the eye of the clock blinking when the oboe wailed like a burning shofar the eye inside the eye curled upa sprouting lima bean remembering the nineteenth century those rosy drapes the eyes of missing finger tips of sad afternoons in french cafés in dayton ohio the eyes on the very real parrot who sits on the shoulders of a wax actor dressed as a pirate the eyes of an actress pretending to be my mom the eyes of my father sleeping on a train dreaming about miniature crashing planes the eyes of a swimming pool looking up or down everyone’s swimsuits and into their souls the eyes in love songs written by mean men the eyes in the painting lost in a fire where we tried to save the ancient cat the eyes underneath tap shoes clicking like teeth the eyes of fred astaire never blinking even to kiss in the dark the eyes of the state of texas secretly tattooed on everyone’s ass and the eyes on the billboard ripped and faded from rain like the eyes of the best waitress on the upper west side who knows everyone’s order even those of customers she’s never met can you hear  the eyes under my eyes they steal other people’s dreams to use them for ad copy here are the eyes of a man who’d be my husband if he hadn’t married my twin and there are the eyes of the judge who divorced them blue as his tie i forget the eye color of the first man i lovedwhat color was my hat when we cried in the snow the whites of everyone’s eyes swirl together in silent music nothing like the closed eyes of a flamenco dancer eating a dripping hamburger by the highway instead it is the right eye of a teacher when she touches her student the eyes inside my mouth and the eyes outside your mouth the eyes of the writer and reader a broken vase and a whole petal the eyes on what you thought of as a cunt and the eyes on what i thought of as a cock the small eyes on the open book and the bigger eyes of the closed book the eyes i swallow when we talk and the eyes that fly above us in sleep

 i land of refuge  a mountain of white ice standing still in the water here forty fathoms deep and flowing swiftly from the north grampuses and whales going by in companies spouting up water in streams these wonders of the lord i francis higginson saw on the way to salem a fair morning and still many leagues from land but the air warm and spiced yellow flowers on the sea sometimes singly sometimes in sheets high trees on every hill and in every dale on every island and even on the stony cliffs banks of earth on which are groves of trees and no undergrowth of bush or brambles the sandy shore overrun with vines of melons and of grapes which the beat and surging of the sea overflows this i arthur barlowe saw trees of sweetsmelling wood with rind and leaves sweetsmelling as the bark of cinnamon and leaves of bay soil dark and soft strawberries everywhere hickory nuts and sassafras here are grapes white and red very sweet and strong and plums black and red and single roses white and red and damask we have eaten venison with the indians and drunk water with spice in it indian corn even the coarsest makes as pleasant a meat as rice without any show of anger the iroquois crunched our fingers in their mouths and with their teeth tore off the nails then hacked our fingers off joint by joint with stone hatchets or with a shell too dull to cut the sinews and in the stumps of our thumbs drove up spikes until the elbow but so great the help of jesus with this maimed hand i isaac jogues jesuit and priest baptised an indian among the captives using the raindrops on a long leaf of corn  let others cry “new lands where indians shall bring kernels of gold wagons full of gold whatever spills upon the way we shall tread carelessly for we shall have so much of gold so many pearls to sew upon our clothes away unthrifty gentlemen to the forests of virginia there are lands to feed all the poor of england trees to build each a home give us but axes shovels and ploughshares and away then to america all you poor” in england a watch is set about us and we are clapt in jails and holland is a dear place for there they live by trading but we are a plain country people whose trade is husbandry and we would worship god as simply as the shepherds and galilean fishermen live as plainly away dissenters to new england a great wind is blowing heavy rain thick darkness the sailors running here and there shouting at one another to pull at this and at that rope and the waves pouring over the ship landing in the rain the cold rain falling steadily the ground wet all the leaves dripping and the rocks running with water the sky is cloud on cloud in which the brief sun barely shines the ground snow on snow the cold air wind and blast we have followed our god into this wilderness of trees heavy with snow rocks seamed with ice that in the freezing blasts the remnant of this remnant kindle so bright so lasting a fire on this continent prisoners of ice and darkness everywhere will turn and come to it to warm their hands and hearts  ii brief history  glaciers pushing so far and surely thaw and withdraw even the deep while the explosion of its waves dynamites the cliffs leaves new lands new groves and habitations beside the glittering currents flowing quickly into the silver waters of the sun  here are men who find a comfortable bed among the rocks who wrap themselves in their coats to sleep upon the ground while their horse feeds in the grass beside the lake who catch trout in the brook and roast them on the ashes eat the flesh of bear for meat the white meat of turkeys for their bread and whose salt is brought in an iron pot across the mountains who live where two hundred acres may be had for a calf and a wool hat or walk where there is no road nor any man except the savage  all the bells of boston are tolling a solemn peal the market men will take no more paper money hard money only soldiers with bare feet showing through their shoes in the snow the smoke of the campfires blowing into their eyes for food a bowl of beef soup full of burnt leaves no house or hut and even the sick in tents the rays of your light like the sun’s republic of france shone first in the west the eater shall give meat and out of the strong sweetness out of the bones of the french monarchy the honey of freedom the bells of philadelphia are ringing as if for a fire and the crowds shouting and hallooing fill the streets ring bells throughout the night let no one sleep ring clash and peal until the log cabins and cottages of cedar shingles the houses of grey stone or of brick tremble and the listeners feel in their flesh the vibrations of your metal voices ringing proclaim liberty proclaim liberty throughout the land  wrongs like molecules of gas that seep into a house explode in particles of fire a captain gallops down the street wheels and the hoof of his horse sends the pie plates shining in the sun his horse stops at what is flowing from the battlefield sniffs at it and will not cross this is not water it is blood in a thick and ropy stream the dying negress says i cannot eat dry hominy i lived in massa’s house and used to have white bread and coffee and i want something sweet in my mouth on the lawn the negroes dance and clap their hands so glad so glad bless the lord for freedom so glad so glad  do not mourn the dandelions that their golden heads become grey in no time at all and are blown about in the wind each season shall bring them again to the lawns but how long the seeds of justice stay underground how much blood and ashes of precious things to manure so rare and brief a growth  currents of waste wind along the river between the factories the colonnades and sacred groves of chimneys where once the road in ruts and ridgeslines of rails hold to a gleaming purpose come wind come rain come winter or the night build storey on storey out of glass light electric lights row after row whose shining wires will not flicker in the wind let the streets sound with the horns and hosannahs of motor cars man you need no longer drudge at plow or oar no longer trudge proclaim this liberty to all if bread may be as plentiful shall we not share it as we share water

 to reg  1season opener  the ants are licking open the peonies unwrapping the seal to the tight globes of bloom    they gang up on and chase away a ladybug i can sit here    on the porch stoop as on the step    of an amphitheater and watch    ours is a great sports city the tour guides say   even the house roofs are bleachers    some ball is always in the air ready to open    its colors fragrance like stadium food scent reaches the street    our mouths drop open    tongues about to do the work   2  the wind is so high the lake surface contracts in a gasp  the waves jump straight up  our side must be winning  i cant hear the crowd of whitecap i see from the bus run  the joggers and cyclists look as though hysterically they carry  themselves     the news and breaking sound        that maybe  theres not another side to water        nor to the whole of what we play  we field against a fog or the home game in solids ice in a change of uniform  we contend against what is and is ourselves        though  we want a side that isnt ours to have of the universe    to have us on our feet  like the waves cheering on this morning this morning  we want our messengers to lie    a pool of good news  dead silent at our feet for us to walk open    our winnings winning or not still won a life  that lets us live it the excitement    of winged ankles seas of dancing streets in the envelope   3  when the waves jumped straight up the messenger sand smashed them to pieces for winning  when the surface fainted back the stampeding sky sank its foot in that face to leave winning  there were two countless words for the score you hear the roar of silence over winning  someone screaming what are you doing what are you doing    something answers i am winning  doing nothing is thrown out the window to eliminate that way to deal with winning  we burned gridlocked cars in morse code before we took off running to say living is winning  lake shore drive reads chicago is living life city quoting the song          winning   4  the whole street     ladies lay afloat in the gondola stroll     of their own legs  the daylit lanterns of their dreams hide inexpressibly their faces made up with not being in kansas  they fan with maps like feathers of brightly colored directions to famous brands  of which this street is that one direction     and all one direction only         no movement  as if since people move there are no people on this street the stalks of the buildings reeds a hem of the lake sweeps through   5  daylight you see peoples reflections off each other fill the street cascading one from another the crowd slips like a fan out of itself  in the angling of store displays the glass facets kaleidoscope a rose window back of themselves full of the flash petals of grace  that fall by evening home when the ones dressed in evening wear        possessionless and so without reflection here        take all the empties back  all the want and people scavenged back off the streets     into these who dine with starving    off the streets   6  the street in the opening between buildings is running a strip of the el like a frame by frame tape the windows of the train different shots of the sky then it breaks  and the clouds are caught up in the walls of nearby glassskin architecture i never get to see what i think would be the whole movie i too move on  the turns in the drive roll the buildings out from behind one another in a scenery change only i am the one on wheels the drop backs a larger stage than this town  and just as i can see betrayal coming by the music my eyes braille the thunder hidden even up the sleeve of a silent film the hand shakes anyway not meant  to be the end of things an inbound train toward the loop will be arriving shortly the street in the opening   7  the john hancock building has never struck the actual oil it looks like it should wildcatters call this a dry hole but it isnt it has the pool of lake michigan  on the bottom when youre looking from the top what an amazing hole he said enchantments name to call into      what we all are looking for a spell to an opening as deep     into seeing  he had the gift of new    first time in a city pick pockets hadnt sighted yet the eyes the bulging wealth of openness the shiny change we were watching the old movie of our century  our village root the wells drawnwords drip into volumes in our pack trying to solve our plot a closeup on the winchrope frayed by so continuously raising the question  cuts off    not to mislead the viewer and screened on our bodies the billboard buses city wall the crude that is this day struck from our drilling   8  all over everything    the sun rises funny i heard the eagle flies on friday as the eagle shits on friday where i lived not enough for any growth to get paid  its flowers mostly weed bouquet of distraction broken glass season gives way to plastic in the lots only the packaging changes it snows something or other year round  white to deal with powder or rock or through the window the country unable to stop opening its poverties making the sun go round to the back but the sun reserves its someday  someday to shine where door don llow light and i am drenched by a slow barely brought in gusher of my working through the cracks a gold opened in myself like a vein through  blinding pain through the names of need and silence but my someday come seems didnt when the hit is only mine not also enough of  to my brothers   9  dawn burnished wave        smoothed free of everything but the slowest curve barely less than earths  hump      unloads a surfless silence we can see  clear bright yet shimmeringstillness as   stillness as a dangerous surface enough a floor walked all night clear to the end of nowhere                     got to get my hands on some no place          except where money from somewhere to get me over this hump an arm swipes everything off the table to this floor        the hit

 this year till late in april the snow fell thick and light thy truceflag friendly nature in clinging drifts of white hung over field and city now everywhere is seen in place of that white quietness a sudden glow of green  the verdure climbs the common beneath the leafless trees to where the glorious stars and stripes are floating on the breeze there suddenly as spring awoke from winter’s snowdraped gloom the passionflower of seventysix is bursting into bloom  dear is the time of roses when earth to joy is wed and gardenplot and meadow wear one generous flush of red but now in dearer beauty to her ancient colors true blooms the old town of boston in red and white and blue  along the whole awakening north are those bright emblems spread a summer noon of patriotism is burning overhead no party badges flaunting now no word of clique or clan but “up for god and union” is the shout of every man  oh peace is dear to northern hearts our hardearned homes more dear but freedom is beyond the price of any earthly cheer and freedom’s flag is sacred he who would work it harm let him although a brother beware our strong right arm  a brother ah the sorrow the anguish of that word the fratricidal strife begun when will its end be heard not this the boon that patriot hearts have prayed and waited for we loved them and we longed for peace but they would have it war  yes war on this memorial day the day of lexington a lightningthrill along the wires from heart to heart has run brave men we gazed on yesterday today for us have bled again is massachusetts blood the first for freedom shed  to warand with our brethren thenif only this can be life hangs as nothing in the scale against dear liberty though hearts be torn asunder for freedom we will fight our blood may seal the victory but god will shield the right

 these ghost soldiers live underground with the vast oversupply of castoff lanterns if one were to take broadsword to one of these  orangebearded mammoth men of rough hew he would laugh at the passing metal make light of entrails  for years i have been here without a clear map that hopes should dim as days go on above is natural i suppose what do i know  i am dressed like one of them the thick walls quake but stay soundproof i fear my fists vestigial  these soldiers’ own panic is taking up rugs finding filigrees of the former world beneath eg a locket with their mongrel’s mush  they will freeze then feign noncom smacking barrels of burgundy with pistol butts i react comme squirrel fleeing their reach to the chamber out of the impact area  one loved me until i asked if he worried about what must be happening without us well his lips did narrow hand abandoned my knee blah blah big mouth were his departing words  i will not say with shame that i came from nothing someone paved my first breakthrough at least  one time calling it love and i will stand by that as it applies to my primary makeup

 i tonight i look thunderstruck at the gold head of my grandchild almost asleep he buries his feet between my thighs his little straw eyes close in the near dark i smell the warmth of his raw slightly foul breath the new death waiting to rot inside him our breaths equalize our heartbeats every muscle of the chest uncoils the arm bones loosen in the nest of nerves i think of the peace of walking through the house pointing to the name of this the name of that an educator of a new man  mother grandmother wise snakewoman who will show the way spiderwoman whose black tentacles hold him precious or will tear off his head her teeth over the little husband the small fist clotted in trust at her breast  this morning looking at the face of his father i remembered how an infant his face was too dark nose too broad mouth too wide i did not look in that mirror and see the face that could save me from my own darkness did he looking in my eye see what i turned from my own dark grandmother bending over gladioli in the field her shaking black hand defenseless at the shining cock of flower  i wanted that face to die to be reborn in the face of a white child  i wanted the soul to stay the same for i loved to death to damnation and goddeath the soul that broke out of me i crowed my son my beautiful but when i peeked in the basket i saw the face of a black man  did i bend over his nose and straighten it with my fingers like a vine growing the wrong way did he feel my hand in malice  generations we prayed and fucked for this light child the shining god of the second coming we bow down in shame and carry the children of the past in our wallets begging forgiveness  ii a picture in a book a lynching the bland faces of men who watch a christ go up in flames smiling as if he were a hooked fish a felled antelope some wild thing tied to boards and burned his charring body gives off lighta halo burns out of him his face scorched featureless the hair matted to the scalp like feathers one man stands with his hand on his hip another with his arm slung over the shoulder of a friend as if this moment were large enough to hold affection  iii how can we wake from a dream we are born into that shines around us the terrible bright air  having awakened having seen our own bloody hands how can we ask forgiveness bring before our children the real monster of their nightmares  the worst is true everything you did not want to know

 october 18 1914 i dreamt that people from the land of chimes arrived one autumn morning with their bells to hoist them on the towers and citadels of my own country that the musical rhymes  rung by them into space at meted times amid the markets daily stir and stress and the nights empty starlit silentness might solace souls of this and kindred climes  then i awoke and lo before me stood the visioned ones but pale and full of fear from bruges they came and antwerp and ostend  no carillons in their train foes of mad mood had shattered these to shards amid the gear of ravaged roof and smouldering gableend

 1916 i   i found a dreadful acre of the dead marked with the only sign on earth that saves the wings of death were hurrying overhead the loose earth shook on those unquiet graves  for the deep gunpits with quick stabs of flame made their own thunders of the sunlit air yet as i read the crosses name by name rank after rank it seemed that peace was there  sunlight and peace a peace too deep for thought the peace of tides that underlie our strife the peace with which the moving heavens are fraught the peace that is our everlasting life  the loose earth shook the very hills were stirred the silence of the dead was all i heard ii   we who lie here have nothing more to pray to all your praises we are deaf and blind we may not ever know if you betray our hope to make earth better for mankind  only our silence in the night shall grow more silent as the stars grow in the sky and while you deck our graves you shall not know how many scornful legions pass you by  for we have heard you say when we were living that some small dream of good would “cost too much” but when the foe struck we have watched you giving and seen you move the mountains with one touch  what can be done we know but have no fear if you fail now we shall not see or hear

 have you seen have you seen magic shadows  fleetwood mac “nightwatch” my fugues have no apparent relation to past trauma of any kind when it came time to rehearse we decided to get glamorous we get all doneup for rehearsal gradually imperceptibly things begin slipping back into their normal place my body is slowly rotating into its proper northsouth orientation my playing is flawless as it turns out the audience goes nuts but what was it all about had i longer to see the aspects and facets of the family which as we know are not always ticketyboo but i have drifted away like a widewinged bird over many things that are meaningless yet my mind is clicking away quite properly on other levels i was never in it for the money but i see where it goes without ever touching it  it was like a honeymoon  nothing made sense sounding utterly convincing to my own ears  selfness in training needing a month of good sleep when i woke i saw the sunlight streaming in across the ceiling and thought oh boy we were awful yesterday the obvious response being to phone the boss and tell him you’re sick and go to bed until it’s passed except boss is in bed too don’t let the lack of his spirit blind your life you would expect me to tell you wouldn’t you if our positions were reversed while i look for a suitable shirt but you don’t have any more to accomplish nothing at all did you ever love me could i grit my teeth and carry it all off without anyone being the wiser  any words that have concrete meanings are fine and completely friendly the whole history of the human race is somewhat sad wouldn’t you say if you look at it in a certain way but then if you squint a bit differently it isn’t sad at all  there were times we were all hurting really bad thinking the bed will win maybe it was the beginnings of trademark  if we stayed telepathic we couldn’t do that  surprise surprise and that’s how we decided to do the dance and that’s how the dance came about there was a large grassy clearing in the forest the trees around it thick and tall and there was sunlight on the grass we knew that people were worshipping and the way they did it was to gather around a place like this and allow themselves to become a part of it greeting it and letting it greet them feeding their bodies to their souls the pity of the tribe was how we imagined it seeing behind closed eyelids a lovely scene looking down from an open balcony into a central courtyard we were in a place that appeared to consist of baskets of flowers  i could see only the top of his brown hair and his moving hands there’s a lot of color it’s more noticeable than usual  i mean there are little prisms rainbows everywhere but whether it was guitar or piano i couldn’t tell you  this is prelindsey the back room was vicious everyone on a different drug if you turned your back you’d better keep on walking we did this every night playing country rock at the height of glitter mixedbag material we needed theoretical problems my back to him i said “you mean us poor sad little castoffs wouldn’t it be nice if we could cheer each other up so our miser wouldn’t cast a pall on the happiness of the prince and princess” only i’m foreshadowing with picky surfaces the morals are contemporary  argument of sounds accomodation implosion but still the ineffable grace of seeming perishable  the ordinariness of making love and hearing music  i’m okay by myself believe me it’s a thought that gives rise to immense selfcompassion okay i’ll deal with this i kind of went on the skids it was just the four of us finally starting to crank it out faster and faster until it was too fast then one day it was a friday always payday and i was in the bedroom beginning to sort out what i thought of as my shitpile a collection of such things as dresses belts stockings photographs and old magazines all waiting to be put where they belong

 the last time i saw donald armstrong he was staggering oddly off into the sun going down off the philippine islands i let my shovel fall and put that hand above my eyes and moved some way to one side that his body might pass through the sun  and i saw how well he was not standing there on his hands on his spindleshanked forearms balanced unbalanced with his big feet looming and waving in the great untrustworthy air he flew in each night when it darkened  dust fanned in scraped puffs from the earth between his arms and blood turned his face inside out to demonstrate its suppleness of veins as he perfected his role next day he toppled his head off on an island beach to the south  and the enemy’s twohanded sword did not fall from anyone’s hands at that miraculous sight as the head rolled over upon its wideeyed face and fell into the inadequate grave  he had dug for himself under pressure yet i put my flat hand to my eyebrows months later to see him again in the sun when i learned how he died and imagined him there come judged before his small captors  doing all his lean tricks to amaze them the back somersault the kipup and at last the stand on his hands perfect with his feet together his head down evenly breathing as the sun poured from the sea  and the headsman broke down in a blaze of tears in that light of the thin long human frame upside down in its own strange joy and if some other one had not told him would have cut off the feet  instead of the head and if armstrong had not presently risen in kingly roundshouldered attendance and then knelt down in himself beside his hacked glittering grave having done all things in this life that he could

 i don’t belong in this centurywho does in my time summer came someplace in june the cutbanks blazing with roses the birds brazen and the astonished pastures frisking with young calves    that was in the country i don’t mean another country i mean in the country and the country is lost i don’t mean just lost to me nor in the way of metaphorical lossit’s lost that way too no nor in no sort of special case i mean lost  now down below in the fire and stench the city is building its shell elaborate levels of emptiness like some seaanimal building toward its extinction and the citizens unserious and full of virtue are hunting for bread or money or a prayer and i behold them and this season of man without love  if it were not a joke it would be proper to laugh curious how that rat’s nest holds together distracting    without it there might be still the gold wheel and the silver the sun and the moon the season’s ancient assurance under the unstable stars our fiery companions    and trees perhaps and the sound of the wild and living water hurrying out of the hills  without these i have you for my talisman sun moon the four seasons the true voice of the mountains now be the city revolving in its empty shell the night moving in from the east be thou these things

 after tafisha edwards to disappear black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of black girls the disposability of black girls who are prone to disappearance a body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot absence becomes the lot of black girls   will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of black girls in what becomes the normal daytoday black girls are harder to find  would think first not that there are few attempts to find them the question isn’t whether black girls often go missing if no one else black girls miss each other    would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of black girls if  could miss what  have never been required to recognize such as  unlike missing black girls taking black girls is a western custom it seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it that black girls are quintessential american palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety  would rather forget that black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of liberty and independence would not speak that liberty and independence were imaginable only in the absentpresence of taken black girls enslaved black girls black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken black girls  the constancy of black girls is someone’s anxiety the soil is thick with hidden black girls the myth that only quiet black girls are worthwhile black girls the soil turns as   turn away from loud black girls and their cacophonic insistence on black girls   have not insisted enough upon the fact of black girls are often loudly shocked to find black girls disappeared loud unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing black girls outrage too has a way of being disappeared

 from the mithridatic wars  first century bc our general was elsewhere but we drowned while he rested he shipped us home with the bulk of  his spoils that had weighed his army down the thrashing storm that caught us cracked the hulls and made us offerings to the sea floor  a rain of statues gold and men  released from service done with war the crash and hiss muted we fell through streams of creatures whose lives were their purpose we settled with treasure looted from temples of rubbled athenian greece among us bronze and marble gods and goddesses moored without grace dodged by incurious fish their power was never meant to buoy us  our pleasures were incidental gifts  but shaken by their radiance in our dust we had given them our voices  their faces wings and limbs lie here with our sanded bones and motionless devices little crabs attempt to don rings set with agate and amethyst and many an octopus seeking an hour of rest finds shelter in our braincases so we are still of use

 perhaps you covet something of its emptiness its uselessness  in matters of  yearning or feeling another’s yearn that it can’t  know a damn thing yet damns everything it touches the water  it gathers along its passage the air it pushes through  swallowlike it is no bird though you envy the song  you hear only after it’s gone even if  it sings through paper  a goat the neck of a man wearing a scarf that tufts just as  the rest of   him flies out of his shoes and collapses in dirt  or how it is like the dirt receiving him the privilege  of not knowing if   he was kind or unkind as you  chamber another waiting for someone to come for his shoes

 “died of wounds” because you died i shall not rest again but wander ever through the lone world wide seeking the shadow of a dream grown vain because you died  i shall spend brief and idle hours beside the many lesser loves that still remain but find in none my triumph and my pride  and disillusions slow corroding stain will creep upon each quest but newly tried for every striving now shall nothing gain because you died

 i gave birth to a princess her mother once told me and i thought of my son pouring his grapenuts in the garage so as not to wake her  of the moment her baby seeing her now a separate entity seemed not to breathe refused to blink her sapphire eyes  i remembered again last night as she and i crossed a florida street the caution light running gold streamers  over the dark sweep of her hair when a young man coming toward us halted midway a moment stunned before moving on  so what is this divine rightless than bloodlines or more more than symmetry of face or a silver necklace nestled  at a flawless throat the nerve to send back bad food in restaurants more than the big loopy handwriting of the generous spirit  call it bravery that eager readiness in the eyes the quality of the light shining there call it blessed assurance  today ponytailed she luxuriates in sun opulent in a hot pink bikini in deference the ocean leans away a backdrop  i find myself bent studying the shore for perfect shells to lay at her feetcats paw prickly cockle angel wing call it homage more or less

 your hands have no more worth than tree stumps at harvest don’t sit on my porch while i make myself useful braid secrets in scalps on summer days for my sisters secure every strand of gossip with tight rubber bands of value what possessed you to ever grow your nails so long how can you have history without braids  a black girl is happiest when rooted to the scalp are braids she dances with them whipping down her back like corn in winds of harvest braiding forces our reunions to be like the shifts your mothers work long i find that being surrounded by only your own is more useful gives our mixed blood more value solidifies your place with your race with your sisters  your block is a layered cake of your sisters force your lips quiet and sweet and they’ll speak when they need to practice braids your hair length is the only part of you that holds value the tallest crop is worshipped at harvest so many little hands in your head you are finally useful your hair is yours your hair is theirs your hair is for a black girl long  tenderheaded ass won’t last ’round here long cut your nails and use your fists to protect yourself against your sisters somehow mold those hands useful you hair won’t get pulled in fights if they are in braids beat out the weak parts of the crops during harvest when they are limp and without soul they have value  if you won’t braid or defend yourself what is your value sitting on the porch until dark sweeps in needing to be invited you’ll be needing long when the crop is already used what is its worth after harvest you’ll learn that you can’t ever trust those quick to call themselves your sisters they yearn for the gold that is your braids you hold on your shoulders a coveted item that is useful  your presence will someday become useful one day the rest of your body will stagger under the weight of its value until then sit in silence in the front with your scalp on fire from the braids i promise you won’t need anyone too long one day you will love yourself on your own without the validation of sisters no longer a stump wailing for affection at harvest

 “speak speak thou fearful guest who with thy hollow breast still in rude armor drest comest to daunt me wrapt not in eastern balms but with thy fleshless palms stretched as if asking alms why dost thou haunt me”  then from those cavernous eyes pale flashes seemed to rise as when the northern skies gleam in december and like the water’s flow under december’s snow came a dull voice of woe from the heart’s chamber  “i was a viking old my deeds though manifold no skald in song has told no saga taught thee take heed that in thy verse thou dost the tale rehearse else dread a dead man’s curse for this i sought thee  “far in the northern land by the wild baltic’s strand i with my childish hand tamed the gerfalcon and with my skates fastbound skimmed the halffrozen sound that the poor whimpering hound trembled to walk on  “oft to his frozen lair tracked i the grisly bear while from my path the hare fled like a shadow oft through the forest dark followed the werewolf’s bark until the soaring lark sang from the meadow  “but when i older grew joining a corsair’s crew o’er the dark sea i flew with the marauders wild was the life we led many the souls that sped many the hearts that bled by our stern orders  “many a wassailbout wore the long winter out often our midnight shout set the cocks crowing as we the berserk’s tale measured in cups of ale draining the oaken pail filled to o’erflowing  “once as i told in glee tales of the stormy sea soft eyes did gaze on me burning yet tender and as the white stars shine on the dark norway pine on that dark heart of mine fell their soft splendor  “i wooed the blueeyed maid yielding yet half afraid and in the forest’s shade our vows were plighted under its loosened vest fluttered her little breast like birds within their nest by the hawk frighted  “bright in her father’s hall shields gleamed upon the wall loud sang the minstrels all chanting his glory when of old hildebrand i asked his daughter’s hand mute did the minstrels stand to hear my story  “while the brown ale he quaffed loud then the champion laughed and as the windgusts waft the seafoam brightly so the loud laugh of scorn out of those lips unshorn from the deep drinkinghorn blew the foam lightly  “she was a prince’s child i but a viking wild and though she blushed and smiled i was discarded should not the dove so white follow the seamew’s flight why did they leave that night her nest unguarded  “scarce had i put to sea bearing the maid with me fairest of all was she among the norsemen when on the white seastrand waving his armed hand saw we old hildebrand with twenty horsemen  “then launched they to the blast bent like a reed each mast yet we were gaining fast when the wind failed us and with a sudden flaw came round the gusty skaw so that our foe we saw laugh as he hailed us  “and as to catch the gale round veered the flapping sail ‘death’ was the helmsman’s hail ‘death without quarter’ midships with iron keel struck we her ribs of steel down her black hulk did reel through the black water  “as with his wings aslant sails the fierce cormorant seeking some rocky haunt with his prey laden  so toward the open main beating to sea again through the wild hurricane bore i the maiden  “three weeks we westward bore and when the storm was o’er cloudlike we saw the shore stretching to leeward there for my lady’s bower built i the lofty tower which to this very hour stands looking seaward  “there lived we many years time dried the maiden’s tears she had forgot her fears she was a mother death closed her mild blue eyes under that tower she lies ne’er shall the sun arise on such another  “still grew my bosom then still as a stagnant fen hateful to me were men the sunlight hateful in the vast forest here clad in my warlike gear fell i upon my spear oh death was grateful  “thus seamed with many scars bursting these prison bars up to its native stars my soul ascended there from the flowing bowl deep drinks the warrior’s soul skoal to the northland skoal” thus the tale ended

 for my wife after the storm after the rain stopped pounding we stood in the doorway watching horses walk off lazily across the pasture’s hill we stared through the black screen our vision altered by the distance so i thought i saw a mist kicked up around their hooves when they faded like cutout horses away from us the grass was never more blue in that light more scarlet beyond the pasture trees scraped their voices into the wind branches crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire but you said they were only branches  okay the storm stopped pounding i am trying to say this straight for once i was sane enough to pause and breathe outside my wild plans and after the hard rain i turned my back on the old curses i believed they swung finally away from me   but still the branches are wire and thunder is the pounding mortar still i close my eyes and see the girl running from her village napalm stuck to her dress like jelly her hands reaching for the no one who waits in waves of heat before her  so i can keep on living so i can stay here beside you i try to imagine she runs down the road and wings beat inside her until she rises above the stinking jungle and her pain eases and your pain and mine  but the lie swings back again the lie works only as long as it takes to speak and the girl runs only as far as the napalm allows until her burning tendons and crackling muscles draw her up into that final position  burning bodies so perfectly assume nothing can change that she is burned behind my eyes and not your good love and not the rainswept air and not the jungle green pasture unfolding before us can deny it

 bath  the day is freshwashed and fair and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air the sunshine pours in at the bathroom window and bores through the water in the bathtub in lathes and planes of greenishwhite it cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel and cracks it to bright light little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance dance and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling a stir of my finger sets them whirring reeling i move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar i lie back and laugh and let the greenwhite water the sunflawed beryl water flow over me the day is almost too bright to bear the green water covers me from the too bright day i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots the sky is blue and high a crow flaps by the window and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air  breakfast table  in the freshwashed sunlight the breakfast table is decked and white it offers itself in flat surrender tendering tastes and smells and colours and metals and grains and the white cloth falls over its side draped and wide wheels of white glitter in the silver coffeepot hot and spinning like catherinewheels they whirl and twirland my eyes begin to smart the little white dazzling wheels prick them like darts placid and peaceful the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask a stack of butterpats pyramidal shout orange through the white scream flutter call “yellow yellow yellow” coffee steam rises in a stream clouds the silver teaservice with mist and twists up into the sunlight revolved involuted suspiring higher and higher fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky a crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam the day is new and fair with good smells in the air  walk  over the street the white clouds meet and sheer away without touching on the sidewalks boys are playing marbles glass marbles with amber and blue hearts roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise the boys strike them with black and red striped agates the glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water i smell tulips and narcissus in the air but there are no flowers anywhere only white dust whipping up the street and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts the dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat highheeled patent leather shoes tap tap the little heels pat the pavement and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat a watercart crawls slowly on the other side of the way it is green and gay with new paint and rumbles contentedly sprinkling clear water over the white dust clear zigzagging water which smells of tulips and narcissus the thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky whoop the clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time whoop and a man’s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust leaps into the branches of a tree veers away and trundles ahead of the wind jarring the sunlight into spokes of rosecolour and green a motorcar cuts a swathe through the bright air sharpbeaked irresistible shouting to the wind to make way a glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it and settles down the sky is quiet and high and the morning is fair with freshwashed air  midday and afternoon  swirl of crowded streets shock and recoil of traffic the stockstill brick façade of an old church against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw flare of sunshine down sidestreets eddies of light in the windows of chemists’ shops with their blue gold purple jars darting colours far into the crowd loud bangs and tremors murmurings out of high windows whirring of machine belts blurring of horses and motors a quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car and the jar of a churchbell knocking against the metal blue of the sky i am a piece of the town a bit of blown dust thrust along with the crowd proud to feel the pavement under me reeling with feet feet tripping skipping lagging dragging plodding doggedly or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps a boy is selling papers i smell them clean and new from the press they are fresh like the air and pungent as tulips and narcissus the blue sky pales to lemon and great tongues of gold blind the shopwindows putting out their contents in a flood of flame  night and sleep  the day takes her ease in slippered yellow electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts following each other they grow and grow and blow into patterns of fireflowers as the sky fades trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night twinkle jab snap that means a new play and over the way plop drop quiver is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker’s sign with its length on another street a gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building but the sky is high and has her own stars why should she heed ours i leave the city with speed wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness the breeze which blows with me is freshwashed and clean it has come but recently from the high sky there are no flowers in bloom yet but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus my room is tranquil and friendly out of the window i can see the distant city a band of twinkling gems little flowerheads with no stems i cannot see the beerglass nor the letters of the restaurants and shops i passed now the signs blur and all together make the city glowing on a night of fine weather like a garden stirring and blowing for the spring the night is freshwashed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air wrap me close sheets of lavender pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears the breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days and cobbled streets and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways pale blue lavender you are the colour of the sky when it is freshwashed and fair    i smell the stars    they are like tulips and narcissus    i smell them in the air

 there’s something in me that likes to imagine the things i’m afraid of  for example the future i don’t mean the celestial fireworks  from melting reactors or new york under six feet of sea water but the future in its most intimate  most probable formsvignettes subversive enough to slip through the radar  that’s how i come to be crouched behind a stripped car wondering  would it be too dangerous to piss in the street it would i’m a woman  so i go on holding it distracting myself by trying to remember every fruit i’ve ever eaten  their exact textures and flavors so far the most exotic is the custard apple  i use up a whole hour of daylight and then anotherapricot blueberry plum  calves cramping from having to stay low waiting behind a car pitted  with the acne of automatic fire  there are still too many guns walking around out there and no one i know  so i’m waiting for twilight at least is everyone alone now  the wind says so it says a winter is coming without oil  it bites to get my attention and scatters a few leaflets pictures of a blackened car  a city that seems to catch on fire every sunset though there’s little enough to burn stone only chars  this isn’t a likeness of the future is it every person in the street a stranger  will a word like ‘neighbor’ survive this  i fired a gun once it smelled rancid sour like bad food it hurt my shoulder  and left a wound of oil on my shirt  my mind is thinking of sleep again sleep lets things escapemy pocketknife  vanished through a knifesized hole  there’s nothing to cut no guava nectarine winter pear  and nothing left of the car at all not even the rearview mirror i was counting on  hoping my face could tell me it was safe to go home and where is that  a place with a bed and a desk where i sit and plot next year’s garden on graph paper  the skin of a tangelo is faintly pebbly easy to peel but the sweetest citrus  is the satsuma then the clementine if i had to choose between natural disaster and a firing squad  i’d take the river of lava any day  hurricane tidal wave tornado drought i want the earth which is waiting under the sidewalk to be the one  not any of these human shadows sporting their silhouetted guns there were gun shadows before  but the two worlds overlapped guns and the amber waves of grain  it’s hard to say whether bramble fruits actually have skins does a raspberry does each tiny globe have its own  how will i live without the earth  in a stripped car unable to piss when i want to all the time cold  maybe weapons interbred with humans and a strain of hybrids was born half metal half flesh  i know there’s an enemy look at all the damage it’s doing maybe it’s still a baby  its weak neck wobbling as its carriage lurches over the broken pavement  but probably by now it’s a sulking adolescent starting to look like serious trouble  with a silky little shadowmoustache and a gun who’ll kill it will i  what if it doesn’t look like the enemy what if it comes disguised as a savior or resembles nothing so much as hunger  so that everyone has his own private piece to kill will we do it

that ronald was able to recall his hair a mess of replicas of them  as industrious as the state whose success was poultry amp eggs tobacco amp soybeans  as well as convictions  none as tightly knit as jennifer’s not even the state flag that she could identify cotton  that cotton’s taking on appearances other than burst white of a dense localized haze from which to weave memory following pinkpetaled start rather a satellite dish of a flower pollensensor studded antenna protruding from the center  undeniably the jury couldn’t acquit cotton of its role in documenting and altering jennifer’s history  many lives changed  as result of consequences sensors that boast duality of receptor and transmitter witness insects give and take taint what is put out taken in mix  it up so that interrelatedness spreads and the understandable error of metaphor becomes less erroneous over time eleven years in prison innocence locked up protected  although in prison it resembled something else if cotton strained he could see the top  of a ferris wheel on the horizon just a possible segment of a rainbow the length of a chain  of cardinal feathers  even though it wasn’t that at all the eye witnesses all the time even the unseeing eye is turned toward a focus on black saturation dense as conviction the eye  processes pulls in whole vista to a retinal speck of convergence  which is to say there is some cotton in poole some connection independent shared participation in cold beer occasional cards turkeyspread in the right hand without knowing the other sank into the seat at the cinema the same way  and sampled funnel cake at the state fair within a week of each other  and more than that in common both being men and convicted for what men really can and really do do  including sometimes confessions and apologies cash reparations  after the innocence is free to extend its parameters to unlocked doors be an oversized overzealous white bird floating down the aisle its cottony haze lifted in order to kiss and marry ronald’s calm delight in being able to take his time  leave his longshoreman’s mark on ships that take some of him to any port in the world durable goods  such as the dna whose precision detects human exactitude and could build as many ronalds as time would permit  something jennifer now desperately wants to do restoring what was lost because it was like something else  because the fact of similarity is compelling convincing if connections could not be made there’d be no havens no fugitive status lost to fusion no links to god no human  murmurings whose constant echoes are also the gentle silvery hum of fans praying over computer motors to cool them and also mimic motion of small wings amplified to make sound  in the distance much like the electric razor preparing a head on death row clean as a light bulb   ronald was prepared to be believed he saw the quiet manner of his long days in court as evidence of his rationality and contemplativeness  such as befits clergy a potential propensity for order mercy the steadiness required to dispense blessings mostly on the undeserving without emotion or judgment selfishness or preference  while he was being judged guilty for lack of emotion for jennifer’s incontrovertible emotional insistence on cotton’s being the oneshe had to finger him to be comfortable within her survival no way to mistake to ever forget details documented in memory the event relived to the point that it resculpted her brain into a cottony bust he was there to be the perfect model  whose reality floated away in a poole as only the reflection of cotton  identified as source a situation also called musthave moonlight   here’s the new amp improved cotton eleven years in the making enough time served to anger to ruin it at that same room’s temperature it became doubt of clemency pardon peculiar butter that erupted as gratefulness for the miracle of absolute exoneration when his impossibility as rapist was proven  even cotton conceded that the composite sketch bore a just resemblance to cotton displayed a metaphor for men like cotton the seeds of capability in the structure of the face the human repertoire that includes cotton who softly consents to meet jennifer when she asks him to funnel her regret and apologies deep into himself accepting that she meant no malice toward him but toward the perpetrator whom many men resemble all brothers family  of man resemblance cotton’s own daughter cotton’s own wife could be in a similar position no offense taken captivated by the beauty of jennifer her superior logic  refusing to let the crime against her silence her as sure as certain as dazzling about speaking up about mistaking cotton for poole as she was in identifying in the lineup the closest thing there to poole the best available the incredible likeness that memory seized filling gaps in the recollected poole with cotton’s particulars she felt better in her cotton touched skin  metaphor is a form of forgiveness a short rope of it knotsup those that can’t come together any other way into being defined by the other strange  and estranged pairings give rise to mutable truth that can yield to both dawn and twilight demands that things be seen differently   jennifer in moonlight instead of being illuminated moon whose face was also in emmett till’s way but this generation of jennifer has another side home late after a day of good faith in which she and cotton team up at a church to speak up about doubt as less a shadow than certainty  memory is as accurate as metaphor an overlay that always fits something that like the purest most sparkling water is too naïve not to submit to any vessel into which it’s poured just to be guzzled  perhaps the vessel in which cotton becomes a pool in which north carolina is shaped like an embryo  humanity still on the brink of infancy

 there is a coalblack angel with a thick afric lip and he dwells like the hunted and harried in a swamp where the green frogs dip but his face is against a city which is over a bay of the sea and he breathes with a breath that is blastment and dooms by a far decree  by night there is fear in the city through the darkness a star soareth on there’s a scream that screams up to the zenith then the poise of a meteor lone lighting far the pale fright of the faces and downward the coming is seen then the rush and the burst and the havoc and wails and shrieks between  it comes like the thief in the gloaming it comes and none may foretell the place of the comingthe glaring they live in a sleepless spell that wizens and withers and whitens it ages the young and the bloom of the maiden is ashes of roses the swamp angel broods in his gloom  swift is his messengers’ going but slowly he saps their halls as if by delay deluding they move from their crumbling walls farther and farther away but the angel sends after and after by night with the flame of his ray by night with the voice of his screaming sends after them stone by stone and farther walls fall farther portals and weed follows weed through the town  is this the proud city the scorner which never would yield the ground which mocked at the coalblack angel the cup of despair goes round  vainly she calls upon michael the white man’s seraph was he for michael has fled from his tower to the angel over the sea  who weeps for the woeful city let him weep for our guilty kind who joys at her wild despairing christ the forgiver convert his mind

 poetry wordsworth wrote will have no easy time of it when the discriminating  powers of the mind are so blunted that all voluntary exertion dies and  the general public is reduced to a state of near savage torpor morose  stuporous with no attention span whatsoever nor will the tranquil rustling  of the lyric drowned out by the heavy dull coagulation of persons in cities  where a uniformity of occupations breeds cravings for sensation which hourly visual  communication of instant intelligence gratifies like crazy likely survive this age

 the relief of putting your fingers on the keyboard as if you were walking on the beach and found a diamond as big as a shoe  as if you had just built a wooden table and the smell of sawdust was in the air your hands dry and woody  as if you had eluded the man in the dark hat who had been following you all week  the relief of putting your fingers on the keyboard playing the chords of beethoven bach chopin in an afternoon when i had no one to talk to when the magazine advertisement forms of soft sweaters and clean shining republican middleclass hair walked into carpeted houses and left me alone with bare floors and a few books  i want to thank my mother for working every day in a drab office in garages and water companies cutting the cream out of her coffee at 40 to lose weight her heavy body writing its delicate bookkeeper’s ledgers alone with no man to look at her face her body her prematurely white hair in love i want to thank my mother for working and always paying for my piano lessons before she paid the bank of america loan or bought the groceries or had our old rattling ford repaired  i was a quiet child afraid of walking into a store alone afraid of the water the sun the dirty weeds in back yards afraid of my mother’s bad breath and afraid of my father’s occasional visits home knowing he would leave again afraid of not having any money afraid of my clumsy body that i knew no one would ever love  but i played my way on the old upright piano obtained for 10 played my way through fear through ugliness through growing up in a world of dimestore purchases and a desire to love a loveless world  i played my way through an ugly face and lonely afternoons days evenings nights mornings even empty as a rusty coffee can played my way through the rustles of spring and wanted everything around me to shimmer like the narrow tide on a flat beach at sunset in southern california i played my way through an empty father’s hat in my mother’s closet and a bed she slept on only one side of never wrinkling an inch of the other side waiting waiting  i played my way through honors in school the only place i could talk the classroom or at my piano lessons mrs hillhouse’s canary always singing the most for my talents as if i had thrown some part of my body away upon entering her house and was now searching every ivory case of the keyboard slipping my fingers over black ridges and around smooth rocks wondering where i had lost my bloody organs or my mouth which sometimes opened like a california poppy wide and with contrasts beautiful in sweeping fields entirely closed morning and night  i played my way from age to age but they all seemed ageless or perhaps always old and lonely wanting only one thing surrounded by the dusty bittersmelling leaves of orange trees wanting only to be touched by a man who loved me who would be there every night to put his large strong hand over my shoulder whose hips i would wake up against in the morning whose mustaches might brush a face asleep dreaming of pianos that made the sound of mozart and schubert without demanding that life suck everything out of you each day without demanding the emptiness of a timid little life  i want to thank my mother for letting me wake her up sometimes at 6 in the morning when i practiced my lessons and for making sure i had a piano to lay my school books down on every afternoon i haven’t touched the piano in 10 years perhaps in fear that what little love i’ve been able to pick like lint out of the corners of pockets will get lost slide away into the terribly empty cavern of me if i ever open it all the way up again love is a man with a mustache gently holding me every night always being there when i need to touch him he could not know the painfully loud music from the past that his loving stops from pounding banging battering through my brain which does its best to destroy the precarious gray matter when i am alone he does not hear mrs hillhouse’s canary singing for me liking the sound of my lesson this week telling me confirming what my teacher says that i have a gift for the piano few of her other pupils had when i touch the man i love i want to thank my mother for giving me piano lessons all those years keeping the memory of beethoven a deaf tortured man in mind of the beauty that can come from even an ugly past

 once i tried to banish them all from my writing this was america after all where everyone’s at liberty to remake her person her place or her poetry  and i lived in a town a long way from everything where discussions of “diversity” centered mainly on sexuality  my policy born of exhaustion with talk about race and the quintessentially american wish for antecedents eliminated most of my family starting with the grandparents  two of whom stayed chinese to their final days two of whom were all but defined by their expertise on the food of the country i was trying to excise  it canceled out the expensive center of an intense undergraduate curriculum and excluded the only foreign language i could talk in  it wiped out my parents’ earliest years and converted them to 1950s georgians who’d always attended church and school like anyone  my father had never paused at two water fountains and asked a white man which he should drink from and never told his children what the answer had been  my mother had never arranged a migration solo at seventeen from taipei to wherever but had simply appeared in gainesville out of ether  and nothing about their original languages had brought them together their children had never needed to explain to anyone  why distinctness and mystery were not advantages when they were not optional and never wondered if particular features had caused particular failures  for months i couldn’t write anything decent because banned information kept trying to enter like bungled idioms in the speech of a foreigner  i was my own totalitarian government an hmo that wouldn’t pay for a specialist and i was the dissident or patient who perished  the hope was to transcend the profanity of being through the dissolution of description and story which i thought might turn out to be secondary  to a semimystical state of unseeing but everywhere i went there was circumstance all of it strangely tainted by my very presence

them hunting was good in my time many felt the pellet the rest circle aimlessly or go mad in the shelters  don’t talk to me about the nightingale or the lark or the little wagtail inscribing figures with his tail in the light i don’t know much about houses i know they have their own nature nothing else new at first like babies who play in gardens with the tassels of the sun they embroider coloured shutters and shining doors over the day when the architect’s finished they change they frown or smile or even grow resentful with those who stayed behind with those who went away with others who’d come back if they could or others who disappeared now that the world’s become an endless hotel  i don’t know much about houses i remember their joy and their sorrow sometimes when i stop to think again sometimes near the sea in naked rooms with a single iron bed and nothing of my own watching the evening spider i imagine that someone is getting ready to come that they dress him up in white and black robes with manycoloured jewels and around him venerable ladies grey hair and dark lace shawls talk softly that he is getting ready to come and say goodbye to me or that a woman

‘listen there’s this too in the moonlight the statues sometimes bend like reeds in the midst of ripe fruit  the statues and the flame becomes a cool oleander the flame that burns one i mean’   ‘its just the light   shadows of the night’   ‘maybe the night that split open a blue pomegranate a dark breast and filled you with stars cleaving time and yet the statues bend sometimes dividing desire in two like a peach and the flame becomes a kiss on the limbs then a sob then a cool leaf carried off by the wind they bend they become light with a human weight you don’t forget it’   ‘the statues are in the museum’   ‘no they pursue you why can’t you see it i mean with their broken limbs with their shape from another time a shape you don’t recognize yet know it’s as though in the last days of your youth you loved a woman who was still beautiful and you were always afraid as you held her naked at noon of the memory aroused by your embrace were afraid the kiss might betray you to other beds now of the past which nevertheless could haunt you so easily so easily and bring to life images in the mirror bodies once alive their sensuality it’s as though returning home from some foreign country you happen to open an old trunk that’s been locked up a long time and find the tatters of clothes you used to wear on happy occasions at festivals with manycoloured lights mirrored now becoming dim and all that remains is the perfume of the absence of a young form really those statues are not the fragments you yourself are the relic they haunt you with a strange virginity at home at the office at receptions for the celebrated in the unconfessed terror of sleep they speak of things you wish didn’t exist or would happen years after your death and that’s difficult because  ’   ‘the statues are in

a drop of blood familiar voices but i couldn’t distinguish one from the other and then the voice of the old man reached me i felt it falling into the heart of day quietly as though motionless ‘and if you condemn me to drink poison i thank you your law will be my law how can i go wandering from one foreign country to another a rolling stone i prefer death whose path is for the better only god knows’  countries of the sun yet you cannot face the sun countries of men yet you cannot face man  the light  as the years go by the judges who condemn you grow in number as the years go by and you converse with fewer voices you see the sun with different eyes you know that those who stayed behind were deceiving you the delirium of flesh the lovely dance that ends in nakedness it’s as though turning at night into an empty highway you suddenly see the eyes of an animal shine eyes already gone so you feel your own eyes you gaze at the sun then you’re lost in darkness the doric chiton that swayed like the mountains when your fingers touched it is a marble figure in the light but its head is in darkness and those who abandoned the stadium to take up arms struck the obstinate marathon runner and he saw the track sail in blood the world empty like the moon the gardens of victory wither you see them in the sun behind the sun and the boys who dived from the bowsprits go like spindles twisting still naked bodies plunging into black light with a coin between the teeth swimming still while the sun with golden needles sews sails and wet wood and colours of the sea even now they’re going down obliquely toward the pebbles on the sea floor white oilflasks  light angelic and black laughter of waves on the sea’s highways tearstained laughter the old suppliant sees you as he moves to cross the invisible fields  light mirrored in his blood the blood that gave birth to eteocles and polynices day angelic and black the brackish taste of woman that poisons the prisoner emerges from the wave a cool branch adorned with drops sing little antigone sing o sing   i’m not speaking to you about things past i’m speaking about love adorn your hair with the sun’s thorns dark girl the heart of the scorpion has set the tyrant in man has fled and all the daughters of the sea nereids graeae hurry toward the shimmering of the rising goddess whoever has never loved will love in the light and you find yourself in a large house with many windows open running from room to room not knowing from where to look out first because the pine trees will vanish and the mirrored mountains and the chirping of birds the sea will empty shattered glass from north and south your eyes will empty of the light of day the way the cicadas all together suddenly fall silent   poros ‘galini’ 31 october 1946

fluid and fluctuating a hot rainand freeze again to red slippers myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window  they balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a windpocket they flatten out heelless like july ponds flared and burnished by red rockets  snap snap they are crackersparks of scarlet in

 you slow down to watch cumulus clouds stream across the sky you choose a more circuitous route home and pass a tree with white bags tied around random apples the apples remind you of clouds how each hangs in the sky singular yet part of a flock each item in the flock is a coordinate of earth and sky enumerating space the flocks of apples and clouds are actual infinities an endless collection of discrete items that one can conceivably count to the end this is different from potential infinity which is the entirety of infinity an immeasurable continuum that is greater than the sum of its parts after your first glimpse you are lonely for more contraction of space around the light of your mind contemplating what cannot be conceived what cannot be conceived this morning the army has found the larynx of an iraqi man that american soldiers slowly strangled to death his ribs additional evidence for the trial are still missing they are in a refrigerator in washington dc these are discrete items whereas how the passage of time felt as the soldiers strangled him is a continuum of infinite pain and his words and songs and prayers and curses he will never speak are an empty set

 branching the way blind fingers splay across the face they’re reading trees trace the backyard ditch sop that their shadows drop off into space an abyss where i hear a neighbor boy’s voice cursing an exhilarated out of its mind  unappeasably inventive flow of “fuck fuck motherfuck” ecstasy that maybe he imagines the neighborhood cant hear or is his tongue wired to some source of inspired but as yet unknown intelligence that radiates from all of us and he  is its mouthpiece speaking it to the trees that screen him from me listening to his unrelenting arias predestined like birdsong flowing unbidden of fourletter almost erotic keening over something i know too  everybody knows and even if all it is is the “fuck fuck motherfuck” ecstasy of april budding in his mouth and sending down roots to some antiself that sprouts and shadows him as it croons and shouts the song of its difference  even then this billy whom i don’t think twice about when we meet in the alley and slap palms or i see him playing alone on the swings of big kids’ slide even then is he the vessel of some signal that uses us down in the abyss irradiating him so that just this instant  whatever that other uses him for he can’t resist his voice an instrument of blissedout torment until that grip flings him loose who knows which of us it chooses to penetrate next making us suddenly sweat or shiver  that influence bathing everything budding in profane rays

 the whole trick of this thing        is to get out of your own light  marianne faithfull she said she sang very close to the mike to change the space and i changed the space by striding down the boulevard raspail at dusk in tight jeans until an algerian engineer plucked the pen from my back pocket as if you’re inside my head and you’re hearing the song from in there he came from the desert i came from green suburbs we understood nothing of one another over glasses of metallic red wine i was playing girl he played man several plots were afoot all misfiring one had to do with my skimpy black shirt and light hair his broad shoulders and hunger after months on an oil rig another was untranslatable apollinaire burned his fingers on june’s smoldering lyre but i had lost my pen the engineer read only construction manuals his room was dim and narrow and no the story didn’t slide that way though there are many ways to throw oneself away one singer did it by living by a broken wall until she shredded her voice but still she offered each song she said like an appalachian artifact like trash along the riverbank chafing at the quay plastic bottles a torn shirt fractured dolls through which the current chortles an intimate tune

 from an epigram by plato when i was a boy a relative asked for me a job at the weeks cemetery think of all i could have raised that summer that money and me living at home fattening and getting ready to live my life out on my knees humming kneading up docks and sumac from those flawless clerksatcourt those beautiful grocers and judges the polished dead of whom we make so much  i could have stayed there with them cheap too imagine never to have turned wholly away from the classic cold the hill so laid out measure by seemly measure clipped and mown by old man albright the sexton that would have been a hell of a way to make a living  thank you no i am going to take my last nourishment of measure from a dark blue ripple on swell on ripple that makes its own garlands my dead are the secret wine jars of tyrian commercial travelers their happiness is a lost beginning their graves drift in and out of the mediterranean  one of these days the immortals clinging to a beam of sunlight under water delighted by delicate crustaceans will dance up thirtyfoot walls of radiance and waken the sea shining on their shoulders the fresh wine in their arms their ships have drifted away they are stars and snowflakes floating down into your hands love

 you cant argue beautys not an accident the particular heft and angle of a chromosomes spin a tarted spangle bright lanyard twist the slip of cells weighting this boat uneven from stern to prow were all  skittery as marbles on  a marble floor beauty stays then goes it fades we say something about years and sun the nights we slept in makeup and left mascara like ashes on the pillowcase we burned  through every one of our dreams i wasnt always a stepmother you know there were whole years when i was a girl but now these ladies sell me moisturizer stand close in their lab coats pretending at science  in a fog of perfume they wield a contour brush and my cheekbone pops the magic settles uneasy it turns out fairy dust was always fake and the lipsticks made from beetles shells crushed vermillion  my color is fleshpot they say its folie or fixation its wilderness its artificial earth they cant quite make themselves care well waste it they know whatever weve been given

 i’m not yet comfortable with the word its short clean woosh that sounds like life at dinner last night my single girls said in admonition “it’s not wifeapproved” about a friend’s upcoming trip their eyes rolled up and over and out their pretty young heads wife why does it sound like a job “i need a wife” the famous feminist wrote “a wife that will keep my clothes clean ironed mended replaced if need be” a word that could be made easily into maid a wife that does fixes soothes honors obeys housewife fishwife bad wife good wife what’s the word for someone who stares long into the morning unable to even fix tea some days the kettle steaming over loud like a train whistle she who cries in the mornings she who tears a hole in the earth and cannot stop grieving the one who wants to love you but often isn’t good at even that the one who doesn’t want to be diminished by how much she wants to be yours

 husband today could you and i behold the sun that brought us to our bridal morn rising so splendid in the winter sky we though fair spring returned when we were wed could the shades vanish from these fifteen years which stand like columns guarding the approach to that great temple of the double soul that is as one – would you turn back my dear and for the sake of love’s mysterious dream as old as adam and as sweet as eve take me as i took you and once more go towards that goal which none of us have reached contesting battles which but prove a loss the victor vanquished by the wounded one teaching each other sacrifice of self true immolation to the marriage bond learning the joys of birth the woe of death leaving in chaos all the hopes of life heartbroken yet with courage pressing on for fame and fortune artists needing both or would you rather – i will acquiesce since we must choose what is and are grown gray stay in life’s desert watch our setting sun calm as those statues in egyptian sands hand clasping hand with patience and with peace wait for a future which contains no past

 the ancient songs pass deathward mournfully  cold lips that sing no more and withered wreaths regretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings symbols of ancient songs mournfully passing down to the great white surges watched of none           save the frail seabirds and the lithe pale girls daughters of okeanos  and the songs pass from the green land which lies upon the waves as a leaf on the flowers of hyacinth and they pass from the waters the manifold winds and the dim moon and they come silently winging through soft kimmerian dusk to the quiet level lands that she keeps for us all that she wrought for us all for sleep in the silver days of the earths dawning proserpine daughter of zeus  and we turn from the kuprians breasts and we turn from thee phoibos apollon and we turn from the music of old and the hills that we loved and the meads and we turn from the fiery day and the lips that were oversweet for silently brushing the fields with redshod feet with purple robe searing the flowers as with a sudden flame death thou hast come upon us  and of all the ancient songs passing to the swallowblue halls by the dark streams of persephone this only remains that in the end we turn to thee death that we turn to thee singing one last song  o death thou art an healing wind that blowest over white flowers atremble with dew thou art a wind flowing over long leagues of lonely sea thou art the dusk and the fragrance thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling thou art the pale peace of one satiate with old desires thou art the silence of beauty and we look no more for the morning we yearn no more for the sun since with thy white hands death thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets the slim colorless poppies which in thy garden alone softly thou gatherest  and silently and with slow feet approaching and with bowed head and unlit eyes we kneel before thee and thou leaning towards us caressingly layest upon us flowers from thy thin cold hands and smiling as a chaste woman knowing love in her heart thou sealest our eyes and the illimitable quietude comes gently upon us

 now winter downs the dying of the year and night is all a settlement of snow from the soft street the rooms of houses show a gathered light a shapen atmosphere like frozenover lakes whose ice is thin and still allows some stirring down within  i’ve known the wind by water banks to shake the late leaves down which frozen where they fell and held in ice as dancers in a spell fluttered all winter long into a lake graved on the dark in gestures of descent they seemed their own most perfect monument  there was perfection in the death of ferns which laid their fragile cheeks against the stone a million years great mammoths overthrown composedly have made their long sojourns like palaces of patience in the gray and changeless lands of ice and at pompeii  the little dog lay curled and did not rise but slept the deeper as the ashes rose and found the people incomplete and froze the random hands the loose unready eyes of men expecting yet another sun to do the shapely thing they had not done  these sudden ends of time must give us pause we fray into the future rarely wrought save in the tapestries of afterthought more time more time barrages of applause come muffled from a buried radio the newyear bells are wrangling with the snow

 1    in the forest of    wearisome sadness where one day i found myself wandering alone i met my heart who called to me asking me where i was going  the path was long and straight row after row of conifers receding to a horizon that because of   the geometry seemed farther than it really was like the door at the top of a staircase in versailles  but as if   the forest’s maker had been offended by elegance a pile of rocks disrupted the rows the forest once had been a field i remember that field  i was carried there by my father beside him my grandfather who planted the trees until they were tall enough to survive he mowed the field piling up rocks taking down brush with a scythe  how since i’ve known the forest almost since birth could i have been lost why since the forest is beautiful is it not a place of delight  repeatedly i asked these questions of my heart but like a good physician he elected to keep silent leaving me to answer for myself     2   late at night when i’m lying in bed and cannot sleep my heart reads to me from the romance of   pleasant thought always i’ve heard the story before and typically since the stories are true i am their hero  i’m riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where i was born because i am unsupervised i indulge in what seems at the moment a daring wish i ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler  immediately i am overcome with remorse the evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen and for the first time in my life i contemplate a lie  would my shirt dry faster if i stood in the sun where it’s hot or in the shade where cool breezes rustle the leaves  in the version of this story that appears now in the romance of pleasant thought i admire not so much my ingenuity as the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism the way i manage terror by examining how things work      3   it’s done there’s nothing more to say my heart is gone from me because he has fallen in love he has abandoned me  it’s pointless making myself uncomfortable over this by being mournful or sad it’s done there’s nothing more to say my heart is gone from me  he does nothing but mock me when i tell him pitifully that i cannot live on my own he does not listen it’s done there’s nothing more to say  after charles d’orleans

 in memory of  vic chesnutt when i walk to the mailbox holding the letter that fails to say how sorry i am you feel your call or any words at all on that day would have stopped the great singer who long ago decided more quickly through to move i notice probably because you wrote that strange word funeral the constant black fabric i think is taffeta always draped over the scaffolds the figures scraping paint are wearing dusty protective suits and to each other saying nothing i move invisibly like a breeze around three men wearing advanced practically weightless jackets impervious to all possible weather even a hurricane i hear them say something german then photograph the pale blue turrets that floating up in fog seem noble heads full of important thoughts like what revolution could make us happy from some window wandering horns he was three when i was born for a long time i had no ideas my father worked in a private office full of quiet people working i came to visit it seemed correct i went to college studied things dyed my hair felt a rage disguised as love kept escaping suffering only a few broken bones everything healed now i live in california where in some red and golden theater i saw him howl such unfathomable force from only one lung it was one of  his last shows in athens once many years ago we shared a cigarette a little smoke from our faces i can’t remember so many things but see him in his wheelchair his folded body it’s all gone but for electrons i can still push into my ears i choose the song the perfect one hear his words and see the mirror in the ancient lighthouse blinking brave ships somehow you crossed the water carrying what we need you can rest light as nothing in the harbor we will take it and go on

of time years like zombies dawdling toward a cliff edge holding back the child’s writhing body itching to grow packed around the same mind i have now  i’m sorry the concept of promise outgrew the concept of child and that systemic contradiction and wizardry left only a dim sense of suspicion a crescendoing breeze accumulating clouds amidst bewildering dichotomies  i’m sorry for resembling your relatives and captors and the man who penetrated you who’s still there communicating boldly via intersections of others’ thought waves and memories blatant into the long nights haunting  for my inferiority in the face of nuclear family culture feeding on detritus of white goods leisure sports laminate ﬂoors a real home and fake recycling  for creeping by night into a tight void blinds down brain blown glassthin electric impulses and bloated thoughts bolted in for this life being the only one my quiet mind knows  its many versions and phases i’m sorry i wasn’t your daughter  or

small movements of animals for sounds of life through a green ﬁveﬁngered haze  i’m sorry i consider sentiment fact authenticity originality when they are irrelevant so many choices in supermarkets the natural habitat of panic attacks it’s enough to make anyone sorry and i am  i’m sorry it’s taking over half a century to link your purplepatched brain scan to the basic biology of stress the piano thunders on sustain pedal wired to the facial muscles of all your neglecters aching like hell behind their stamina and machinery  i’m sorry i had logically to think of my own self ﬁrst  simultaneously navigating through the ﬁre and acid of trust and her sycophant love before returning all the powerful were women the power of penises and facial hair originated there cajoled by matriarchs  as if skin and breath were insigniﬁcant i’m so sorry where are you now to take into my arms and resuscitate is it too late given you’re ﬁfty and no longer a child  it’s always mothers and mind control which is why i thank you for breaking the cycle withstanding the enormity of generations magnetic as water to let us go you weren’t to know  about other outrageous families and sadistic counterparts a nugget of my limbic system remembered choosing my own lemonyellow baby clothes so thank you  i squeezed that into the thumbsized space in the palm of my hand knowing all along they were wrong and imploding with it  i’m sorry i wept in the shower for your canceled wedding letting the violet dress down the plughole unsure what it all meant except things staying the samefuture aggravating my brain a baby brother gone again  i’m sorry you were out there alone deﬁned by the worst of others and deﬁned by your children’s prisms of hope and survival mechanisms in one version you did marry and lived in a house with green walls and extravagant furniture  i’m sorry that consensus reality had you set ﬁre to your bed as you lay in it arrested put in a cell let off the next day because the lawyer believed it was a genuine attempt and convinced the police  i’m sorry you’ve had to withstand such torrents of  knowledgeless advice and legal toxiﬁcation clinging to reality by a sinew of tooth remembering yourself through the rough and the smooth  i’m sorry i was absent memorizing books of the bible for a bar of dairy milk owning up to things i’d never done getting conﬁrmed as an antidote to the evil core of me  i’m sorry it was exotic to think of kids like me ending up in prison coincidentally inevitably or prevented which is the same salvaged peristalsized through society brain safely contained  doused daily in cold water or electricity or disgrace temptations kept consistently far enough away as to appear illusory  like you my brave mother fantastic prodigy in ﬂowing white caftan knotted long brown hair a beautiful gaze of solemnity rare stone emotionless deﬁned by others  i’m sorry i was illprepared for your soiled mattress and comatose body under a wave of advocaat and transistor radios oozing with cheap scotch even i developed feelings for them amidst adults acting like it’s okay  to leave you this way the blue bottle ﬂies in on it inﬂated with dog shit and red hot egos

 it wasn’t the bright hems of the lord’s skirts that brushed my face and i opened my eyes to see from a cleft in rock his backside  it’s a wasp perched on my left cheek i keep my eyes closed and stand perfectly still in the garden till it leaves me alone  not to contemplate how this century ends and the next begins with no one i know having seen god but to wonder  why i get through most days unscathed though i live in a time when it might be otherwise and i grow more fatherless each day  for years now i have come to conclusions without my father’s help discovering on my own what i know what i don’t know  and seeing how one cancels the other ive become a scholar of cancellations here i stand among my father’s roses  and see that what punctures outnumbers what consoles the cruel and the tender never make peace though one climbs though one descends  petal by petal to the hidden ground no one owns i see that which is taken away by violence or persuasion  the rose announces on earth the kingdom of gravity a bird cancels it my eyelids cancel the bird anything  might cancel my eyes distance time war my father saidnever take your both eyes off of the world

 what do we do with the body do we burn it do we set it in dirt or in stone do we wrap it in balm honey oil and then gauze and tip it onto and trust it to a raft and to water  what will happen to the memory of his body if one of us doesnt hurry now and write it down fast will it be salt or late light that it melts like floss rubber gloves and a chewed cap  to a pen elsewhere how are we to regard his effects do we throw them or use them away do we say they are relics and so treat them like relics does his soiled linen count if so  would we be wrong then to wash it there are no instructions whether it should go to where are those with no linen or whether by night we should memorially wear it ourselves by day  reflect upon it folded shelved empty here on the floor behind his bed is a bent photowhy were the two of them lovers does it mean where we found it that he forgot it or lost it  or intended a safekeeping should we attempt to make contact what if this other man too is dead or alive but doesnt want to remember is human is it okay to be human and fall away  from oblation and memory if we forget and cant sometimes help it and sometimes it is all that we want how long in dawns or new cocks does that take what if it is rest and nothing else that  we want is it a findable thing small in what hole is it hidden is it maybe a country will a guide be required who will say to us how do we fly do we swim what will i do now with my hands

 sometimes up out of this land a legend begins to move is it a coming near of something under love  love is of the earth only the surface a map of roads leading wherever go miles or little bushes nod  not so the legend under fixed inexorable deep as the darkest mine the thick rocks wont tell  as fire burns the leaf and out of the green appears the vein in the center line and the legend veins under there  so the world happens twice once what we see it as second it legends itself deep the way it is

 he promises a canary dress white gloves says they’ll eat chops thick as her thighs that they’ll order doubles of the “finest” see all the big names when they arrive but it’s the thought of them dead half of what they own draped around them her head against his chest his back slack against the headboard all their letters unopened bills not paid long knocks the notices tacked outside their door it’s not knowing whether some smell would introduce them to their neighbors or a landlord wheeling them out into the hallway the highboy he chipped on the drive up the silver she inherited from her mother her hatboxes stacked high next to them like a wedding cake waiting to be buried he heard that “up there” the wind had talons sharp enough to hook a grown man beneath his collarbone and carry him a full city block he heard that you learned the months by measuring the length of their shadows and even summer was like a quality of night

 the blue booby lives on the bare rocks of galápagos and fears nothing it is a simple life they live on fish and there are few predators also the males do not make fools of themselves chasing after the young ladies rather they gather the blue objects of the world and construct from them  a nestan occasional gaulois package a string of beads a piece of cloth from a sailor’s suit this replaces the need for dazzling plumage in fact in the past fifty million years the male has grown considerably duller nor can he sing well the female though  asks little of him the blue satisfies her completely has a magical effect on her when she returns from her day of gossip and shopping she sees he has found her a new shred of blue foil for this she rewards him with her dark body the stars turn slowly in the blue foil beside them like the eyes of a mild savior

 when i think of that room i see the de kooning at the end of the hall  sometimes rain on the long windows or the tinkering of drops on the skylight  but not yvon splashing scotch into a cocktail glass  otherwise fastidious  in retrospect i should have asked her more  about the famous jazz guitarist she had been engaged to  but that much was true  even after she bought me a pocket knife sheathed in velvet  every young man needs a knife she informed her group  but in the restaurant her friends eyed me like a turnip one that talked  while she was away at her office i tried to read  her unfinished essay on the vagaries of diplomacy  reclining on a rug of embroidered storks  the two small rodins seemed misplaced  a grand piano she didn’t play  though i did affecting a controlled passion  while gazing over rooftops at carefully maintained gardens  i don’t remember her smell  i don’t recall her fingers  the last i heard she was living in barcelona  she never did learn to cook  now her letters are worth money

 my love looks like a girl tonight but she is old the plaits that lie along her pillow are not gold but threaded with filigree silver and uncanny cold  she looks like a young maiden since her brow is smooth and fair her cheeks are very smooth her eyes are closed she sleeps a rare still winsome sleep so still and so composed  nay but she sleeps like a bride and dreams her dreams of perfect things she lies at last the darling in the shape of her dream and her dead mouth sings by its shape like the thrushes in clear evenings

 an old man going a lone highway came at the evening cold and gray to a chasm vast and deep and wide through which was flowing a sullen tide the old man crossed in the twilight dim the sullen stream had no fear for him but he turned when safe on the other side and built a bridge to span the tide  “old man” said a fellow pilgrim near “you are wasting your strength with building here your journey will end with the ending day you never again will pass this way you’ve crossed the chasm deep and wide why build this bridge at evening tide”  the builder lifted his old gray head “good friend in the path i have come” he said “there followed after me today a youth whose feet must pass this way this chasm that has been as naught to me to that fairhaired youth may a pitfall be he too must cross in the twilight dim good friend i am building this bridge for him”

 and this is what is left of youth    there were two boys who were bred up together shared the same bed and fed at the same board each tried the other’s sport from their first chase young hunters of the butterfly and bee to when they followed the fleet hare and tried the swiftness of the bird they lay beside the silver trout stream watching as the sun played on the bubbles shared each in the store of either’s garden and together read of him the master of the desert isle till a low hut a gun and a canoe bounded their wishes or if ever came a thought of future days ’twas but to say that they would share each other’s lot and do wonders no doubt but this was vain they parted with promises of long remembrance words whose kindness was the heart’s and those warm tears hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them but which are thought upon in afteryears as what we would give worlds to shed once more  they met again  but different from themselves at least what each remembered of themselves the one proud as a soldier of his rank and of his many battles and the other proud of his indian wealth and of the skill and toil which gathered it each with a brow and heart alike darkened by years and care they met with cold words and yet colder looks each was changed in himself and yet each thought the other only changed himself the same and coldness bred dislike and rivalry came like the pestilence o’er some sweet thoughts that lingered yet healthy and beautiful amid dark and unkindly ones and they whose boyhood had not known one jarring word were strangers in their age if their eyes met ’twas but to look contempt and when they spoke their speech was wormwood       and this this is life

 thirteen years ago    before bulk barns    and fifth gear diesel tractors    we rode royal blue tractors with toolboxes big enough    to hold a six pack on ice in the one hundred fifteen degree    summer heat    with air    so thick with moisture you drink as you breathe before the year dusters sprayed malathion over our clustered bodies    perspiring while we primed bottom lugs those ground level leaves of tobacco and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled eightinch balls off our arms at night    and cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours before we were poisoned    and the hospital thought we had been burned in fires at least to the third degree when the raw oozing hives that covered ninetyeight percent of our bodies from the sprays ordered by the fda and spread by     landowners before anyone had seen automated machines that top and prime while we topped the lavender blooms of many tiny flowers gathered into one    gorgeous by grasping hold below the petals with our bare calloused hands and twisting downward quick hard only one time    snapped them off before edgers and herbicides took what they call weeds when we walked for days through thirty acres    and chopped them out with hoes hoes    made long before    from wood and steel and sometimes even longer ago from wood and deer scapula before the bulk primers came and we primed all the leaves by hand stooped over at the waist for the lower ones    and    through the season gradually    rising higher     until    we stood and worked simultaneously as married to the fields as we were to each other carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh leaves under each arm    and    sewing them onto sticks four feet long on a looper under the shade of a tinroofed barn    made of shingle and poking it up through the rafters inside to be caught by a hanger    who poked it up higher in the rafters    to another who held a higher position and    so    they filled the barn and the leaves hung down like butterfly wings    though sometimes the color of luna moths    or carolina parakeets    when just an hour ago    they had been laid upon    the old wooden cart trailers pulled behind the orange allischalmers tractor with huge round fenders and only a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox picked by primers    so hot we would race through the rows to reach the twentyfive gallon jugs of water placed throughout the field to encourage    and    in attempt to satisfy our insatiable thirsts from drinking air    which poured through our pores without breaking through to our need    for more water    in the sun sun we imagined to disappear yet respected    for growing all things on earth when quenched with rains called forth by our song     and drumming leaves which weeks later    would be taken down and the strings pulled like string on top of a large dogfood bag and sheeted up into burlap sheets that bundled over a hundred pounds when we smashed down with our feet but gently smashing then thrown up high    to a catcher    on a big clapboard trailer pulled behind twoton trucks and taken to market in fuquayvarina and sold to philip morris    and winstonsalem    for around    a buck a pound leaves cured to a bright leaf a golden yellow with the strongest aroma of tobacco barn curing and hand grown quality before the encroachment of big business in the reagan era and the slow murder of method from a hundred years before when the loons cried out in laughter by the springs and the bass popped the surface on the pond early on next to the fields before that time when it was unfashionable to transplant each individual baby plant the infant tobacco we nurtured to transplant those seedlings to each hill in the field the space for that particular plant and we watched    as    they would grow before all of this new age new way i was a sharecropper in willow springs north carolina as were you    and we were proud to be tsa la gi wishing for winter    so we could make camp at qualla boundary    and oconaluftee would be free of tourists and filled with snow and those of us who held out forever and had no cibs would be home again with our people while the bia forgot to watch when we still remembered before even the europeans working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants of their slaves they brought from africa when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the middle east that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we prayed whenever we smoked and did not smoke for pleasure    and i    was content and free then they came and changed things and you left me for a fancy white girl and i waited on the land until you brought her back in that brand new white trans am purchased from our crop    you gave her and left her waiting in a motel the nearest one was forty miles away but    near enough    for you and    for her    and i knew    though i never spoke a word to you about it    i knew and i kept it to myself    to this day    and time    and i never let on until i left    on our anniversary i drove the pickup down the dirt path    by the empty fields and rented a shack for eighty dollars the one with cardboard windows and a gillespie house floor design with torn and faded floral paper on walls and linoleum so thin over rotted board that the floor gave if you weighed over a hundred pounds    i did not and with no running water of any kind    or bathroom the one at hilltop    where i could see out across all the fields and hunt for meat when i wanted and find peace i heard you remarried and went into automated farming and kept up with america i watched all of you    from the hill and i waited for the lavender blooms to return    and when it was spring even the blooms    had turned white i rolled up my bedroll    remembering before when the fields were like waves on a green ocean and turned away    away from the change and corruption    of big business on small farms of traditional agricultural people    and sharecroppers away    so that i could always    hold this concise image of before    that    time    and it floods    my memory

 1  people who have no children can be hard attain a mail of ice and insolence need not pause in the fire and in no sense hesitate in the hurricane to guard and when wide world is bitten and bewarred they perish purely waving their spirits hence without a trace of grace or of offense to laugh or fail diffident wonderstarred while through a throttling dark we others hear the little lifting helplessness the queer whimperwhine whose unridiculous lost softness softly makes a trap for us and makes a curse and makes a sugar of the malocclusions the inconditions of love  2  what shall i give my children who are poor who are adjudged the leastwise of the land who are my sweetest lepers who demand no velvet and no velvety velour but who have begged me for a brisk contour crying that they are quasi contraband because unfinished graven by a hand less than angelic admirable or sure my hand is stuffed with mode design device but i lack access to my proper stone and plenitude of plan shall not suffice nor grief nor love shall be enough alone to ratify my little halves who bear across an autumn freezing everywhere  3  and shall i prime my children pray to pray mites come invade most frugal vestibules spectered with crusts of penitents’ renewals and all hysterics arrogant for a day instruct yourselves here is no devil to pay children confine your lights in jellied rules resemble graves be metaphysical mules learn lord will not distort nor leave the fray behind the scurryings of your neat motif i shall wait if you wish revise the psalm if that should frighten you sew up belief if that should tear turn singularly calm at forehead and at fingers rather wise holding the bandage ready for your eyes

 the dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows pasted with colored squares past the man who leans into the phone booth’s red pagoda past crates of doves and roosters veiled  until dawn fireworks complicate the streets with sulphur as people exchange gold and silver foil money to appease ghosts who linger needy even in death i am  almost invisible hands could pass through me effortlessly this is how it is to be so alien that my name falls from me grows untranslatable as the shop signs  the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle in the stairwell the corridor where the doors are blue months ajar hands gesture in the smoke the partial moon  of a face for hours the soft numeric click of mahjongg tiles drifts down the hallway where languid mai trails her musk of sex and narcotics  there is no grief in this only the old year consuming itself the door knob blazing in my hand beneath the lightbulb’s electric jewel between voices and fireworks  wind works bricks to dusthush hush no language i want to learn i can touch the sill worn by hands i’ll never know in this room with its low table  where i brew chrysanthemum tea the sign for jade palace sheds green corollas on the floor it’s dangerous to stand here in the chastening glow darkening  my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest of my life widening away from me waiting for the man i married to pass beneath the sign of the building to climb  the five flights and say his chinese name for me he’ll rise up out of the puzzling streets where men pass bottles of rice liquor where the new year is liquor the black bottle  the whole district is waiting for like some benevolent arrestthe moment when men and women turn to each other and dissolve each bad bet every sly mischance  the dalliance of hands they turn in lamplight the way i turn now wai min is in the doorway he brings fish he brings lotus root he brings me ghost money

 i remember when i wrote the circus i was living in paris or rather we were living in paris janice frank was alive the whitney museum was still on 8th street or was it still something else fernand léger lived in our building well it wasn’t really our building it was the building we lived in next to a grand guignol troupe who made a lot of noise so that one day i yelled through a hole in the wall of our apartment i don’t know why there was a hole there shut up and the voice came back to me saying something i don’t know what once i saw léger walk out of the building i think stanley kunitz came to dinner i wrote the circus in two tries the first getting most of the first stanza that fall i also wrote an opera libretto called louisa or matilda jeanclaude came to dinner he said about “cocktail sauce” it should be good on something but not on these oysters by that time i think i had already written the circus when i came back having been annoyed to have to go i forget what i went there about you were back in the apartment what a dump actually we liked it i think with your hair and your writing and the pans moving strummingly about the kitchen and i wrote the circus it was a summer night no it was an autumn one summer when i remember it but actually no autumn that black dusk toward the post office and i wrote many other poems then but the circus was the best maybe not by far the best geography was also wonderful and the airplane betty poems inspired by you but the circus was the best  sometimes i feel i actually am the person who did this who wrote that including that poem the circus but sometimes on the other hand i don’t there are so many factors engaging our attention at every moment the happiness of others the health of those we know and our own and the millions upon millions of people we don’t know and their wellbeing to think about so it seems strange i found time to write the circus and even spent two evenings on it and that i have also the time to remember that i did it and remember you and me then and write this poem about it at the beginning of the circus the circus girls are rushing through the night in the circus wagons and tulips and other flowers will be picked a long time from now this poem wants to get off on its own someplace like a painting not held to a depiction of composing the circus  noel lee was in paris then but usually out of it in germany or denmark giving a concert as part of an endless activity which was either his career or his happiness or a combination of both or neither i remember his dark eyes looking he was nervous with me perhaps because of our days at harvard  it is understandable enough to be nervous with anybody  how softly and easily one feels when alone love of one’s friends when one is commanding the time and space syndrome if that’s the right word which i doubt but together how come one is so nervous one is not always but what was i then and what am i now attempting to create if create is the right word out of this combination of experience and aloneness and who are you telling me it is or is not a poem not you go back with me though to those nights i was writing the circus do you like that poem have you read it it is in my book thank you which grove just reprinted i wonder how long i am going to live and what the rest will be like i mean the rest of my life  john cage said to me the other night how old are you and i told him fortysix since then i’ve become fortyseven he said oh that’s a great age i remember john cage once told me he didn’t charge much for his mushroom identification course at the new school because he didn’t want to make a profit from nature  he was ahead of his time i was behind my time we were both in time brilliant go to the head of the class and “time is a river” it doesn’t seem like a river to me it seems like an unformed plan days go by and still nothing is decided about what to do until you know it never will be and then you say “time” but you really don’t care much about it any more time means something when you have the major part of yours ahead of you as i did in aixenprovence that was three years before i wrote the circus that year i wrote bricks and the great atlantic rainway i felt time surround me like a blanket endless and soft i could go to sleep endlessly and wake up and still be in it but i treasured secretly the part of me that was individually changing like noel lee i was interested in my career and still am but now it is like a town i don’t want to leave not a tower i am climbing opposed by ferocious enemies  i never mentioned my friends in my poems at the time i wrote the circus although they meant almost more than anything to me of this now for some time i’ve felt an attenuation so i’m mentioning them maybe this will bring them back to me not them perhaps but what i felt about them john ashbery jane freilicher larry rivers frank o’hara their names alone bring tears to my eyes as seeing polly did last night it is beautiful at any time but the paradox is leaving it in order to feel it when you’ve come back the sun has declined and the people are merrier or else they’ve gone home altogether and you are left alone well you put up with that your sureness is like the sun while you have it but when you don’t its lack’s a black and icy night i came home and wrote the circus that night janice i didn’t come and speak to you and put my arm around you and ask you if you’d like to take a walk or go to the cirque medrano though that’s what i wrote poems about and am writing about that now and now i’m alone  and this is not as good a poem as the circus and i wonder if any good will come of either of them all the same

 he gossips like my grandmother this man with my face and i could stand amused all afternoon in the hon kee grocery amid hanging meats he chops roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders her entire skin burnt crisp flesh i know to be sweet her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file each pierced by black hooks through breast bill and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass i step to the counter recite and he without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue scribbles my order on a greasy receipt and chops it up quick  such a sorrowful chinese face nomad gobi northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw he could be my brother but finer and except for his left forearm which is engorged sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a twopound tool hes delicate narrow waisted his frame so slight a lover some rough other might break it down its smooth oily length in his lighthanded calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness he is a southerner from a riverprovince suited for scholarship his face poised above an open book he’d mumble his favorite passages he could be my grandfather come to america to get a western education in 1917 but too homesick to study he sits in the park all day reading poems and writing letters to his mother  he lops the head off chops the neck of the duck into six slits the body open groin to breast and drains the scalding juices then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver old blade that has worn into the surface of the round footthick chopblock a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel  the head flung from the body opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes and i see foetalcrouched inside the skull the homunculus gray brain grainy to eat did this animal after all at the moment its neck broke image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death is this how i too recoil from my day see how this shape hordes itself see how little it is see its grease on the blade is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed when names are called when crimes are tallied this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open is this how i presided over my century is this how i regarded the murders this is also how i prayed was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed this too was how i slept clutching my wife was it me in the other i loved when i loved another the butcher sees me eye this delicacy with a finger he picks it out of the skullcradle and offers it to me i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down i eat my man  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of upanddown inandout a lump of muscle chugchugging blood into the ear a lover’s heartshaped tongue flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time an engine crossing recrossing salt water hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor these are the faces i love the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways at various times thirteen gathered around the redwood happy talkative voracious at day’s end eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands  brothers and sisters by blood and design who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes we constitute a manymembered body of love in a world of shapes of my desires each one here is a shape of one of my desires and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts the face the body that jut jaw to gnash tendon that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites those long eyes closing on the seen those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang these teeth to bite my monosyllables these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul puffed or sunken according to the life dark or light according to the birth straight or humped whole manqué quasi each pleases verging on utter grotesquery all are beautiful by variety the soul too is a debasement of a text but thus it acquires salience although a human salience but inimitable and hence memorable god is the text the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic  a bright moment i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty downcurved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to including me the eater whole unto itself complete without me yet its shape complements the shape of my mind i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me and i feel urged to utterance urged to read the body of the world urged to say it in human terms my reading a kind of eating my eating a kind of reading my saying a diminishment my noise a loveinanswer what is it in me would devour the world to utter it what is it in me will not let the world be would eat not just this fish but the one who killed it the butcher who cleaned it i would eat the way he squats the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish clubs it takes it to the sink guts it drops it on the weighing pan i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water that liquid violence between the man’s hands i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse i would eat it all to utter it the deaths at the sinks those bodies prepared for eating i would eat and the standing deaths at the counters in the aisles the walking deaths in the streets the deathfarfromhome the death inastrangeland these chinatown deaths these american deaths i would devour this race to sing it this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world

 it is half past ten in stonington the trees droop apprehensive of the heat and the sky has turned that pale suspicious colour that means that it cannot support more light here on the terrace i and a companion each pretends to read the papers say that it is 90 in new york today  across the street work is going forward on the abominable house that once i fancied half might be mine and which was in fact the home of the anonymous couple i used to hear at night arguing in their unhappy bedroom now they are throwing out another wing and the site of overlooked love is changed beyond recognition  what will the day what will the summer bring psychic storms or calm productive doldrums our neighbours are no saner than ourselves perhaps it is time to give the stones a ring or to complain of the view from the gallery tower falling like a shadow across the calm veranda rich with malice and the threat of accidental meeting  this is not a house but a collection the largest in private hands of sacred objects a spiritual boutique where anyone even the wrecker who had come to spoil may find himself spending more than he expected on something he cannot quite identify here the little horrors become the household gods  for the work of love requires a rule of thumb not no laws in particular but its own whose pseudonym at least here and now is pleasure the morning wasted in work and misquotation a light but leisurely lunch then reading walking or just watching the sun all afternoon till hungry we draw to evening and ombre  who are we to thank for all of this the greatest favours are conferred in absence sometimes as a syllable gives comfort dependent on the time and place and person when pleasure and reality occur is there room for extra contemplation or the lyrical promenade it is enough  to know and this is surely recognition that the world is spherical and perfect now i wish to introduce the copper beech we saw on our walk english and native here as i am whose shade is not the green of contemplation but the imagination’s rich metallic colour wherein under libido we live

 i can see her in the kitchen cooking up for the hundredth time a little something from her limited midwestern repertoire cigarette going in the ashtray the red wine pulsing in its glass a warning light meaning everything was simmering just below the steel lid of her smile as she boiled the beef into submission chopped her way through the vegetable kingdom with the brokenhandled knife i use tonight feeling her anger rising from the dark chambers of the head of cabbage i slice through missing her wanting to chew things over with my mother again

 muses that sing loves sensual empery and lovers kindling your enraged fires at cupids bonfires burning in the eye blown with the empty breath of vain desires you that prefer the painted cabinet before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye that all your joys in dying figures set and stain the living substance of your glory abjure those joys abhor their memory and let my love the honourd subject be of love and honours complete history your eyes were never yet let in to see the majesty and riches of the mind but dwell in darkness for your god is blind

 i grew up in a village built on coal and labor an outhouse on a dirt road by a water pump glared at the whitewashed fences of uniformed yards that gaped like broken teeth in the mouths of miners  all summer we played cossacks and bandits shot our symbolic rifles and revolvers and when killed would crush a wild cherry in the breast pocket the spot where the heart stopped  who started it the red spreading over white satin never to be washed away completely “i killed you i killed you” i screamed as he fell down men found him three years later  in the abandoned mine after an explosion his clothes covered with coal dust and blood women howled like wolves “it’s nothing he’ll get up” i thought “it’s just that stupid wild cherry on his shirt”

 for james welch the first harvest of wheat in flatlands along the milk startled me into thoughts of you and this place we both remember and also forget as home maybe it was the familiarity or maybe it was my own need to ask if you have ever regretted leaving what bends what gives and have you ever missed this windit has now grown warm with late summer but soon it will be as dangerous as the bobcat stalking calves and pets just south of the river men take out their dogs a case of beer and wait in their pickups for dawn for a chance with their rifles they don’t understand that she isn’t going to make any mistakes with winter my need for an answer grows more desperate and there are only four roads out one is the same cat hunters drive with mannish glory and return along gun still oilshined and unshot another goes deeper into assiniboine territory this is the one i should talk myself into taking next i haven’t much traveled the third except to visit a hospital where after the first time my mother had refused chemotherapy and the last road you know as well as i do past the coralpainted catholic church its doors long ago sealed shut to the mouth of mission canyon then south just a ways to where the rockies cut open and forgive there you and i are on the ascent after that the arrival is what matters most

 after kees travels in north america 1santa fe  the walls are old he says i turn in the plaza and nod to weldon kees his face as dark as the cool shadows that surround us walls keeping him safe honoring his silence though he comes to me to be led away  the mountains out there are not old he claims and slips his hands into his coat we cross the street each indian blanket on the ground holding jewelry i would love to touch but kees and the navajo man selling his crafts are whispering to the ground  kees surprises me by entering the museum of arts i follow him the stone floor ringing with our footsteps empty arches blending above kees stops and turns to me one can see only so much he says  he leads me to the twisted dwarf the tangles form of faith and death arrows bristling from its muscled body a sacrifice of the ugly encased in glass kees staring at the sculpture as if he knows why we really cant see it he points to the deepest arrow and places a hand on my shoulder when you believe this you are home he tells me and walks out  2albuquerque  the sangre de cristo mountains are old and he is driving my car to the highest ridge the valley below avoiding the bright moon the same white light in the bay kees wanted to touch before he left  mist and clouds are a lie he claims look down there men are running away he drives slowly to the top and we get out the autumn sun burning terraces into scrub cedars and piñon pines he wrote about when he crossed here long ago standing on the edge of the cliff as if this is the only way for him to go  look past what you want to see he sighs as the wind takes his slick hair and makes him into someone i have seen before the streets of albuquerque down there as dusty as his closed eyes  we stand on the edge and i wait at this elevation with kees who wrote that the towns we will not visit are places where home truly lies i must go he decides where to i ask anyplace you havent seen he says and walks down the mountain  3tyuonyi  kees and i are happy when the sun splits the tree for a moment because yesterday controlled this mountain dawn burning mud deeper into the adobe cottonwoods catch fire here give the people time to hide inside turtle shells though they come out to watch us  i stop as the drawings come to life under the arches symbols familiar to those who sleep by crossing the street each night as i stare i realize a man who diappears wants to understand and not hide yet the designs tempt me to walk in the wrong direction and leave him behind to go farther up would mean a canyon where i have been  a dirt street inside another path tiny houses falling back letting me pass beyond their locked doors as if the smoking windows know where i must go when i enter the placita the old woman is not there because this is about bringing kees back the dirt street opens to the last scorched tree breaking out of walls to shade what cant be blessed its branches confusing until their cracks enter the ground in search of peace  4santa maria  water disappears to settle as clear glass that contains memories of thirst  the ancient hole found in the ruins kees hand keeping the others from skimming  the surface of the still water reaching to be alone under the mountain wall  though eyes that watch have seen this before men entering and never coming out  one hand keeps the other from touching the surface pulling back allows the echo of falling rocks  the deep swimmer breaking through walls to emerge on the other side of the well  where the first figures to emerge in centuries are sitting and rubbing sand over their wet shivering bodies  5fort selden  kees is getting tired in the desert heat and sits on a historic slab of western settlement  this old fort a museum where thirsty men come to drink from the bitter well  kees smokes too many cigarettes and shakes his head at me  look at the moth and the deep iris in your garden because the equation i found in san francisco  is an eclipse drawn on paper by my trembling hands  he pauses and takes a drag my head bathed in sweat and confusion as he coughs this  it is too late because jazz has gone away i placed a stone deity of a bird next to an eggplant  on my desk its smooth purple skin as significant as the gathering of birds in your head  their chirping coming from sorrow even from the bay where i never told a lie  though the grand steps lead to the burned church where the musicians used to trace my forehead  i stare at him and he tosses smoke on the ground because we are close to home  6el paso  kees waits at the bus station in my hometown we cannot go farther because the border here is out there and as violent as the reasons he disappeared in san francisco a long time ago i want to tell him who i think he is but i grew up here and must hide how things have really been drawing the light off the mountains as if the doubters of history are simply starving boys offering to shine kees shoes on the corner of paisano street  my hometown has a bridge but kees wont go near it because he says to cross it would be to admit there is something wrong on the other side of my familys house he can never cross because we have found our way here el paso dreaming its population of mute men must keep growing because the border keeps taking too many of them away  kees looks at the bus schedule runs out of cigarettes and everything is closed he nods at nothing and waits on the bench with someone he swears looks like me

 just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing we can hear it always earthquake starvation the everrenewing sump of corpseflesh but in this valley the snow falls silently all day and out our window we see the curtain of it shifting and folding hiding us away in our little house we see earth smoothened and beautified made like a fantasy the snowclad trees so graceful in our new bed which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost with our two cats cooker and smudgins lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners we lie loving and warm looking out from time to time “snowbound” we say we speak of the poet who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province the kingdom of cruelty where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months across the pass and drifted deep in the vale in our kitchen the maplefire murmurs in our stove we eat cheese and newmade bread and jumbo spanish olives which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeños and garlic and dill and thyme we have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh for a while we close the immense index of images that is our livesfor instance the child on the mescalero reservation in new mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family’s hut covered with sores unable to speak but of course we see the child every day we hold out our hands we touch him shyly we make offerings to his implacability no the index cannot close and how shall we survive we don’t and cannot and will never know beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable the machine like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house as big as the whole town may break through and lurch into our valley at any moment at any moment cheers baby here’s to us see how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back

 still half drunk after a night at cards with the grey dawn taking us unaware among our guilty kings and queens we drove far north in the morning winners losers to a stream in the high hills to climb up to a place one of us knew with some vague view of cutting losses or consolidating gains by the old standard appeal to the wilderness the desert the empty places of our exile bringing only the biblical bread and cheese and cigarettes got from a grocer’s on the way expecting to drink only the clear cold water among the stones and remember or forget though no one said anything about atonement there was still some purgatorial idea in all those aching heads and ageing hearts as we climbed the giant stair of the stream reaching the place around noon  it was as promised a wonder with granite walls enclosing ledges long and flat of limestone or rolling of lava within the ledges the water fast and still pouring its yellow light and green over the tilted slabs of the floor blackened at shady corners falling in a foam of crystal to a calm where the waterlight dappled the ledges as they leaned against the sun big blue dragonflies hovered and darted and dipped a wing hovered again against the low wind moving over the stream and shook the flakes of light from their clear wings this surely was it was what we had come for was nature though it looked like art with its grey fortress walls and laminated benches as in the waiting room of some petrified station but we believed and what it was we believed made of the place a paradise for ruined poker players win or lose who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks like gasping trout the water they drank making them drunk again lit cigarettes and lay back waiting for nature to say the last word as though the stones were memnon stones which caught in a certain light would sing  the silence and even the noise of the waters was silence grew pregnant that is the phrase grew pregnant but nothing else did the mountains brought forth not a mouse and the rocks unlike the ones you would expect to find on the slopes of purgatory or near helicon mollified by muses and with a little give to ’em were modern american rocks and hard as rocks our easy bones groaned our flesh baked on one side and shuddered on the other and each man thought bitterly about primitive simplicity and decadence and how he had been ruined by civilization and forced by circumstances to drink and smoke and sit up all night inspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards until he was brokenwinded as a trout on a rock and had no use for the doctrines of jean jacques rousseau and could no longer afford a savagery whether noble or not some would never batter that battered copy of walden again  but all the same the water the sunlight and the wind did something even the dragonflies did something to the minds full of telephone numbers and flushes to the flesh sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other and the rocks the old and tumbling boulders which formed the giant stair of the stream induced again some purgatorial ideas concerning humility concerning patience and enduring what had to be endured winning and losing and breaking even ideas of weathering in whatever weather being eroded or broken or ground down into pebbles by the stream’s necessitous and grave currents but to these ideas did any purgatory respond only this one that in a world where even the memnon stones were carved in soap one might at any rate wash with the soap  after a time we talked about the war about what we had done in the war and how near some of us had been to being drowned and burned and shot and how many people we knew who had been drowned or burned or shot and would it have been better to have died in the war the peaceful old war where we were young but the mineral peace or paralysis of those great stones the moving stillness of the waters entered our speech the ribs and blood of the earth from which all fables grow established poetry and truth in us so that at last one said “i shall play cards until the day i die” and another said “in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins and minerals needed to sustain man’s life” and still another “i shall live on smoke until my spirit has been cured of flesh”  climbing downstream again on the way home to the lives we had left empty for a day we noticed as not before how of three bridges not one had held the stream which in its floods had twisted the girders splintered the boards hurled boulder on boulder and had broken into rubble smashed practically back to nature the massive masonry of span after span with its indifferent rage this was a sight that sobered us considerably and kept us quiet both during the long drive home and after till it was time to deal the cards

 what was the future then but affirmation the first yes between us followed by the first lingering dawn waking below a window shaded by redwoods waking we hadn’t slept we found time saved like sunlight in a tree  still the house was cold and there were shadows the couple in the next room rapped the wall to quiet us like them condescending from a bitter knowledge that young as we all were love didn’t last but receded into silence  wedging our pillows back of the headboard that clapped in time with us we let them think we agreed then holding on we closed each other’s mouths and felt that slowness that the best days begin with turn into the speed with which they fly  flight was that year’s theme all around us flight of hunter and hunted the president turning inward on one wing and on the patio the emigration of termites a glittering fleet leaving that shadowed house a little lighter  within it all above it or beyond we thought we were the fixed point and held still as the quail lit down beside us and waited for her plump mate to appear his crest a quivering hook the valley’s reach of sunshine reeled them in  there was wilderness around us don’t forget behind the nets of fragrance thrown across our path by the acacia lurked the green man or the kidnapper and there was the pacific with its own passions taking place as rain  the sorrow of the couple in the next room was a deep muteness nightly that loneliness could come of loving was like news of time cored out of the redwood the house that we made shake or thought we did was taking wing already  after we left still it took us years before we stopped comparing every morning together to that first one and every place we lived to that first place and everything we said to that first word repeated all night long

‘silas is back’ she pushed him outward with her through the door and shut it after her ‘be kind’ she said she took the market things from warren’s arms and set them on the porch then drew him down to sit beside her on the wooden steps  ‘when was i ever anything but kind to him but i’ll not have the fellow back’ he said ‘i told him so last haying didn’t i if he left then i said that ended it what good is he who else will harbor him at his age for the little he can do what help he is there’s no depending on off he goes always when i need him most he thinks he ought to earn a little pay enough at least to buy tobacco with so he won’t have to beg and be beholden “all right” i say “i can’t afford to pay any fixed wages though i wish i could” “someone else can” “then someone else will have to” i shouldn’t mind his bettering himself if that was what it was you can be certain when he begins like that there’s someone at him trying to coax him off with pocketmoney in haying time when any help is scarce in winter he comes back to us i’m done’  ‘sh not so loud he’ll hear you’ mary said  ‘i want him to he’ll have to soon or late’  ‘he’s worn out he’s asleep beside the stove when i came up from rowe’s i found him here huddled against the barndoor fast asleep a miserable sight and frightening too you needn’t smilei didn’t recognize him i wasn’t looking for himand he’s changed wait till you see’  ‘where did you say he’d been’  ‘he didn’t say i dragged him to the house and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke i tried to make him talk about his travels nothing would do he just kept nodding off’  ‘what did he say did he say anything’  ‘but little’  ‘anything mary confess he said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me’  ‘warren’  ‘but did he i just want to know’  ‘of course he did what would you have him say surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man some humble way to save his selfrespect he added if you really care to know he meant to clear the upper pasture too that sounds like something you have heard before warren i wish you could have heard the way he jumbled everything i stopped to look two or three timeshe made me feel so queer to see if he was talking in his sleep he ran on harold wilsonyou remember the boy you had in haying four years since he’s finished school and teaching in his college silas declares you’ll have to get him back he says they two will make a team for work between them they will lay this farm as smooth the way he mixed that in with other things he thinks young wilson a likely lad though daft on educationyou know how they fought all through july under the blazing sun silas up on the cart to build the load harold along beside to pitch it on’  ‘yes i took care to keep well out of earshot’  ‘well those days trouble silas like a dream you wouldn’t think they would how some things linger harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him after so many years he still keeps finding good arguments he sees he might have used i sympathize i know just how it feels to think of the right thing to say too late harold’s associated in his mind with latin he asked me what i thought of harold’s saying he studied latin like the violin because he liked itthat an argument he said he couldn’t make the boy believe he could find water with a hazel prong which showed how much good school had ever done him he wanted to go over that but most of all he thinks if he could have another chance to teach him how to build a load of hay’  ‘i know that’s silas’ one accomplishment he bundles every forkful in its place and tags and numbers it for future reference so he can find and easily dislodge it in the unloading silas does that well he takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests you never see him standing on the hay he’s trying to lift straining to lift himself’  ‘he thinks if he could teach him that he’d be some good perhaps to someone in the world he hates to see a boy the fool of books poor silas so concerned for other folk and nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope so now and never any different’  part of a moon was falling down the west dragging the whole sky with it to the hills its light poured softly in her lap she saw it and spread her apron to it she put out her hand among the harplike morningglory strings taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves as if she played unheard some tenderness that wrought on him beside her in the night ‘warren’ she said ‘he has come home to die you needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time’  ‘home’ he mocked gently  ‘yes what else but home it all depends on what you mean by home of course he’s nothing to us any more than was the hound that came a stranger to us out of the woods worn out upon the trail’  ‘home is the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in’  ‘i should have called it something you somehow haven’t to deserve’  warren leaned out and took a step or two picked up a little stick and brought it back and broke it in his hand and tossed it by ‘silas has better claim on us you think than on his brother thirteen little miles as the road winds would bring him to his door silas has walked that far no doubt today why didn’t he go there his brother’s rich a somebodydirector in the bank’  ‘he never told us that’  ‘we know it though’  ‘i think his brother ought to help of course i’ll see to that if there is need he ought of right to take him in and might be willing to he may be better than appearances but have some pity on silas do you think if he’d had any pride in claiming kin or anything he looked for from his brother he’d keep so still about him all this time’  ‘i wonder what’s between them’  ‘i can tell you silas is what he iswe wouldn’t mind him but just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide he never did a thing so very bad he don’t know why he isn’t quite as good as anyone worthless though he is he won’t be made ashamed to please his brother’  ‘i can’t think si ever hurt anyone’  ‘no but he hurt my heart the way he lay and rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback he wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge you must go in and see what you can do i made the bed up for him there tonight you’ll be surprised at himhow much he’s broken his working days are done im sure of it’  ‘i’d not be in a hurry to say that’  ‘i haven’t been go look see for yourself but warren please remember how it is he’s come to help you ditch the meadow he has a plan you mustn’t laugh at him he may not speak of it and then he may i’ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud will hit or miss the moon’  it hit the moon then there were three there making a dim row the moon the little silver cloud and she  warren returnedtoo soon it seemed to her slipped to her side caught up her hand and waited  ‘warren’ she questioned  ‘dead’ was all he answered

 amongst dogs are listeners and singers my big dog sang with me so purely puckering her ruffled lips into an o beginning with small swallowing sounds like coltrane musing then rising to power and resonance gulping air to continue her passion and sense of flawless form singing not with me but for the art of dogs we joined in many fine songsstardust naima the trout my rosary perdido she was a great master and died young leaving me with unrelieved grief her talents known to only a few  now i have a small dog who does not sing but listens with discernment requiring skill and spirit in my falsetto voice i sing her name and words of love andante con brio vivace adagio  sometimes she is so moved she turns to place a paw across her snout closes her eyes sighing like a girl i held and danced with years ago  but i am a pretender to dog music the true strains rise only from the rich red chambers of a canine heart these melodies best when the moon is up listeners and singers together or apart beyond friendship and anger far from any human imposter ballads of long nights lifting to starlight songs of bones turds conquests hunts smells rankings things settled long before our birth

or seen timbuctoo or hath taken tea in smalleyd chinas crockeryware metropolis or sat amidst the bricks of nineveh may not think much of londons first appearance but ask him what he thinks of it a year hence  viii  don juan had got out on shooters hill sunset the time the place the same declivity which looks along that vale of good and ill where london streets ferment in full activity while everything around was calm and still except the creak of wheels which on their pivot he heard and that beelike bubbling busy hum of cities that boil over with their scum  ix  i say don juan wrappd in contemplation walkd on behind his carriage oer the summit and lost in wonder of so great a nation gave way tot since he could not overcome it and here he cried is freedoms chosen station here peals the peoples voice nor can entomb it racks prisons inquisitions resurrection awaits it each new meeting or election  x  here are chaste wives pure lives her people pay but what they please and if that things be dear tis only that they love to throw away their cash to show how much they have ayear here laws are all inviolate none lay traps for the traveller every highways clear herehe was interrupted by a knife withdamn your eyes your money or your life  xi  these freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads in ambush laid who had perceivd him loiter behind his carriage and like handy lads had seizd the lucky hour to reconnoitre in which the heedless gentleman who gads upon the road unless he prove a fighter may find himself within that isle of riches exposd to lose his life as well as breeches  xii  juan who did not understand a word of english save their shibboleth god damn and even that he had so rarely heard he sometimes thought twas only their salam or god be with youand tis not absurd to think so for half english as i am to my misfortune never can i say i heard them wish god with you save that way  xiii  juan yet quickly understood their gesture and being somewhat choleric and sudden drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture and fired it into one assailants pudding who fell as rolls an ox oer in his pasture and roard out as he writhd his native mud in unto his nearest follower or henchman oh jack im floord by that ere bloody frenchman  xiv  on which jack and his train set off at speed and juans suite late scatterd at a distance came up all marvelling at

less hasty with his flint  xv  perhapsthought heit is the countrys wont to welcome foreigners in this way now i recollect some innkeepers who dont differ except in robbing with a bow in lieu of a bare

man cried hold ive got my gruel oh for a glass of max weve missd our booty let me die where i am and as the fuel of life shrunk in his heart and thick and sooty the drops fell from his deathwound and he drew ill his breath he from his swelling throat untied a kerchief crying give sal thatand died  xvii  the cravat staind with bloody drops fell down before don juans feet he could not tell exactly why it was before him thrown nor what the meaning of the mans farewell poor tom was once a kiddy upon town a thorough varmint and a real swell full flash all fancy until fairly diddled his pockets

russ credential and was receivd with all the due grimace by those who govern in the mood potential who seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face thought what in state affairs is most essential that they as easily might do the youngster as hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster  xxxvi  they errd as aged men will do but by and by well talk of that and if we dont t will be because our notion is not high of politicians and their double front who live by lies yet dare not boldly lie now what i love in women is they wont or cant do otherwise than lie but do it so well the very truth seems falsehood to it  xxxvii  and after all what is a lie tis but the truth in masquerade and i defy historians heroes lawyers priests to put a fact without some leaven of a lie the very shadow of true truth would shut up annals revelations poesy and prophecyexcept it should be dated some years before the incidents related  xxxviii  praisd be all liars and all lies who now can tax my mild muse with

 1  i am thirty this november you are still small in your fourth year we stand watching the yellow leaves go queer flapping in the winter rain falling flat and washed and i remember mostly the three autumns you did not live here they said i’d never get you back again i tell you what you’ll never really know all the medical hypothesis that explained my brain will never be as true as these struck leaves letting go  i who chose two times to kill myself had said your nickname the mewling months when you first came until a fever rattled in your throat and i moved like a pantomime above your head ugly angels spoke to me the blame i heard them say was mine they tattled like green witches in my head letting doom leak like a broken faucet as if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet an old debt i must assume  death was simpler than i’d thought the day life made you well and whole i let the witches take away my guilty soul i pretended i was dead until the white men pumped the poison out putting me armless and washed through the rigamarole of talking boxes and the electric bed i laughed to see the private iron in that hotel today the yellow leaves go queer you ask me where they go i say today believed in itself or else it fell  today my small child joyce love your self’s self where it lives there is no special god to refer to or if there is why did i let you grow in another place you did not know my voice when i came back to call all the superlatives of tomorrow’s white tree and mistletoe will not help you know the holidays you had to miss the time i did not love myself i visited your shoveled walks you held my glove there was new snow after this   2  they sent me letters with news of you and i made moccasins that i would never use when i grew well enough to tolerate myself i lived with my mother too late too late to live with your mother the witches said but i didn’t leave i had my portrait done instead  part way back from bedlam i came to my mother’s house in gloucester massachusetts and this is how i came to catch at her and this is how i lost her i cannot forgive your suicide my mother said and she never could she had my portrait done instead  i lived like an angry guest like a partly mended thing an outgrown child i remember my mother did her best she took me to boston and had my hair restyled your smile is like your mother’s the artist said i didn’t seem to care i had my portrait done instead  there was a church where i grew up with its white cupboards where they locked us up row by row like puritans or shipmates singing together my father passed the plate too late to be forgiven now the witches said i wasn’t exactly forgiven they had my portrait done instead   3  all that summer sprinklers arched over the seaside grass we talked of drought while the saltparched field grew sweet again to help time pass i tried to mow the lawn and in the morning i had my portrait done holding my smile in place till it grew formal once i mailed you a picture of a rabbit and a postcard of motif number one as if it were normal to be a mother and be gone  they hung my portrait in the chill north light matching me to keep me well only my mother grew ill she turned from me as if death were catching as if death transferred as if my dying had eaten inside of her that august you were two but i timed my days with doubt on the first of september she looked at me and said i gave her cancer they carved her sweet hills out and still i couldn’t answer   4  that winter she came part way back from her sterile suite of doctors the seasick cruise of the xray the cells’ arithmetic gone wild surgery incomplete the fat arm the prognosis poor i heard them say  during the sea blizzards she had here own portrait painted a cave of mirror placed on the south wall matching smile matching contour and you resembled me unacquainted with my face you wore it but you were mine after all  i wintered in boston childless bride nothing sweet to spare with witches at my side i missed your babyhood tried a second suicide tried the sealed hotel a second year on april fool you fooled me we laughed and this was good   5  i checked out for the last time on the first of may graduate of the mental cases with my analyst’s okay my complete book of rhymes my typewriter and my suitcases  all that summer i learned life back into my own seven rooms visited the swan boats the market answered the phone served cocktails as a wife should made love among my petticoats  and august tan and you came each weekend but i lie you seldom came i just pretended you small piglet butterfly girl with jelly bean cheeks disobedient three my splendid  stranger and i had to learn why i would rather die than love how your innocence would hurt and how i gather guilt like a young intern his symptoms his certain evidence  that october day we went to gloucester the red hills reminded me of the dry red fur fox coat i played in as a child stockstill like a bear or a tent like a great cave laughing or a red fur fox  we drove past the hatchery the hut that sells bait past pigeon cove past the yacht club past squall’s hill to the house that waits still on the top of the sea and two portraits hung on the opposite walls   6  in north light my smile is held in place the shadow marks my bone what could i have been dreaming as i sat there all of me waiting in the eyes the zone of the smile the young face the foxes’ snare  in south light her smile is held in place her cheeks wilting like a dry orchid my mocking mirror my overthrown love my first image she eyes me from that face that stony head of death i had outgrown  the artist caught us at the turning we smiled in our canvas home before we chose our foreknown separate ways the dry red fur fox coat was made for burning i rot on the wall my own dorian gray  and this was the cave of the mirror that double woman who stares at herself as if she were petrified in time  two ladies sitting in umber chairs you kissed your grandmother and she cried   7  i could not get you back except for weekends you came each time clutching the picture of a rabbit that i had sent you for the last time i unpack your things we touch from habit the first visit you asked my name now you stay for good i will forget how we bumped away from each other like marionettes on strings it wasn’t the same as love letting weekends contain us you scrape your knee you learn my name wobbling up the sidewalk calling and crying you call me mother and i remember my mother again somewhere in greater boston dying  i remember we named you joyce so we could call you joy you came like an awkward guest that first time all wrapped and moist and strange at my heavy breast i needed you i didn’t want a boy only a girl a small milky mouse of a girl already loved already loud in the house of herself we named you joy i who was never quite sure about being a girl needed another life another image to remind me and this was my worst guilt you could not cure nor soothe it i made you to find me

 the sea is calm tonight the tide is full the moon lies fair upon the straits on the french coast the light gleams and is gone the cliffs of england stand glimmering and vast out in the tranquil bay come to the window sweet is the nightair only from the long line of spray where the sea meets the moonblanched land listen you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return up the high strand begin and cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of sadness in  sophocles long ago heard it on the ægean and it brought into his mind the turbid ebb and flow of human misery we find also in the sound a thought hearing it by this distant northern sea  the sea of faith was once too at the full and round earth’s shore lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled but now i only hear its melancholy long withdrawing roar retreating to the breath of the nightwind down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the world  ah love let us be true to one another for the world which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams so various so beautiful so new hath really neither joy nor love nor light nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain and we are here as on a darkling plain swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night

 1  look here marcus aurelius we’ve come to see your temple deluded the guards crawled through a hole in the fence why your descendent my guide and friend  has opted for secrecy i don’t know but i do know what to call the africans passportless yelloweyed who will ride the boat before me for naples they hope  here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winter storm like a cough or the seadog drops them at hannibal’s shores where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants  what dimension of time will they cross at the hours loop tight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists what siren song will the trucks shipping them back  to ouagadougou drone into their ears i look at them loitering waiting for the second act of their darkness to fall i look at the sky shake her dicey fists  one can be thankful i suppose for not being one of them and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneself to keep the cold wind at bay but what world is this  that makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s rope is about to snap while the sea and sky ache to become an openended road that’s what we’re all waiting for  a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit and let us in on its sweetness as we wait smoking or fondling provisions listening the engine’s invocational purr in an hour  that will dawn and dusk at once one that will stretch into days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat they will ride their tormented ship as the dog star  begins to float on the water so bright and still you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand   2  a pair of roman fists robbed of spear and shield the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcorn  that slipped from the buttery hands aluminum wrappers smudged with processed cheese  countless cigarette butts surround the fallen columns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam  pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…  the ruins are not ruined without all this garbage packed stratified how else to name our age   3  earlier i had walked the market of sabratha changed to its people but like my old city brought me back to me the petty merchants all selling the same goods shouted out jokes to each other a sudanese waiter carried a tray with a giant pot of green tea with mint among the older men  their heads capped with crimson shennas i kept seeking my father’s face an old lust wafted past me when the abayaclad women scented with knockoff chanel sashayed by the sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaves  with spoons of searing harissa my mouth watering to a childhood burn pyramids of local oranges late season pomegranates radish and turnip bulbs stacked like billiard balls and the half carcasses of lambs as if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks  the trays of hearts kidneys brains and testicles arrayed in slick arabesques the handwoven rugs where the extinct mouflon thrives mincers hairdryers and toasters their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves  it was as if my eyes were painting not seeing what i saw my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole what face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration i know what the eyes of the men my age said settled now in comfortable middle age about the life i left behind  true i did envy them the asceticism of their grace where a given horizon becomes a birthrightto drive or walk past the same hills all your life to eat from the same tree and drink from the well that gave you your name   4  though for centuries the locals broke the statues’ limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery enough remains to echo all that has disappeared  you and the woman leave the towpath and you brace her against the trunk of an oak it’s not the moonlight but refractions from suburban homes trapped under cloudcover that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees  first god made love the canopy like the inside of an emerald her lips a rush of cochineal then a route of evanescence brought her from carthage into these living arms here   5  “a nice time “ he tells us how he and four cousins crossed the desert heading home on top of threeyears’ worth of meager pay the tarp ballooning a giant dough roped to a truck  wearing the goggles of the welder hed hoped to become he looked at the sky and wondered “what those flying smoke on their tails thought of us”  later deported in a cargo plane he handed the tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports and they like “space aliens” in shabby uniforms sunglasses tribal veils poured into his face  as the propellers’ hammering calmed to a shuddering hum he saw the stars “hundreds of them like gnats” swarm mt akakous’ peak  “my next road is the water” he says serving us tonight and we promise if the coffee is good to put him on the next boat to the moon shining over syracuse   6  suddenly i find your descendant’s hands leafing through my chapters scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts  “how is it” he asks “that starlight announces the hour how can a song divide desire in two”  “my flame” i must have written or said “coated her body like silk one kiss spreading threads of lightening  into her pores until she became a sob barely lifted by the wind and i became mist the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn”   to that he responds “a platonic echo” and “what will come of such a plasticine love”  marcus aurelius your descendent knows i’ll leave as i arrive so empty he gets lost in me   7  two centuries ago one of my ancestors sat on one of the communal latrines in midmorning and listened to apuleius’s defense across from him on that marble hexagon sat two other men on normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest  the feast of venus coming soon but today they listen to the madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes cracking their own oneliners shaking their heads in delight away from the hot midday sun and the throngs  you could say they had the best seats in the house and so they lingered and heard as much as they could then went about their business so what if a man maries an older woman for her money what impoverished young roman in his right mind wouldn’t do that and sure too if some man  comes to take your inheritance even if he’s your best friend even if he takes good care of your mother you’d be a fool not to sue him to the council even if you’d have to accuse him falsely of black magic that’s the beauty of it or rather  whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty that things being already right can be more right which is what “beautiful” really means and what better way to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life   8  marcus aurelius the men at the shore follow your path into eternity though they already see their journey as a quarrel with circumstance their lives abscesses feeding  on the universe’s hide tumors in detention camps in basement kitchens their pockets filled with drachmas they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet leadheavy with shame  one of them is now driving a taxi in thessaloniki or perugia with enough of the language to understand direction he engages his late night passengers in the light of the dashboard  they’ll entrust him with their secrets with time he’ll become a light unto himself his car a winged chariot of human folly and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark  soil of philosophy it’s the gift of seasons that stray from the earth when soul reigns incidental to flesh forgiving to no end a light that has long surpassed itself   9  the birds that drew the line to the first distance remain nameless to me  creamy white breasts gold dust around their eyes blackbrown dark roast wings  the deserts they crossed the plains east or north of here fall like sand from my hands  um bsisi i want to call them citizens of a protracted destiny native and stranger prodigal and peasant  admit now they you’re none of these that you’re not any or even all of them combined   10  southwest of here is apuleius’s hometown his inescapable destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies “lacking the poverty of the rich” he’s splurged a monthlong trip to the olympic games and openhanded he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries  few return to madaura once gone and when heading back shamefaced like him they’d do as he did taking the longest route hoping the journey would never end here in sabratha the widow hooked him or he let her reel him and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began  i look out toward madaura my back to the theater and the latrines madaura birthplace of augustine site of his first schoolinglittle augustine holding a satchel of scrolls and a  loaf of bread for the teacher awakened by his mother  his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals his stomach warm with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make forced to slurp it sweetened with honey from the atlas a sprinkling of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm  if the world is that sweet and warm if it is that mothering why then this perpetual scene of separation this turning out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love  he lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own he refuses the warm

the color of semen i think then hands the pipe hose to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over  to the travelers in turn the air smells sweet around us the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine their communion done they embark except the one who stands the dead rooster in his hand as if wanting  to entrust it to us then digs a hurried hole to bury it in the boat barely visible leaves a leaden lacey ribbon aiming directly for the burnt orange sun as it reddens for a moment their standing silhouettes eclipse it  then the sea restores its dominion dark as the

 i  one reason to eat is to not speak said the man with a mouth full of food when she told me that my  silence was worse than her silence i agreed even though she was wrong it is shallow to fight  for things he said but sometimes it can be fun you look like a tunnel she said and kissed my lips what  i like least about words is their capacity to invoke more words she said as she trashed my  poem according to the new york times gay teenage boys want monogamy while  heterosexual boys prefer “friends with benefits” my psychiatrist told me it was  okay to lie about the important details of my life as a result i fell in love with  her i stopped seeing her as a patient but when we dated the spark was gone if as cioran writes  existing is plagiarism then what is death i was lost all night in the forest only to  discover these were streets i knew quite well in the oresteia apollo argues that the true  parent is “he who mounts” because the furies fail to ask what happens when the woman is on top  they lose the case in evaluations a student wrote “daniel would be a better teacher  if he wasn’t such an asshole” weren’t such an asshole i wanted to tell her though as her  comments were supposed to be anonymous i could not admit that i recognized her  handwriting on a first date i innocently went to the bathroom when the check arrived she thought  i was trying to stick her with the bill but when she realized i was unaware of dating  etiquette she was charmed  we had a nice kiss goodnight but afterwards i was so flustered i went to a bar by myself drank whiskey and smoked my first cigarette in years   ii  throughout my life i have always wanted to tell the truth even though i knew it was all a lie in the end all that matters is the truth content of a lie

twere a sin to rob them of their mite yet neer one sprig of laurel gracd these ribalds from slashing bentley down to pidling tibbalds each wight who reads not and but scans and spells each wordcatcher that lives on syllables evn such small critics some regard may claim preservd in miltons or in shakespeares name pretty in amber to observe the forms of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms the things we know are neither rich nor rare but wonder how the devil they got there  were others angry i excusd them too well might they rage i gave them but their due a mans true merit tis not hard to find but each mans secret standard in his mind that casting weight pride adds to emptiness this who can gratify for who can guess the bard whom pilferd pastorals renown who turns a persian tale for half a crown just writes to make his barrenness appear and strains from hardbound brains eight lines a year he who still wanting though he lives on theft steals much spends little yet has nothing left and he who now to sense now nonsense leaning means not but blunders round about a meaning and he whose fustians so sublimely bad it is not poetry but prose run mad all these my modest satire bade translate and ownd that nine such poets made a tate how did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe and swear not addison himself was safe  peace to all such but were there one whose fires true genius kindles and fair fame inspires blest with each talent and each art to please and born to write converse and live with ease should such a man too fond to rule alone bear like the turk no brother near the throne view him with scornful yet with jealous eyes and hate for arts that causd himself to rise damn with faint praise assent with civil leer and without sneering teach the rest to sneer willing to wound and yet afraid to strike just hint a fault and hesitate dislike alike reservd to blame or to commend a timrous foe and a suspicious friend dreading evn fools by flatterers besiegd and so obliging that he neer obligd like cato give his little senate laws and sit attentive to his own applause while wits and templars evry sentence raise and wonder with a foolish face of praise who but must laugh if such a man there be who would not weep if atticus were he  what though my name stood rubric on the walls or plaisterd posts with claps in capitals or smoking forth a hundred hawkers load on wings of winds came flying all abroad i sought no homage from the race that write i kept like asian monarchs from their sight poems i heeded now berhymd so long no more than thou great george a birthday song i neer with wits or witlings passd my days to spread about the itch of verse and praise nor like a puppy daggled through the town to fetch and carry singsong up and down nor at

 i asked my father “would you rather die of cancer or a heart attack would you rather be executed or put in jail for life which would you rather be a spy or a sentinel” and he tried to answer honestly combing his thinning hair with his fingers thinking of something else at last he fell silent i ran out to savor the dregs of dusk playing with my friends in the road that led to the highway the ball flew up toward day and landed in night we chanted every other minute a truck summoned by our warnings brushed past in a gust of light the driver’s curses muffled by distance the oncoming wheels were the point of the game like the scores in chalk or the blood from scuffed knees that we smeared across our faces so when my mother called her voice was quaint and stymied and i took all the time in the world trotting home past tarped barbecue pits past names of lovers filling with sap past tentative wind from sprinklers then i was stunned to see my golden window where all faces hanging plants dangling pots were framed by night and dwarfed by a ravenous inwardturning light

 he slaughtered a six of miller in thanks when his supposed schizophrenia turned out to be mere panic fewer than half the syllables and “easily managed with the new medications” chanted that mantra when his piano teacher’s voice droned on like an undertow beneath chopin hours after she herself had gone home to queens and when stop signs seemed to say slightly more than stop seemed in fact to convey highly specific messages to him and him alone suggesting he assume certain key responsibilities including twentyfourhour telephone contact with his finacée “to make sure nothing bad happens to her” and the immediate emergency closure of the holland tunnel…oh come on doc if this isn’t schizo what is and after all it took so long to nose the rental car’s savage servility through new jersey for thanksgiving at her mother’s that by the time he arrived he can’t possibly have been the same person he had been when he left brooklyn and is that not a kind of multiple person ality it took hours and then it was awkward which could describe so many things the gangly halfdismantled turkey splayed on its platter her stepfathers lecture on property taxes and tougher sentences the sevendollar jug of chablis which would come up later while he held back her hair every good boy deserves fudge and he tried to be one and earn huge loamy slabs of it he practiced his scales on the steering wheel as he breezed by stop sign after stop sign toward the tunnel stopped to search for the exact change then resumed rehearsal as she deeply soused snored wetly beside him smelling like something spilled on a rug he keyed each étude over and over as though there would not be many more chances or changes which i typed first by accident but had the chance to change for which i am thankful but what am i doing in here

 my dear it was a moment to clutch at for a moment so that you may believe in it and believing is the act of love i think even in the telling wherever it went  in the false new england forest where the misplanted norwegian trees refused to root their thick synthetic roots barging out of the dirt to work on the air we held hands and walked on our knees actually there was no one there  for forty years this experimental woodland grew shaft by shaft in perfect rows where its stub branches held and its spokes fell it was a place of parallel trees their lives filed out in exile where we walked too alien to know our sameness and how our sameness survives  outside of us the village cars followed the white line we had carefully walked two nights before toward our single beds we lay halfway up an ugly hill and if we fell it was here in the woods where the woods were caught in their dying and you held me well  and now i must dream the forest whole and your sweet hands not once as frozen as those stopped trees nor ruled nor pale nor leaving mine today in my house i see our house its pillars a dim basement of men holding up their foreign ground for you and me  my dear it was a time butchered from time that we must tell of quickly before we lose the sound of our own mouths calling mine mine mine

 to make a final conquest of all me love did compose so sweet an enemy in whom both beauties to my death agree joining themselves in fatal harmony that while she with her eyes my heart does bind she with her voice might captivate my mind  i could have fled from one but singly fair my disentangled soul itself might save breaking the curled trammels of her hair but how should i avoid to be her slave whose subtle art invisibly can wreath my fetters of the very air i breathe  it had been easy fighting in some plain where victory might hang in equal choice but all resistance against her is vain who has th’advantage both of eyes and voice and all my forces needs must be undone she having gained both the wind and sun

 dropouts  mace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake for brawn i don’t know why i call it courage  sure he stood up to greasers and didn’t visibly fret on the days when his report card made hard fact  of what was already apparent from his absences yet mace was gifted with an uninflected quickness a fine  intelligence of his own despair a knowledge as he gunned the engine of his once white ’58 chevy  with a fouronthefloor he’d installed himself to climb higher into the hills above the city  of where nowhere was… light shadow cutting brusquely across the canyons    like everyone else in our class mace was a year older than me he had stubble on his chin  i dragged a razor up and down my cheeks to inspire fast early growth  “don’t shave your jowls” friends warned knowing i overdid everything  “or you’ll grow hair there later” later was a word i disdained its insistence  on the future tense postponement life on the back burner    mace seemed incapable of worry his coolness and insouciance made girls stare  he was always brushing back the shock of raven black hair that fell over his right eyebrow  the same teacher who sent me lickety split to the principal’s office  would lean over mace’s desk and whisper warmly compassionately in his ear  they would nod together i could fill in every blank “what’s the matter richard”  “nothing” “if you’re having trouble” this is where the whispering grew most intense  “i want you to feel you can talk to me as a friend your work in class is so good you have so much ability richard…”  mace would never protest never defend himself indignation was a country where he’d never been  “you may hate me” i thought praying she would not double the insult of the absence of her concern  for me with a glance in my direction “but deep down mace and i are the same”    mace and i were running into the same problem at the same time mathematical  wizards that we were we couldn’t solve advanced algebraic equations in our head  we were vexed by an added integer we had gotten this far without lifting a pencil  history was being sold to us as a dead language of fixed events and we wouldn’t buy  what is a fact i wondered and i could see the same question wrinkling mace’s brow    mace’s problems weren’t academic his disgust thrummed like telephone wires in the wind even his saturnine  presence was deceptive like his beatup chevy with its secret store of power concealed under the hood  mace too began the year in the front row placed there on the strength of pure ability  he sank slowly buoyed as i was by the one assigned book we readgreat expectations  mace attended to his tasks in the classroom i dreamt of escape via the window’s easy access  there were unknown roads to be driven gulleys to be plumbed girls a world of lovely distractions    for all the years i lived in salt lake city i can’t remember seeing a single bird  i felt watched in salt lake city ever since that first day when the old geezer stepped  out of the shadows on a street vast and empty and without verticals to reprimand my double  mint gum wrapper for lighting in the gutter but only around the time of hitchcock’s the birds  did i start to withdraw from sight i was keen to see the birds the wednesday  afternoon it opened and i wanted the other“good”“mark r” the irreproachable blond mormon angel everyone loved to join us  our growling engine brought his mother to the porch the sun glared on her helmet of curlers  mark had “homework and chores” she said he “can’t come down” but he had already descended and stood framed in the doorway  i couldn’t get accustomed to the light in the trampled meadows around his house  the glow of dandelions thistles weeds mark’s red cheeks reeked of aspiration and i could read  his thoughtswhy couldn’t i wait until night why was i dragging myself down  why skip history and rifle assembly the movie would wait  but i would not i was keen and seeking a purging terror to cleanse  me of my dread i sat alone with mace in the vast empty theater alive to each  click and flicker in the projection room and the radiant impalpable dust  caught in the unstinting beam released from the limits of our world  until the screeching stopped and looked at askance by strangers  we stepped into an iron dark which held no trace of the light we’d left    i forked over whatever change i had to fuel each day’s freewheeling splendor  one morning knowing mace was down to smoking butts i brought a pack of my mother’s kents  as an offering mace scorned them he only smoked marlboros  yet later desperate and broke in the maze of roads through the hills overlooking the city  he broke off the filters and smoked in silence i was used to doing the talking  for the two of us but this was different he pulled up besides a long driveway  a vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs this was where he lived he’d be  “a sec”he had “some smokes” stashed in a drawer i followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees  toward an opulent utterly contemporary house fronted by oak door and gold bellknocker  angular white highceilinged skylit… our apartment could have fit into the living room…  now i understood mace lived in the clouds though i couldn’t see beyond the back yard  through the landscaping i knew what the view must be like that was the reason to live there  for the nights when the city innocent as it was still blazed through its grid of interlocking lights    on may day mace and i long ago tossed out of rotc for “insubordination”  but required to attend the final showofarms sat together in the bleachers  in splendid isolation and watched as the rulefollowersled  by the manystriped other mark r in their woolen khaki uniforms  shouldering their m 1 rifles dropped like flies in the insuperable heat

 the morning after my death we will sit in cafés but i will not be there i will not be      there was the great death of birds the moon was consumed with fire the stars were visible until noon   green was the forest drenched with shadows the roads were serpentine   a redwood tree stood alone with its lean and lit body unable to follow the cars that went by with frenzy a tree is always an immutable traveller   the moon darkened at dawn the mountain quivered with anticipation and the ocean was doubleshaded the blue of its surface with the blue of flowers mingled in horizontal water trails there was a breeze to witness the hour      the sun darkened at the fifth hour of the day the beach was covered with conversations pebbles started to pour into holes and waves came in like horses      the moon darkened on christmas eve angels ate lemons in illuminated churches there was a blue rug planted with stars above our heads lemonade and war news competed for our attention our breath was warmer than the hills      there was a great slaughter of rocks   of spring leaves of creeks the stars showed fully the last king of the mountain gave battle and got killed   we lay on the grass covered dried blood with our bodies green blades swayed between our teeth      we went out to sea a bank of whales was heading south a young man among us a hero tried to straddle one of the sea creatures his body emerged as a muddy pool as mud we waved goodbye to his remnants happy not to have to bury him in the early hours of the day   we got drunk in a barroom the small town of fairfax had just gone to bed cherry trees were bending under the weight of their flowers they were involved in a ceremonial dance to which no one had ever been invited      i know flowers to be funeral companions they make poisons and venoms and eat abandoned stone walls   i know flowers shine stronger than the sun their eclipse means the end of times   but i love flowers for their treachery their fragile bodies grace my imagination’s avenues   without their presence my mind would be an unmarked grave      we met a great storm at sea looked back at the rocking cliffs the sand was going under black birds were leaving the storm ate friends and foes alike water turned into salt for my wounds      flowers end in frozen patterns artificial gardens cover the floors we get up close to midnight search with powerful lights the tiniest shrubs on the meadows a stream desperately is running to the ocean

 i  i can hear little clicks inside my dream night drips its silver tap down the back at 4 am i wake thinking  of the man who left in september his name was law  my face in the bathroom mirror has white streaks down it i rinse the face and return to bed tomorrow i am going to visit my mother   she  she lives on a moor in the north she lives alone spring opens like a blade there i travel all day on trains and bring a lot of books  some for my mother some for me including the collected works of emily brontë this is my favourite author  also my main fear which i mean to confront whenever i visit my mother i feel i am turning into emily brontë  my lonely life around me like a moor my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation that dies when i come in the kitchen door what meat is it emily we need    three  three silent women at the kitchen table my mother’s kitchen is dark and small but out the window there is the moor paralyzed with ice it extends as far as the eye can see  over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky mother and i are chewing lettuce carefully the kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps  once a minute over the twelve i have emily p 216 propped open on the sugarbowl but am covertly watching my mother  a thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside my mother is studying her lettuce i turn to p 217  “in my flight through the kitchen i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chairback in the doorway   ”  it is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass now and then a remark trails through the glass taxes on the back lot not a good melon  too early for melons hairdresser in town found god closes shop every tuesday mice in the teatowel drawer again little pellets chew off  the corners of the napkins if they knew what paper napkins cost nowadays rain tonight  rain tomorrow that volcano in the philippines at it again what’s her name anderson died no not shirley  the opera singer negress cancer not eating your garnish you don’t like pimento  out the window i can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a depression the ice has begun to unclench black open water comes  curdling up like anger my mother speaks suddenly that psychotherapy’s not doing you much good is it you aren’t getting over him  my mother has a way of summing things up she never liked law much but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life  well he’s a taker and you’re a giver i hope it works out was all she said after she met him give and take were just words to me  at the time i had not been in love before it was like a wheel rolling downhill but early this morning while mother slept  and i was downstairs reading the part in wuthering heights where heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing come in come in to the ghost of his heart’s darling  i fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too she knows how to hang puppies that emily  it isn’t like taking an aspirin you know i answer feebly dr haw says grief is a long process she frowns what does it accomplish  all that raking up the past ohi spread my hands i prevail i look her in the eye she grins yes you do   whacher  whacher emily’s habitual spelling of this word has caused confusion for example  in the first line of the poem printed tell me whether is it winter in the shakespeare head edition but whacher is what she wrote  whacher is what she was she whached god and humans and moor wind and open night she whached eyes stars inside outside actual weather  she whached the bars of time which broke she whached the poor core of the world wide open  to be a whacher is not a choice there is nowhere to get away from it no ledge to climb up tolike a swimmer  who walks out of the water at sunset shaking the drops off it just flies open to be a whacher is not in itself sad or happy  although she uses these words in her verse as she uses the emotions of sexual union in her novel grazing with euphemism the work of whaching  but it has no name it is transparent sometimes she calls it thou  “emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet” records charlotte in 1828 unsociable even at home  and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out emily made her awkward way across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers  this sad stunted life says one uninteresting unremarkable wracked by disappointment and despair says another  she could have been a great navigator if she’d been male suggests a third meanwhile emily continued to brush into the carpet the question  why cast the world away for someone hooked up to thou the world may have seemed a kind of halffinished sentence  but in between the neighbour who recalls her coming in from a walk on the moors with her face “lit up by a divine light”  and the sister who tells us emily never made a friend in her life is a space where the little raw soul  slips through it goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel out of sight  the little raw soul was caught by no one she didn’t have friends children sex religion marriage success a salary or a fear of death she worked  in total six months of her life at a school in halifax and died on the sofa at home at 2 pm on a winter afternoon in her thirtyfirst year she spent  most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet walking the moor or whaching she says  it gave her peace “all tight and right in which condition it is to be hoped we shall all be this day 4 years” she wrote in her diary paper of 1837  yet her poetry from beginning to end is concerned with prisons vaults cages bars curbs bits bolts fetters locked windows narrow frames aching walls  “why all the fuss” asks one critic “she wanted liberty well didn’t she have it a reasonably satisfactory homelife  a most satisfactory dreamlifewhy all this beating of wings what was this cage invisible to us which she felt herself to be confined in”  well there are many ways of being held prisoner i am thinking as i stride over the moor as a rule after lunch mother has a nap  and i go out to walk the bare blue trees and bleached wooden sky of april carve into me with knives of light  something inside it reminds me of childhood it is the light of the stalled time after lunch when clocks tick  and hearts shut and fathers leave to go back to work and mothers stand at the kitchen sink pondering  something they never tell you remember too much my mother said to me recently  why hold onto all that and i said where can i put it down she shifted to a question about airports  crops of ice are changing to mud all around me as i push on across the moor warmed by drifts from the pale blue sun  on the edge of the moor our pines dip and coast in breezes from somewhere else  perhaps the hardest thing about losing a lover is to watch the year repeat its days it is as if i could dip my hand down  into time and scoop up blue and green lozenges of april heat a year ago in another country  i can feel that other day running underneath this one like an old videotapehere we go fast around the last corner up the hill to his house shadows  of limes and roses blowing in the car window and music spraying from the radio and him singing and touching my left hand to his lips  law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now still carries the sound of the telephone in that room  and traffic far off and doves under the window chuckling coolly and his voice saying you beauty i can feel that beauty’s  heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room no i say aloud i force my arms down through air which is suddenly cold and heavy as water  and the videotape jerks to a halt like a glass slide under a drop of blood i stop and turn and stand into the wind  which now plunges towards me over the moor when law left i felt so bad i thought i would die this is not uncommon  i took up the practice of meditation each morning i sat on the floor in front of my sofa and chanted bits of old latin prayers  de profundis clamavi ad te domine each morning a vision came to me gradually i understood that these were naked glimpses of my soul  i called them nudes nude 1 woman alone on a hill she stands into the wind  it is a hard wind slanting from the north long flaps and shreds of flesh rip off the woman’s body and lift and blow away on the wind leaving  an exposed column of nerve and blood and muscle calling mutely through lipless mouth it pains me to record this  i am not a melodramatic person but soul is “hewn in a wild workshop” as charlotte brontë says of wuthering heights  charlotte’s preface to wuthering heights is a publicist’s masterpiece like someone carefully not looking at a scorpion crouched on the arm of the sofa charlotte  talks firmly and calmly about the other furniture of emily’s workshopabout the inexorable spirit “stronger than a man simpler than a child”  the cruel illness “pain no words can render” the autonomous end “she sank rapidly she made haste to leave us” and about emily’s total subjection  to a creative project she could neither understand nor control and for which she deserves no more praise nor blame than if she had opened her mouth  “to breathe lightning” the scorpion is inching down the arm of the sofa while charlotte continues to speak helpfully about lightning  and other weather we may expect to experience when we enter emily’s electrical atmosphere it is “a horror of great darkness” that awaits us there  but emily is not responsible emily was in the grip “having formed these beings she did not know what she had done” says charlotte of heathcliff and earnshaw and catherine  well there are many ways of being held prisoner the scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee as charlotte concludes “on herself she had no pity”  pitiless too are the heights which emily called wuthering because of their “bracing ventilation” and “a north wind over the edge”  whaching a north wind grind the moor that surrounded her father’s house on every side formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit  taught emily all she knew about love and its necessities an angry education that shapes the way her characters use one another “my love for heathcliff” says catherine  “resembles the eternal rocks beneath a source of little visible delight but necessary” necessary i notice the sun has dimmed  and the afternoon air sharpening i turn and start to recross the moor towards home what are the imperatives  that hold people like catherine and heathcliff together and apart like pores blown into hot rock and then stranded out of reach  of one another when it hardens what kind of necessity is that the last time i saw law was a black night in september autumn had begun  my knees were cold inside my clothes a chill fragment of moon rose he stood in my living room and spoke  without looking at me not enough spin on it he said of our five years of love inside my chest i felt my heart snap into two pieces  which floated apart by now i was so cold it was like burning i put out my hand to touch his he moved back  i don’t want to be sexual with you he said everything gets crazy but now he was looking at me yes i said as i began to remove my clothes  everything gets crazy when nude i turned my back because he likes the back he moved onto me  everything i know about love and its necessities i learned in that one moment when i found myself  thrusting my little burning red backside like a baboon at a man who no longer cherished me there was no area of my mind  not appalled by this action no part of my body that could have done otherwise but to talk of mind and body begs the question  soul is the place stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind where such necessity grinds itself out  soul is what i kept watch on all that night law stayed with me we lay on top of the covers as if it weren’t really a night of sleep and time  caressing and singing to one another in our madeup language like the children we used to be that was a night that centred heaven and hell  as emily would say we tried to fuck but he remained limp although happy i came again and again each time accumulating lucidity  until at last i was floating high up near the ceiling looking down on the two souls clasped there on the bed with their mortal boundaries  visible around them like lines on a map i saw the lines harden he left in the morning  it is very cold walking into the long scraped april wind at this time of year there is no sunset just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away   kitchen  kitchen is quiet as a bone when i come in no sound from the rest of the house i wait a moment then open the fridge  brilliant as a spaceship it exhales cold confusion my mother lives alone and eats little but her fridge is always crammed after extracting the yogurt container  from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of christmas cake wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles i close the fridge door bluish dusk  fills the room like a sea slid back i lean against the sink white foods taste best to me  and i prefer to eat alone i don’t know why once i heard girls singing a may day song that went  violante in the pantry gnawing at a mutton bone how she gnawed it how she clawed it when she felt herself alone  girls are cruelest to themselves someone like emily brontë who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman  had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow we can see her ridding herself of it at various times with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet  reason with him and then whip him was her instruction age six to her father regarding brother branwell  and when she was 14 and bitten by a rabid dog she strode they say into the kitchen and taking red hot tongs from the back of the stove applied them directly to her arm  cauterization of heathcliff took longer more than thirty years in the time of the novel from the april evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen and vanishes over the moor  because he overheard half a sentence of catherine’s “it would degrade me to marry heathcliff” until the wild morning  when the servant finds him stark dead and grinning on his rainsoaked bed upstairs in wuthering heights heathcliff is a pain devil  if he had stayed in the kitchen long enough to hear the other half of catherine’s sentence “so he will never know how i love him”  heathcliff would have been set free but emily knew how to catch a devil she put into him in place of a soul  the constant cold departure of catherine from his nervous system every time he drew a breath or moved thought she broke all his moments in half  with the kitchen door standing open i am not unfamiliar with this halflife but there is more to it than that  heathcliff’s sexual despair arose out of no such experience in the life of emily brontë so far as we know her question  which concerns the years of inner cruelty that can twist a person into a pain devil came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen “kichin” in emily’s spelling where she  and charlotte and anne peeled potatoes together and made up stories with the old house dog keeper at their feet there is a fragment  of a poem she wrote in 1839 about six years before wuthering heights that says  that iron man was born like me and he was once an ardent boy he must have felt in infancy the glory of a summer sky  who is the iron man my mother’s voice cuts across me from the next room where she is lying on the sofa  is that you dear yes ma why don’t you turn on a light in there  out the kitchen window i watch the steely april sun jab its last cold yellow streaks across a dirty silver sky okay ma what’s for supper   liberty  liberty means different things to different people i have never liked lying in bed in the morning law did my mother does  but as soon as the morning light hits my eyes i want to be out in it moving along the moor into the first blue currents and cold navigation of everything awake  i hear my mother in the next room turn and sigh and sink deeper i peel the stale cage of sheets off my legs and i am free  out on the moor all is brilliant and hard after a night of frost the light plunges straight up from the ice to a blue hole at the top of the sky frozen mud crunches underfoot the sound  startles me back into the dream i was having this morning when i awoke one of those nightlong sweet dreams of lying in law’s  arms like a needle in waterit is a physical effort to pull myself out of his white silk hands as they slide down my dream hipsi  turn and face into the wind and begin to run goblins devils and death stream behind me  in the days and months after law left i felt as if the sky was torn off my life i had no home in goodness anymore  to see the love between law and me turn into two animals gnawing and craving through one another towards some other hunger was terrible  perhaps this is what people mean by original sin i thought but what love could be prior to it what is prior  what is love my questions were not original nor did i answer them  mornings when i meditated i was presented with a nude glimpse of my lone soul not the complex mysteries of love and hate  but the nudes are still as clear in my mind as pieces of laundry that froze on the clothesline overnight there were in all thirteen of them  nude 2 woman caught in a cage of thorns big glistening brown thorns with black stains on them where she twists this way and that way  unable to stand upright nude 3 woman with a single great thorn implanted in her forehead she grips it in both hands  endeavouring to wrench it out nude 4 woman on a blasted landscape backlit in red like hieronymus bosch  covering her head and upper body is a hellish contraption like the top half of a crab with arms crossed as if pulling off a sweater  she works hard at dislodging the crab it was about this time i began telling dr haw  about the nudes she said when you see these horrible images why do you stay with them why keep watching why not  go away i was amazed go away where i said this still seems to me a good question  but by now the day is wide open and a strange young april light is filling the moor with gold milk i have reached the middle  where the ground goes down into a depression and fills with swampy water it is frozen a solid black pane of moor life caught in its own night attitudes  certain wild gold arrangements of weed are visible deep in the black four naked alder trunks rise straight up from it and sway in the blue air each trunk  where it enters the ice radiates a map of silver pressures thousands of hairthin cracks catching the white of the light like a jailed face  catching grins through the bars emily brontë has a poem about a woman in jail who says  a messenger of hope comes every night to me and offers for short life eternal liberty  i wonder what kind of liberty this is her critics and commentators say she means death or a visionary experience that prefigures death  they understand her prison as the limitations placed on a clergyman’s daughter by nineteenthcentury life in a remote parish on a cold moor  in the north of england they grow impatient with the extreme terms in which she figures prison life “in so much of brontë’s work  the selfdramatising and posturing of these poems teeters on the brink of a potentially bathetic melodrama” says one another  refers to “the cardboard sublime” of her caught world i stopped telling my psychotherapist about the nudes when i realized i had no way to answer her question  why keep watching some people watch that’s all i can say there is nowhere else to go  no ledge to climb up to perhaps i can explain this to her if i wait for the right moment as with a very difficult sister  “on that mind time and experience alone could work to the influence of other intellects it was not amenable” wrote charlotte of emily  i wonder what kind of conversation these two had over breakfast at the parsonage “my sister emily  was not a person of demonstrative character” charlotte emphasizes “nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could  with impunity intrude unlicensed   ” recesses were many one autumn day in 1845 charlotte “accidentally lighted on a ms volume of verse in my sister emily’s handwriting”  it was a small 4 x 6 notebook with a dark red cover marked 6d and contained 44 poems in emily’s minute hand  charlotte had known emily wrote verse but felt “more than surprise” at its quality “not at all like the poetry women generally write”  further surprise awaited charlotte when she read emily’s novel not least for its foul language she gently probes this recess  in her editor’s preface to wuthering heights “a large class of readers likewise will suffer greatly from the introduction into the pages of this work  of words printed with all their letters which it has become the custom to represent by the initial and final letter onlya blank line filling the interval”  well there are different definitions of liberty love is freedom law was fond of saying i took this to be more a wish than a thought  and changed the subject but blank lines do not say nothing as charlotte puts it  “the practice of hinting by single letters those expletives with which profane and violent persons are wont to garnish their discourse strikes me as a proceeding which  however well meant is weak and futile i cannot tell what good it doeswhat feeling it spares what horror it conceals”  i turn my steps and begin walking back over the moor towards home and breakfast it is a twoway traffic  the language of the unsaid my favourite pages of the collected works of emily brontë are the notes at the back  recording small adjustments made by charlotte to the text of emily’s verse which charlotte edited for publication after emily’s death “prison for strongestin emily’s hand altered to lordly by charlotte”   hero  i can tell by the way my mother chews her toast whether she had a good night and is about to say a happy thing or not  not she puts her toast down on the side of her plate you know you can pull the drapes in that room she begins   this is a coded reference to one of our oldest arguments from what i call the rules of life series my mother always closes her bedroom drapes tight before going to bed at night  i open mine as wide as possible i like to see everything i say what’s there to see  moon air sunrise all that light on your face in the morning wakes you up i like to wake up  at this point the drapes argument has reached a delta and may advance along one of three channels there is the what you need is a good night’s sleep channel  the stubborn as your father channel and random channel more toast i interpose strongly pushing back my chair  those women says my mother with an exasperated rasp mother has chosen random channel women  complaining about rape all the time i see she is tapping one furious finger on yesterday’s newspaper lying beside the grape jam  the front page has a small feature about a rally for international women’s day have you had a look at the sears summer catalogue  nope why it’s a disgrace those bathing suits cut way up to here she points no wonder  you’re saying women deserve to get raped because sears bathing suit ads have highcut legs ma are you serious  well someone has to be responsible why should women be responsible for male desire my voice is high oh i see you’re one of them  one of whom my voice is very high mother vaults it and whatever did you do with that little tank suit you had last year the green one it looked so smart on you  the frail fact drops on me from a great height that my mother is afraid she will be eighty years old this summer  her tiny sharp shoulders hunched in the blue bathrobe make me think of emily brontë’s little merlin hawk hero that she fed bits of bacon at the kitchen table when charlotte wasn‘t around  so ma we’ll goi pop up the toaster and toss a hot slice of pumpernickel lightly across onto her plate visit dad today she eyes the kitchen clock with hostility  leave at eleven home again by four i continue she is buttering her toast with jagged strokes silence is assent in our code i go into the next room to phone the taxi  my father lives in a hospital for patients who need chronic care about 50 miles from here he suffers from a kind of dementia  characterized by two sorts of pathological change first recorded in 1907 by alois alzheimer first the presence in cerebral tissue  of a spherical formation known as neuritic plaque consisting mainly of degenerating brain cells second neurofibrillary snarlings  in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus there is no known cause or cure mother visits him by taxi once a week  for the last five years marriage is for better or for worse she says this is the worse  so about an hour later we are in the taxi shooting along empty country roads towards town the april light is clear as an alarm  as we pass them it gives a sudden sense of every object existing in space on its own shadow i wish i could carry this clarity with me  into the hospital where distinctions tend to flatten and coalesce i wish i had been nicer to him before he got crazy these are my two wishes  it is hard to find the beginning of dementia i remember a night about ten years ago when i was talking to him on the telephone  it was a sunday night in winter i heard his sentences filling up with fear he would start a sentenceabout weather lose his way start another it made me furious to hear him floundering  my tall proud father former world war ii navigator it made me merciless i stood on the edge of the conversation  watching him thrash about for cues offering none and it came to me like a slow avalanche  that he had no idea who he was talking to much colder today i guess    his voice pressed into the silence and broke off  snow falling on it there was a long pause while snow covered us both well i won’t keep you  he said with sudden desperate cheer as if sighting land i’ll say goodnight now i won’t run up your bill goodbye  goodbye goodbye who are you i said into the dial tone  at the hospital we pass down long pink halls through a door with a big window and a combination lock 5253  to the west wing for chronic care patients each wing has a name the chronic wing is our golden mile  although mother prefers to call it the last lap father sits strapped in a chair which is tied to the wall in a room of other tied people tilting at various angles  my father tilts least i am proud of him hi dad how y’doing his face cracks open it could be a grin or rage  and looking past me he issues a stream of vehemence at the air my mother lays her hand on his hello love she says he jerks his hand away we sit  sunlight flocks through the room mother begins to unpack from her handbag the things she has brought for him grapes arrowroot biscuits humbugs  he is addressing strenuous remarks to someone in the air between us he uses a language known only to himself made of snarls and syllables and sudden wild appeals  once in a while some old formula floats up through the wash you don’t say or happy birthday to you but no real sentence  for more than three years now i notice his front teeth are getting black i wonder how you clean the teeth of mad people  he always took good care of his teeth my mother looks up she and i often think two halves of one thought do you remember that goldplated toothpick  you sent him from harrod’s the summer you were in london she asks yes i wonder what happened to it must be in the bathroom somewhere  she is giving him grapes one by one they keep rolling out of his huge stiff fingers he used to be a big man over six feet tall and strong  but since he came to hospital his body has shrunk to the merest bone house except the hands the hands keep growing each one now as big as a boot in van gogh  they go lumbering after the grapes in his lap but now he turns to me with a rush of urgent syllables that break off on a high notehe waits  staring into my face that quizzical look one eyebrow at an angle i have a photograph taped to my fridge at home  it shows his world war ii air crew posing in front of the plane hands firmly behind backs legs wide apart chins forward  dressed in the puffed flying suits with a wide leather strap pulled tight through the crotch they squint into the brilliant winter sun of 1942  it is dawn they are leaving dover for france my father on the far left is the tallest airman  with his collar up one eyebrow at an angle the shadowless light makes him look immortal  for all the world like someone who will not weep again he is still staring into my face flaps down i cry his black grin flares once and goes out like a match   hot  hot blue moonlight down the steep sky i wake too fast from a cellar of hanged puppies with my eyes pouring into the dark fumbling  and slowly consciousness replaces the bars dreamtails and angry liquids  swim back down to the middle of me it is generally anger dreams that occupy my nights now this is not uncommon after loss of love  blue and black and red blasting the crater open i am interested in anger i clamber along to find the source  my dream was of an old woman lying awake in bed she controls the house by a system of light bulbs strung above her on wires each wire has a little black switch  one by one the switches refuse to turn the bulbs on she keeps switching and switching in rising tides of very hot anger  then she creeps out of bed to peer through lattices at the rooms of the rest of the house the rooms are silent and brilliantly lit  and full of huge furniture beneath which crouch small creaturesnot quite cats not quite rats licking their narrow red jaws  under a load of time i want to be beautiful again she whispers but the great overlit rooms tick emptily  as a deserted oceanliner and now behind her in the dark a rustling sound comes my pajamas are soaked  anger travels through me pushes aside everything else in my heart pouring up the vents every night i wake to this anger  the soaked bed the hot pain box slamming me each way i move i want justice slam  i want an explanation slam i want to curse the false friend who said i love you forever slam i reach up and switch on the bedside lamp night springs  out the window and is gone over the moor i lie listening to the light vibrate in my ears and thinking about curses  emily brontë was good at cursing falsity and bad love and the deadly pain of alteration are constant topics in her verse  well thou halt paid me back my love but if there be a god above whose arm is strong whose word is true this hell shall wring thy spirit too  the curses are elaborate  there go deceiver go my hand is streaming wet my heart’s blood flows to buy the blessingto forget oh could that lost heart give back back again to thine one tenth part of the pain that clouds my dark decline  but they do not bring her peace  vain words vain frenzied thoughts no ear can hear me call lost in the vacant air my frantic curses fall     unconquered in my soul the tyrant rules me still life bows to my control but love i cannot kill  her anger is a puzzle it raises many questions in me to see love treated with such cold and knowing contempt  by someone who rarely left home “except to go to church or take a walk on the hills” charlotte tells us and who  had no more intercourse with haworth folk than “a nun has of the country people who sometimes pass her convent gates”  how did emily come to lose faith in humans she admired their dialects studied their genealogies “but with them she rarely exchanged a word”  her introvert nature shrank from shaking hands with someone she met on the moor what did emily know of lover’s lies or cursive human faith among her biographers  is one who conjectures she bore or aborted a child during her sixmonth stay in halifax but there is no evidence at all for such an event  and the more general consensus is that emily did not touch a man in her 31 years banal sexism aside i find myself tempted  to read wuthering heights as one thick stacked act of revenge for all that life withheld from emily but the poetry shows traces of a deeper explanation  as if anger could be a kind of vocation for some women it is a chilly thought  the heart is dead since infancy unwept for let the body go  suddenly cold i reach down and pull the blanket back up to my chin the vocation of anger is not mine i know my source  it is stunning it is a moment like no other when one’s lover comes in and says i do not love you anymore i switch off the lamp and lie on my back  thinking about emily’s cold young soul where does unbelief begin when i was young  there were degrees of certainty i could say yes i know that i have two hands then one day i awakened on a planet of people whose hands occasionally disappear  from the next room i hear my mother shift and sigh and settle back down under the doorsill of sleep out the window the moon is just a cold bit of silver gristle low on fading banks of sky  our guests are darkly lodged i whispered gazing through the vault      thou  the question i am left with is the question of her loneliness and i prefer to put it off it is morning  astonished light is washing over the moor from north to east i am walking into the light one way to put off loneliness is to interpose god  emily had a relationship on this level with someone she calls thou she describes thou as awake like herself all night and full of strange power  thou woos emily with a voice that comes out of the night wind thou and emily influence one another in the darkness playing near and far at once  she talks about a sweetness that “proved us one” i am uneasy with the compensatory model of female religious experience and yet there is no question  it would be sweet to have a friend to tell things to at night without the terrible sex price to pay this is a childish idea i know  my education i have to admit has been gappy the basic rules of malefemale relations were imparted atmospherically in our family  no direct speech allowed i remember one sunday i was sitting in the backseat of the car father in front  we were waiting in the driveway for mother who came around the corner of the house and got into the passenger side of the car  dressed in a yellow chanel suit and black high heels father glanced sideways at her showing a good bit of leg today mother he said  in a voice which i age eleven thought odd i stared at the back of her head waiting for what she would say her answer would clear this up  but she just laughed a strange laugh with ropes all over it later that summer i put this laugh together with another laugh i overheard as i was going upstairs  she was talking on the telephone in the kitchen well a woman would be just as happy with a kiss on the cheek most of the time but you know men  she was saying laugh not ropes thorns i have arrived at the middle of the moor  where the ground goes down into a low swampy place the swamp water is frozen solid bits of gold weed  have etched themselves on the underside of the ice like messages  i’ll come when thou art saddest laid alone in the darkened room when the mad day’s mirth has vanished and the smile of joy is banished  i’ll come when the heart’s real feeling has entire unbiased sway and my influence o’er thee stealing grief deepening joy congealing shall bear thy soul away  listen ’tis just the hour the awful time for thee dost thou not feel upon thy soul a flood of strange sensations roll forerunners of a sterner power heralds of me  very hard to read the messages that pass between thou and emily in this poem she reverses their roles  speaking not as the victim but to the victim it is chilling to watch thou move upon thou who lies alone in the dark waiting to be mastered  it is a shock to realize that this low slow collusion of master and victim within one voice is a rationale  for the most awful loneliness of the poet’s hour she has reversed the roles of thou and thou not as a display of power  but to force out of herself some pity for this soul trapped in glass which is her true creation  those nights lying alone are not discontinuous with this cold hectic dawn it is who i am  is it a vocation of anger why construe silence as the real presence  why stoop to kiss this doorstep why be unstrung and pounded flat and pine away imagining someone vast to whom i may vent the swell of my soul  emily was fond of psalm 130 “my soul waiteth on thou more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning”  i like to believe that for her the act of watching provided a shelter  that her collusion with thou gave ease to anger and desire ”in thou they are quenched as a fire of thorns“ says the psalmist  but for myself i do not believe this i am not quenched with thou or without thou i find no shelter i am my own nude  and nudes have a difficult sexual destiny i have watched this destiny disclose itself in its jerky passage from girl to woman to who i am now  from love to anger to this cold marrow from fire to shelter to fire what is the opposite of believing in thou  merely not believing in thou no that is too simple that is to prepare a misunderstanding i want to speak more clearly  perhaps the nudes are the best way nude 5 deck of cards each card is made of flesh  the living cards are days of a woman’s life i see a great silver needle go flashing right through the deck once from end to end nude 6 i cannot remember  nude 7 white room whose walls having neither planes nor curves nor angles are composed of a continuous satiny white membrane  like the flesh of some interior organ of the moon it is a living surface almost wet lucency breathes in and out  rainbows shudder across it and around the walls of the room a voice goes whispering be very careful be very careful  nude 8 black disc on which the fires of all the winds are attached in a row a woman stands on the disc  amid the winds whose long yellow silk flames flow and vibrate up through her nude 9 transparent loam  under the loam a woman has dug a long deep trench into the trench she is placing small white forms i don’t know what they are nude 10 green thorn of the world poking up  alive through the heart of a woman who lies on her back on the ground the thorn is exploding  its green blood above her in the air everything it is it has the voice says nude 11 ledge in outer space  space is bluish black and glossy as solid water and moving very fast in all directions shrieking past the woman who stands pinned  to nothing by its pressure she peers and glances for some way to go trying to lift her hand but cannot nude 12 old pole in the wind  cold currents are streaming over it and pulling out into ragged long horizontal black lines  some shreds of ribbon attached to the pole i cannot see how they are attached  notches staples nails all of a sudden the wind changes and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air and tie themselves into knots  then untie and float down the wind is gone it waits  by this time midway through winter i had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama then it stopped  days passed months passed and i saw nothing i continued to peer and glance sitting on the rug in front of my sofa in the curtainless morning  with my nerves open to the air like something skinned i saw nothing outside the window spring storms came and went  april snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches i watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off and fall and i thought  how slow as it glided soundlessly past but stillnothing no nudes no thou  a great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony so i drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle hoping to trick myself into some interior vision  but all i saw was the man and woman in the room across the street making their bed and laughing  i stopped watching i forgot about nudes i lived my life  which felt like a switchedoff tv something had gone through me and out and i could not own it “no need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind  emily does not feel them” wrote charlotte the day after burying her sister emily had shaken free  a soul can do that whether it goes to join thou and sit on the porch for all eternity enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings  you and i will never know but i can tell you what i saw nude 13 arrived when i was not watching for it it came at night  very much like nude 1 and yet utterly different i saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air  it could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached but as i came closer i saw it was a human body  trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones and there was no pain the wind  was cleansing the bones they stood forth silver and necessary it was not my body not a woman’s body it was the body of us all it walked out of the light

 when she rises in the morning i linger to watch her she spreads the bathcloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge and her swung breasts sway like fullblown yellow gloire de dijon roses  she drips herself with water and her shoulders glisten as silver they crumple up like wet and falling roses and i listen for the sluicing of their raindishevelled petals in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold until it glows as mellow as the glory roses

 this is a poem about the great ships that wandered the oceans and groaned sometimes in deep voices grumbling about fog and submerged peaks but usually they sliced the pages of tropical seas in silence divided by height category and class just like our communities and hotels beneath the deck poor emigrants played cards and no one won while on the highest deck claudel gazed at ysé and her hair glowed  and toasts were raised to a safe trip to coming times toasts were raised alsatian wine and champagne from frances finest vineyards some days were static windless when only the light seeped steadily days when nothing happened but the horizon which traveled with the ship days of emptiness and boredom playing solitaire repeating the latest news whod been seen with whom in a tropical nights shade embracing beneath a peachcolored moon  but filthy stokers tirelessly tossed coal into open flaming mouths and everything that is now already existed then but in condensed form our days already existed and our hearts baked in the blazing stove and the moment when i met you may also have existed and my mistrust brittle as a faience plate and my faith no less frail and capricious and my searches for the final answer my disappointments and discoveries  great ships some sunk suddenly arousing consciences and fear gaining deathless fame becoming stars of special bulletins others went peacefully waned without a word in provincial ports in dockyards beneath a coat of rust a ruddy fur of rust a slipcover of rust and waited for the final transformation the last judgment of souls and objects they wait as patiently as chess players in luxembourg garden nudging pieces a fraction of an inch or so

 my ocean town struggles to pick up leaves offer summer school and keep our library open every day now more men stand at the railroad station waiting to be chosen for work because it’s thought the hispanics will work for less they get picked first while the whites and blacks avoid the terror in one another’s eyes our handyman santos who expects only what his hands earn is proud of   his half acre in guatemala where he plans to retire his desire to proceed with dignity is admirable but he knows that now no one retires everyone works harder my father imagined a life more satisfying than the one he managed to lead he didn’t see himself as uneducated thwarted or bitter but soontobe rich being rich was his right he believed happiness i used to think was a necessary illusion now i think it’s just precious moments of relief like dreams of guatemala sometimes at night in winter surrounded by the significant silence of empty mansions which once were cottages where people lived their lives and now are owned by banks and the absent rich i like to stand at my window looking for a tv ’s futile flickering always surprised to see instead the quaint porous face of my reflection immersed in its one abundance

 the monsters that come at night dont breathe fire have two heads or long claws  the monsters that come at night dont come bloody and halfdead and calling your name  they come looking like regular boys going through your drawers and pockets saying  you better not tell counselor else ill beat you down the monsters that come at night snatch  the covers off your bed take your pillow and in the morning  steal your bacon when the cooks back is turned call themselves the throwaway boys say  you one of us now when the relatives stop coming  when you dont know where your sister is anymore when every sign around you says  group home rules dont do this and dont do that  until it sinks in one rainy saturday afternoon while youre sitting at the group home window  reading a beatup group home book wearing a group home handmedown shirt  hearing all the group home loudness that you are a throwaway boy  and the news just sits in your stomach hard and heavy as group home food

 when everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked when their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable they will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers against hills in the cooler hours before dark and the moss at the foot of the forest when green starts to leave it what they take into their privacy half of his embrace her violence at play are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them moons unearth them and when in their separate dwellings their bodies feel the next season come they no longer have anyone to whom to tell it clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness peers back in if they love it is solely to be adored it is to scatter and gather themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set in the quiet woods from the highest trees there is always something weightless falling and he who must realize that certain losses are irreparable tells himself at night before the darkest mirror that vision keeps him whole  on the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves are like sheets of dark water or ice forests or husks of ships to stop a thing such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person’s thoughts the imprint they make on each other’s bodies is worth any pain they may have caused quiet falls around them and when she reaches for him the air greens like underwater light and the wellwaters drop they will see again the shadows of insects they will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed into them if what is no longer present in them cannot be restored it can at least be offered through long bewildered dusks stalks grow rains fill and pass out of clouds animals hover at the edges of fields with eyes like black pools for nothing cannot be transformed pleasure and failure feed each other daily do not think any breeze any grain of light shall be withheld all the stars will sail out for them

 the gregarious dark is shifting when she puts her second drink the free one half on the coaster the tipped wine poised at the brim is the beginning of the bad girl she’ll promise never to be again tomorrow who can taunt him now to prove he doesn’t love her and never could her hand slides up his thigh until he tenses ‘my little prig don’t you want to fuck me’ the bad girl she couldn’t be at home his wife on ice all he can do is smile back as though she’s made a harmless goodnatured joke and struggle not to look around to see who’s heard who’s watching he wants to smash the wine glass in her face so he can know for once exactly what he’s done wrong but he places it instead back safely on the coaster quickly before she sees never cautious enough he is prepared even if she knocks it over to go down on his hands and knees and wipe it up kind and forgiving in all ways careful to acquit himself so that tomorrow when she says she doesn’t deserve him he’s too good he can believe her tomorrow will be his happy hour there won’t be anything she wouldn’t do for him

 if you have a house you must think about it all the time as you reside in the house so it must be a home in your mind  you must ask yourself wherever you are have i closed the front door  and the back door is often forgotten not against thieves necessarily  but the wind   oh   if it blows either door open   then the heat  the heat you’ve carefully nurtured with layers of dry hardwood  and a couple of opposing green brought in to slow the fire  as well as the little pilot light in the convenient gas backup  all of that care will be mocked because you have not kept the house on your mind  but these may actually be among the smallest concerns   for instance  the house could be settling   you may notice the thin slanting line of light  above the doors   you have to think about that luckily you have been paying attention  the house’s dryness can be humidified with vaporizers in each room and pots  of water on the woodstove   should you leave for the movies after dinner   ask yourself  have i turned down the thermometer and moved all wood paper away from the stove  the fiery result of excited distraction could be too horrible to describe  now we should talk especially to northerners of the freezing of the pipe   this can often  be prevented by pumping water continuously through the baseboard heating system  allowing the faucet to drip drip continuously day and night   you must think about the drains  separately   in fact you should have established their essential contribution to the ordinary  kitchen and toilet life of the house digging these drains deep into warm earth  if it hasn’t snowed by middecember you must cover them with hay   sometimes rugs  and blankets have been used   do not be troubled by their monetary value  as this is a regionally appreciated emergency you may tell your friends to consider  your house as their own   that is if they do not wear outdoor shoes  when thumping across the gleam of their poly urethaned floors they must bring socks or slippers  to your house as well   you must think of your house when you’re in it and  when you’re visiting the superior cabinets and closets of others   when you approach  your house in the late afternoon in any weather   green or white   you will catch  sight first of its new aluminum snowresistant roof and the reflections in the cracked windows  its need in the last twentyfive years for paint which has created a lovely design  in russet pink and brown   the colors of un intentioned neglect   you must admire the way it does not  because of someone’s excellent decision sixty years ago stand on the high ridge deforming  the green profile of the hill but rests in the modesty of late middle age under the brow of the hill with  its back to the dark hemlock forest looking steadily out for miles toward the cloud refiguring meadows and  mountains of the next state   coming up the road by foot or auto the house can be addressed personally  house   in the excitement of work and travel to other people’s houses with their interesting improvements  we thought of you often and spoke of your coziness in winter   your courage in wind and fire   your small  airy rooms in humid summer   how you nestle in spring into the leaves and flowers of the hawthorn and the sage green  leaves of the russian olive tree   house   you were not forgotten

 for my son the way a tired chippewa woman who’s lost a child gathers up black feathers black quills amp leaves that she wraps amp swaddles in a little bale a shag cocoon she carries with her amp speaks to always as if it were the child until she knows the soul has grown fat amp clever that the child can find its own way at last well i go everywhere picking the dust out of the dust scraping the breezes up off the floor amp gather them into a doll of you to touch at the nape of the neck to slip under my shirt like a ragthe way another man’s wallet rides above his heart as you cry out as if calling to a father you conjure in the paling light the voice rises instead in me nothing stops it the crying not the clove of moon not the woman raking my back with her words our letters close sometimes you ask about the world sometimes i answer back nights return you to me for a while as sleep returns sleep to a landscape ravaged amp familiar the dark watermark of your absence a hush

 as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved in her laughter and being part of it until her teeth were only accidental stars with a talent for squaddrill i was drawn in by short gasps inhaled at each momentary recovery lost finally in the dark caverns of her throat bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles an elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty green iron table saying “if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden if the lady and gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden ” i decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be stopped some of the fragments of the afternoon might be collected and i concentrated my attention with careful subtlety to this end

 i had just hung up from talking to you and we had been so immersed in the difficulty you were facing and forgive me i was thinking that as long as we kept talking you in your car in the parking lot of the boys’ school as the afternoon deepened into early evening and me in the study all the books around that had been sources of beauty to us as long as we stayed in the conversation padded with history like the floor of the pine forest as long as i thought out loud made a joke at my own expense you would be harbored in that exchange but the boys were leaving the track and after we hung up i looked out the window to see the top of the bare january trees spotlit to silvery red massive but made from the thinnest twigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbs they were waving and shining in a light like no other and left only to them

 the northern lights         i wouldn’t have noticed them if the deer hadn’t told me a doe         her coat of pearls         her glowing hoofs proud and inquisitive eager for my appraisal and i went out into the night with electrical steps but with my head held also proud to share the animal’s fear and see what i had seen before a sky flaring and spectral greenish waves and ribbons and the snow         under strange light         tossing in the pasture like a storming ocean caught by a flaring beacon the deer stands away from me         not far there among bare black apple trees a presence i no longer see we are proud to be afraid proud to share the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars and flickers around our heads like the saints’ cold spiritual agonies of old i remember         but without the sense         other lightstorms cold memories discursive and philosophical in my mind’s burden and the deer remembers nothing we move our feet         crunching bitter snow         while the storm crashes like godwars down the east we shake the sparks from our eyes we quiver inside our shocked fur we search for each other in the apple thicket a glimpse an acknowledgment it is enough and never enough we toss our heads         and say good night moving away on bitter bitter snow

 for susan koethe this is the life i wanted and could never see for almost twenty years i thought that it was enough that real happiness was either unreal or lost or endless and that remembrance was as close to it as i could ever come and i believed that deep in the past buried in my heart beyond the depth of sight there was a kingdom of peace and so i never imagined that when peace would finally come it would be on a summer evening a few blocks away from home in a small suburban park with some children playing aimlessly in an endless light and a lake shining in the distance  eventually sometime around the middle of your life there’s a moment when the first imagination begins to wane the future that had always seemed so limitless dissolves and the dreams that used to seem so real float up and fade the years accumulate but they start to take on a mild human tone beyond imagination like the sound the heart makes pouring into the past its hymns of adoration and regret and then gradually the moments quicken into life vibrant with possibility sovereign dense serene and then the park is empty and the years are still  i think the saddest memory is of a kind of light a kind of twilight that seemed to permeate the air for a few years after i’d grown up and gone away from home it was limitless and free and of course i was going to change but freedom means that only aspects ever really change and that as the past recedes and the future floats away you turn into what you are and so i stayed basically the same as what i’d always been while the blond light in the trees became part of my memory and my voice took on the accents of a mind infatuated with the rhetoric of farewell  and now that disembodied grief has gone away it was a flickering literary kind of sadness the suspension of a life between two other lives of continual remembrance between two worlds in which there’s too much solitude too much disdain but the sadness that i felt was real sadness and this elation now a real tremor as the deepening shadows lengthen upon the lake this calm is real but how much of the real past can it absorb how far into the future can this peace extend  i love the way the light falls over the suburbs late on these summer evenings as the buried minds stir in their graves the hearts swell in the warm earth and the soul settles from the air into its human home this is where the prodigal began and now his day is ending in a great dream of contentment where all night long the children sleep within tomorrow’s peaceful arms and the past is still and suddenly we turn around and smile at the memory of a vast inchoate dream of happiness now that we know that none of it is ever going to be  don’t you remember how free the future seemed when it was all imagination it was a beautiful park where the sky was a page of water and when we looked up there were our own faces shimmering in the clear air and i know that this life is the only real form of happiness but sometimes in its midst i can hear the dense stifled sob of the unreal one we might have known and when that ends and my eyes are filled with tears time seems to have stopped and we are alone in the park where it is almost twenty years ago and the future is still an immense open dream

 i scratch earth around timpsila on this hill while below me hanging in still air a hawk searches the creekbed for my brothers squat leaves i’ll braid your roots into such long ropes they’ll cover the rump of my stallion withered flower feed us now buffalo rot in the waisthigh grass  hear my sisters laugh they dream of feasts of warriors to owl dance with them when this war is over they don’t see our children eating treebark cornstalks these roots their eyes gleam in shallow cheeks the wagon people do not think relationship is wealth  sisters last night the wind returned my prayer allowing me to hear dog soldiers singing at ash hollow i threw away my blanket stained with lies above the wings of my tipi i heard the old woman in maka sica sigh for us then i knew the distance of high back bone’s death fire from another world away even they may never stop its motion  yesterday at noon i heard my cheyenne sister moan as she waded through deep snow before soldiers cut up her corpse to sell as souvenirs are my brothers here ghosts bring all my joy i walk this good road between rock and sky they dare not threaten with death one already dead

 at four o’clock it’s dark today looking out through dusk at three gray women in stretch slacks chatting in front of the post office their steps left and right and back like some quick folk dance of kindness i remembered the winter we spent crying in each other’s laps what could you be thinking at this moment how lovely and strange the gangly spines of trees against a thickening sky as you drive from the library humming offkey or are you smiling at an idea met in a book the way you smiled with your whole body the first night we talked i was so sure my love of you was perfect and the light today reminded me of the winter you drove home each day in the dark at four o’clock and would come into my study to kiss me despite mistake after mistake after mistake

 home’s the place we head for in our sleep boxcars stumbling north in dreams don’t wait for us we catch them on the run the rails old lacerations that we love shoot parallel across the face and break just under turtle mountains riding scars you can’t get lost home is the place they cross  the lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark less tolerant we watch through cracks in boards as the land starts rolling rolling till it hurts to be here cold in regulation clothes we know the sheriff’s waiting at midrun to take us back his car is dumb and warm the highway doesn’t rock it only hums like a wing of long insults the worndown welts of ancient punishments lead back and forth  all runaways wear dresses long green ones the color you would think shame was we scrub the sidewalks down because its shameful work our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear a moment things us kids pressed on the dark face before it hardened pale remembering delicate old injuries the spines of names and leaves

 an end is always punishment for a beginning if you’re catholic sadness is punishment for happiness you become the bug you squash if you’re hindu a flinty space opens in your head after a long night of laughter and wine for waking there are dreams from french poetry english poetry for light fire although sometimes fire must be punished by light which is why psychotherapy had to be invented a father may say nothing to a son for years a wife may keep something small folded deep in her underwear drawer clouds come in resembling the terrible things we believe about ourselves a rock comes loose from a ledge the baby just cries and cries doll in a chair windshield wipers staring off into the city lights for years you may be unable to hear the word monkey without a stab in the heart because she called you that the summer she thought she loved you and you thought you loved someone else and everyone loved your salad dressing and the daffodils come up in the spring and the snow covers the road in winter and the water covers the deep trenches in the sea where all the time the inner stuff of this earth surges up which is how the continents are made and broken

 i walk the purple carpet into your eye carrying the silver butter server but a truck rumbles by leaving its black tire prints on my foot and old images          the sound of banging screen doors on hot afternoons and a fly buzzing over the koolaid spilled on the sink flicker as reflections on the metal surface  come in you said inside your paintings inside the blood factory inside the old songs that line your hands inside eyes that change like a snowflake every second inside spinach leaves holding that one piece of gravel inside the whiskers of a cat inside your old hat and most of all inside your mouth where you grind the pigments with your teeth painting with a broken bottle on the floor and painting with an ostrich feather on the moon that rolls out of my mouth  you cannot let me walk inside you too long inside the veins where my small feet touch bottom you must reach inside and pull me like a silver bullet from your arm

 it had to be from someone whose grandparents were born in shanghai not the city’s greatest citizens but certainly among the sober ones to make their small now eroded mark it had to be from a distant or dissolute descendant yesmoi who can sing praises unworthy of even a flicker of your attention  doesn’t this sound like it might turn into a love poem or a prayer well you are wrong because a man of the people which i am not nor will i ever be doesn’t single out one above all others as this is a hierarchical construction and therefore undemocratic and antihumanist  it had to be from someone whose virtues do not include stubbornness patience gentleness loyalty or truthfulness  it had to be from someone who could take my place after i left the room never to return  it had to be from someone who didn’t exist before this poem began writing itself down

 now spring appears with beauty crowned and all is light and life around why comes not jane when friendship calls why leaves she not augusta’s walls where cooling zephyrs faintly blow nor spread the cheering healthful glow that glides through each awakened vein as skimming o’er the spacious plain we look around with joyous eye and view no boundaries but the sky  already april’s reign is o’er her evening tints delight no more no more the violet scents the gale no more the mist o’erspreads the vale the lovely queen of smiles and tears who gave thee birth no more appears but blushing may with brow serene and vestments of a livelier green commands the winged choir to sing and with wild notes the meadows ring  o come ere all the train is gone no more to hail thy twentyone that age which higher honour shares and well become the wreath it wears from lassitude and cities flee and breathe the air of heaven with me

 for i will consider my cat jeoffry for he is the servant of the living god duly and daily serving him for at the first glance of the glory of god in the east he worships in his way for this is done by wreathing his body seven times round with elegant quickness for then he leaps up to catch the musk which is the blessing of god upon his prayer for he rolls upon prank to work it in for having done duty and received blessing he begins to consider himself for this he performs in ten degrees for first he looks upon his forepaws to see if they are clean for secondly he kicks up behind to clear away there for thirdly he works it upon stretch with the forepaws extended for fourthly he sharpens his paws by wood for fifthly he washes himself for sixthly he rolls upon wash for seventhly he fleas himself that he may not be interrupted upon the beat for eighthly he rubs himself against a post for ninthly he looks up for his instructions for tenthly he goes in quest of food for having considerd god and himself he will consider his neighbour for if he meets another cat he will kiss her in kindness for when he takes his prey he plays with it to give it a chance for one mouse in seven escapes by his dallying for when his days work is done his business more properly begins for he keeps the lords watch in the night against the adversary for he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes for he counteracts the devil who is death by brisking about the life for in his morning orisons he loves the sun and the sun loves him for he is of the tribe of tiger for the cherub cat is a term of the angel tiger for he has the subtlety and hissing of a serpent which in goodness he suppresses for he will not do destruction if he is wellfed neither will he spit without provocation for he purrs in thankfulness when god tells him hes a good cat for he is an instrument for the children to learn benevolence upon for every house is incomplete without him and a blessing is lacking in the spirit for the lord commanded moses concerning the cats at the departure of the children of israel from egypt for every family had one cat at least in the bag for the english cats are the best in europe for he is the cleanest in the use of his forepaws of any quadruped for the dexterity of his defence is an instance of the love of god to him exceedingly for he is the quickest to his mark of any creature for he is tenacious of his point for he is a mixture of gravity and waggery for he knows that god is his saviour for there is nothing sweeter than his peace when at rest for there is nothing brisker than his life when in motion for he is of the lords poor and so indeed is he called by benevolence perpetuallypoor jeoffry poor jeoffry the rat has bit thy throat for i bless the name of the lord jesus that jeoffry is better for the divine spirit comes about his body to sustain it in complete cat for his tongue is exceeding pure so that it has in purity what it wants in music for he is docile and can learn certain things for he can set up with gravity which is patience upon approbation for he can fetch and carry which is patience in employment for he can jump over a stick which is patience upon proof positive for he can spraggle upon waggle at the word of command for he can jump from an eminence into his masters bosom for he can catch the cork and toss it again for he is hated by the hypocrite and miser for the former is afraid of detection for the latter refuses the charge for he camels his back to bear the first notion of business for he is good to think on if a man would express himself neatly for he made a great figure in egypt for his signal services for he killed the ichneumonrat very pernicious by land for his ears are so acute that they sting again for from this proceeds the passing quickness of his attention for by stroking of him i have found out electricity for i perceived gods light about him both wax and fire for the electrical fire is the spiritual substance which god sends from heaven to sustain the bodies both of man and beast for god has blessed him in the variety of his movements for tho he cannot fly he is an excellent clamberer for his motions upon the face of the earth are more than any other quadruped for he can tread to all the measures upon the music for he can swim for life for he can creep

 from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details even as children we noticed all people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny we were reassured our powers had been confirmed but that was a long while ago now we are 60 we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years it is a very suitable dwelling and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord we think he is pleased we notice his transparency we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations  after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus we are small women many people do not notice us while we are noticing them we keep to ourselves mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing mother knew a lot she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach  at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch we set the alarm at 2 and 6 this way we both get some sleep theres always something to see along this road even at 3 in the morning last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons tie them on her arms as if they were wings she climbed up a tree spread her arms and jumped we think she might have injured herself she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance we didnt want to get involved our slippers might have gotten wet it had been raining quite heavily  another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was we were able to read the words on his tattoos ‘dearest jean’ and ‘sailor boy’ we also saw a thin line thru the word ‘jean’ as if he had tried to cut the word out very interesting we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning it didnt take long  we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us then we can read them thru to recall the details they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy we put black velvet covers on these books they are so soft to stroke just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents  there are many folks with bad legs along this road they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world they bandage their legs in different ways some of the bandages are rather grubby you’d think theyd wash them there are plenty of laundromats around here every pension day they could wash them they could share a machine you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions – at least ten bandages dear me if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them they wouldnt be in this predicament we’re so pleased we’re not handicapped we have only ourselves to thank and of course mother  pension morning is always busy we always make sure the teapot is full by 930 the crowd gathers outside the bank for at least  half an hour theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time they clutter the footpath so many of them it takes a while for us to sort out who’s there we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called on our deep cool verandah we sit the twins there are no mirrors in our hallway

 never mind what you think the old man did not rush recklessly into the coop the last minute the chickens hardly stirred for the easy way he sang to them red sun is burning out past slag heaps of the mill the old man touches the blade of his killing knife with his fat thumb i’m in the backyard on a quilt spread out under the heavy dark plums he cooks for his whiskey he walks among the hens singing his chicken song way down in his throat until he finds the one who’s ready and he holds her to his barrel chest  what did you think did you think you just jerk the bird from her roost and hack her head off  beyond the coop i see the fleeting white dress of my grandmother as she crosses and recrosses the porch to fill the bucket with scalding water  how easy the feathers will come when she drowns them for plucking and clouds the air with a stench i can’t stand not to breathe i’m not even a boy yet but i watch the old man sing out into the yard his knife already at the chicken’s throat when everything begins to spin in my world he slices off the head without a squawk and swirls the bird in circles a fine blood spray fanning out far enough to reach me where i wait obediently where i can’t stop watching the head the old man picks up his free hand becomes a puppet chicken clucking at me pecking my head with the cold beak until i cry for him to stop until he pins me down clucking laughing blood all over his hands  he did it so i would remember him i tell myself all these years later he did it because it was his last summer among us in august he didn’t feel the fly come into his cancerous ear and lay its eggs he didn’t feel the maggots hatch as he sat dazed with pills in the sun he pecked my head and laughed out of love out of love he snatched me roughly to his chest and sang his foreign songs way way down in his throat

 the kindness of others is all they ever wanted the laughter of neighbors prospering in the blue light of summer  those of the small sputtering flame and the sudden white sprung hair who feed off envy and grow old quickly desire largesse  the role of poor relation evokes a lack they are not apt to admit or unbearable pity  they prefer to penetrate the giver’s effortless knack of giving they perceive as vitality a pulsating entity  that rewards the kindness of others tenfold this they have witnessed this they have tabulated relentlessly  the generosity of others whose spirits like their longlegged children blossoming into a progeny of orchards and fields flourish  those who have never known kindness drag into the privacy of their smallness the baskets of fruit appearing year after year on their porches  to be picked apart in the hushed posture of thieves they peel skin probe flesh the color of honey  as if the seeds will yield something other than a glimmer of sweet air rising from the roots of trees and licoricelaced halfopened leaves  those of the small flame who feed off envy and grow old quickly live out their lives hungry  glaring at themselves across the table wife of the cruel mouth husband of the thin broth trickling like spittle

jay bancroft amp often marian penner rick clarke across the landing john and susan newlove amp children fathered by gerry gilbert later the ridgeways and next to them directly opposite us gerry geisler new design gallery and helen sturdy amp children  our kitchen faced theirs apple pies in my oven amp stew or toast in theirs we cd smell everything like the time we fell asleep as pork hocks simmered in my big red pot charred and burned almost caught on fire would have if gerry hadnt woken us up and that building a total tinderbox always worried bill wd start one  my bedroom  study faced the molson’s sign and burrard street bridge and i could watch the west end and highrises and planetarium grow and white sheets on a clothesline across the street dry as i’d sit at my bay window and write and mark on a smooth board cut to fit exactly the sill  i’d glance up and see people like  you  amp  jamie  amp  carol  amp  joan  amp  marcia  amp the trumans and the gadds  and the lathams  and lanny beckman walking up and down yew street open the window amp shout drop by on your way back  dropping by everybody did it days filled with coffee tea poetry cigarette smoke crises trips talkedy talk talk  painting hard edged  strong coloured also  intricate silver point mandalas and collages  a gallon of calogna red one summery saturday night became a party of 100 or even more dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder dancing in the other to another drumming in the kitchen talking in the room with the bluetile fireplace so many bodies i couldnt hear the music from  inside the  hallway just saw the taller heads moving together to different beats in almost darkness  that crazy night at the wahs’ place if that wasnt a party of this kind everybody landing on that bed everybody kissing everybody we had to go outside to pee because the lineup for the can so long  somehow to do with that small space that it was so tight that everybody had to rub every body simply to go anywhere it was gorgeous  after the vancouver poetry conference 1963 roy kiyooka started dropping by   when he left his studio there’d always be a light on somewhere in our building and he could visit  any of us separately or clustered  one time he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me but it was big and heavy he borrowed a truck and someone helped him up the dusty always dirty long stairs with hoarfrost which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold my round oak table used to be bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for 80 and when they moved they gave it to joan and then when she moved she stored it with me a wall that later elsa and i tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer shouting angry hexes at robert all the way  after and during that conference olson creeley duncan levertov avison whalen ginsberg roy and i became friends and there were readings in my room every second sunday red cast iron pot full of bean soup corn chowder spicey meatball vegetable stew simmering and then cheese scones in the oven people would come and read their new work one week and the next week there’d be a tish meeting with daphne marlatt dan macleod pete auxier david cull amp david dawson  rent 60 a month didnt change and some years it was cold the wind so cold on side facing the north shore that hydro was 60 per month and that wall frozen behind my pillows  the police were something else they felt they had a right to question anybody so cliff would be up at the laundromat on 4th or at jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend ray wargo would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit where are you going and why and how long will you be  someone was always getting busted someone was always tripping out someone was always visiting from   or going to  europe or japan  here is a journal entry on june 9 evening of the first ever national leaders debate on tv “i am looking forward to seeing trudeauhope he gets pushed intoonto answering more directly than he has in the past i like many others including every gay man i know do have a crush on him he has much more style than any canadian politician so far i mean style in the true sense of the word it is him not affected… cliff of course doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell out i don’t go that far yet but i do think that compromising is the only way a politician can work this country and i do not like all the pr razzmatazz fundraising and allegiances that go into just getting elected our system seems to be based on gullibility…”   coming home at night up yew street whether from downtown or the beach or paul the butcher’s or elsie the baker’s i loved looking up at my northfacing windows goldy  gold  mesh curtains light filtering through so warm  and so inviting

influence linguistics evidence cites the kongo as a specific ethnic source for the ‘language’ and possibly the music of kumina there are varying theories as to whether it was brought with late african arrivants after emancipation or whether it was rooted in jamaica from the 18th century and deepened by    later african influence  ‘kumina is to be found primarily in st thomas and portland and to a lesser extent in st mary st catherine and kingston kumina ceremonies are usually associated with wakes entombments or memorial services but can be performed for a whole range of human experiences

presence known by ‘mounting’ ie possessing a dancer whose given dance style helps in identifying the spirit but can span all possibilities of movement the basic dance posture constitutes an almost erect back and propelling actions of the hips as the feet inch along the ground the dancers move in a circular anticlockwise pattern around the musicians and centre pole either singly or with a partner the arms shoulders ribcage and hips are employed offering the dancers ample opportunity for variations and interpretations of the counterbeats or polyrhythms spins dips and ‘breaks’ on the last beat are common dance variations  ‘the journey of the spirits from the ethereal to the mundane world is no less ritualised than other kumina elements once invoked by music and other ritual

clanking richter rackets like all his blood is floating down her cistern of his wounds are blessed rain this sound win her falling  ears this taste win her mouth like she is givin birth to menance memory  his past somehow his tirelesslessness amp somehow now  his future some where in this past where they are bound in what is almost sound in what is almost light amp outline  win the shadows near the door where they shd pass so they might live  together  as it was before  as it will be before  is what the sound is saying  giving birth to light  her sun  her son  her cinema  the death that is

 dans le simple appareil d’une beauté qu’on vient d’arracher au sommeil smoothed by sleep and ruffled by your dreams the surface of the little lake fed by unconscious tributary streams unbroken by the breezes nightmares make like your face looks fathomless and seems bottomless till light or noises wake you move and murmur and almost awake  i admire but do not wish to enter like any wanderer beside moonlit water in midwinter who as a simulacrum for the tide casting a pebble into the calm centre watches the circles spread from side to side i wait for you and morning at your side  such sources feed the mirror of your mind i dare not touch the surface of your sleep but to love by ignorance resigned infatuated guardian i keep watch beside a fountain where i find no image for images too deep above your breathing regular and deep

 in the clear light that confuses everything only you dark laurel shadow my house  lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake and at night quivering with tears  you are like the tree called tasso’s crippled and hooped with iron it stands on peter’s hill  when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity  that tree makes their own torsion seem natural and so they’re comforted   2 one of the local philosophers  he says “in california we have the old anarchist tradition”  what can he mean is there an anarchist tradition and why would an anarchist want one o california  is there a tree without opinions come let me clasp you let me feel the idea breathing  i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts “the sayling pine the cedar proud and tall”  like the girls in our neighborhood they’re beautiful and silent   3 as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china a lifetime it seemed we gazed at each other  i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods he pointed behind him and i saw  that the hills were covered with armed men and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear  he said “we are as various as the twigs of a tree but now the tree moves as one man  it walks and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving”   4 i said “yet all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing  when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snowwear and all the dead we had to  it was a time of forgetfulness like a plucked string it was a river of darkness  was it not so on your side when you came to the sea that was covered with ships let us speak to each other  let the word rise making dark strokes in the air that bird flies over the heads of the armed men”   5 one part of the tree grows outward the other i saw when with a light i explored the cellarshattering roots  they had broken through the wall as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last  i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles these things are the beginning  of things not visible to the naked eye it was so in the time of tobit the dish glowed when the angel held it  it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning

 i have walked through many lives some of them my own and i am not who i was though some principle of being abides from which i struggle not to stray when i look behind as i am compelled to look before i can gather strength to proceed on my journey i see the milestones dwindling toward the horizon and the slow fires trailing from the abandoned campsites over which scavenger angels wheel on heavy wings oh i have made myself a tribe out of my true affections and my tribe is scattered how shall the heart be reconciled to its feast of losses in a rising wind the manic dust of my friends those who fell along the way bitterly stings my face yet i turn i turn exulting somewhat with my will intact to go wherever i need to go and every stone on the road precious to me in my darkest night when the moon was covered and i roamed through wreckage a nimbusclouded voice directed me “live in the layers not on the litter” though i lack the art to decipher it no doubt the next chapter in my book of transformations is already written i am not done with my changes

 beloved men in thick green coats came crunching through the snow the insignia on their shoulders of uncertain origin a country i could not be sure of a salute so terrifying i heard myself lying to avoid arrest and was arrested along with jocko whose tear had snapped off a tiny icicle he put in his mouth we were taken to the ice prison a palace encrusted with hoarfrost its dome lit from within jocko admired the wiring he kicked the walls to test the strength of his new boots  a television stood in a block of ice its blue image still moving like a liquid center you asked for my innermost thoughts  i wonder will i ever see a grape again  when i think of the vineyard where we met in octoberwhen you dropped a cluster custom insisted you be kissed by a strangerhow after the harvest we plunged into a stream so icy our palms turned pink  it seemed our future was sealed  everyone said so  it is quiet here  not closing our ranks weakens us hugely  the snowflakes fall in a featureless bath  i am the stranger who kissed you  on sunny days each tree is a glittering chandelier  the power of mindless beauty  jocko told a joke and has been dead since may  a bullethole in his forehead the officers call a third eye  for a month i milked a barnful of cows  it is a lot like cleansing a chandelier  wipe and polish wipe and polish round and round you go i have lost my spectacles  is the book i was reading still open by the side of our bed  treat it as a bookmark saving my place in our story  here the letter breaks off

 there is another world but it is in this one  paul eluard  first there were those who died before i was born it was as if they had just left and their shadows would slip out after them under the door so recently closed the air in its path was still swirling to rest some of the furniture came from them i was told and one day i opened two chests of drawers to learn what the dead kept  but it was when i learned to read that i began always to live among the dead i remember rapunzel the improved animals in the justso stories and a flock of birds that saved themselves from a hunter by flying in place in the shape of a tree their wings imitating the whisk of wind in the leaves  my sons and i are like some wine the dead have already bottled they wish us well but there is nothing they can do for us sebastian cries in his sleep i bring him into my bed talk to him rub his back to help his sons live easily among the dead is a father’s great work now sebastian drifts soon he’ll sleep we can almost hear the dead breathing they sound like water under a ship at sea  to love the dead is easy they are final perfect but to love a child is sometimes to fail at love while the dead look on with their abstract sorrow  to love a child is to turn away from the patient dead it is to sleep carefully in case he cries  later when my sons are grown among their own dead i can dive easily into sleep and loll among the coral of my dreams growing on themselves until at the end i almost never dream of anyone except my sons who is still alive

 as we drove back crossing the hill the house still hidden in the trees i always thought a fool’s fearthat it might have caught fire someone could have broken in as if things must have been too good here still we always found it locked tight safe and sound  i mentioned that once as a joke no doubt we spoke of the absurdity to fear some dour god’s jealousy of our good fortune from the farm next door our neighbors saw no harm came to the things we cared for here what did we have to fear  maybe i should have thought all such things rot fall barns houses furniture we two are stronger than we were apart we’ve grown together everything we own can burn we know what countssome such idea we said as much  we’d watched friends driven to betray felt that love drained away some self they need we’d said love like a growth can feed on hate we turn in and disguise we warned ourselves that you might despise mehate all we both loved best none of us ever guessed  the house still stands locked as it stood untouched a good two years after you went some things passed in the settlement some things slipped away enough’s left that i come back sometimes the theft and vandalism were our own maybe we should have known

   one hundred breaths split the air as i lean on the only pine tree i find it’s early or late it’s breezy or hot the fields are dry summer is near the horses are everywhere strangely galloping a dream but i can’t remember how to call them so i stand back watch them pass     the first time i rode a horse my body found the music of fire crackling the wind an unbearable pleasure that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg a sign the horsekeeper told meof longing a need to returnto belong after all departure is like pushing the weight of our heart against the village whose name has kept us awake     rafael came from somewhere in eurasia i passed my hands through his mane saw a history of conquests and battles a field of hay a mount of truth heard a silent ring his eyes asking me to go with him to confess something sacred to name something lustful nothing of where he came from or who i was disturbed us     i knew he was different by the way he ran without pause without grace without distraction without ease he was told how to move in the world and resented it he knew he would never own anything     he came toward me it was a quiet afternoon i stood unmoving and we listened to the untitled music circling the earth like an anthem free of its nation     he was unfamiliar to me approaching as if he possessed the land every morning he stopped five feet from the river

 on the telephone friends mistake us now when we first say hellonot after and that oddly optimistic lilt we share nourishes my hopes we do sound happy     last night in my dream’s crib a oneday infant girl i wasn’t totally unprepared there was the crib and cotton kimonos not just a padded dresser drawer  and then i knew i could drive to the store for the tiny funny clothes my daughter wears  i was in a familiar room and leaned over the rail crooning hello and the smiling baby she’d be too young for speech i know or smiles gurgled back at mehullo  if i could begin again i’d hold her longer closer maybe that way when night opens into morning and all my windows gape at the heartbreaking street my dreams wouldn’t pierce so  i wouldn’t hold my breath at the parts of my life still in hiding my childhood’s white house where i lunged toward the flowers of love as if i were courting death     over the crib a mobile was spinning bright birds going nowhere primary colors primary as mothering once seemed     later i wonder why i dreamt that dream yearning for what i’ve had and have  why it was my mother’s room the blonde moderne bedroom set hidden under years of junka spare room’s the nicest way to put it  though now all her crowded rooms are spare

 i  i’ve felt undeserving i’ve made myself ill with the glory in the unleavened garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake what made me cover that which i could not have  i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs i’ve felt undeserving i’ve made myself ill with the glory even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation i disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent’s hiss  i remember seasons things i bring from far away and grieve i walk in catacombs in gardens now by the stone walls sunlight closes the falling leaves gesture their renunciation  i remember being in a field touching a man’s body i remember seasons things i bring from far away and things that hold their breath for shame his skin was soft as a girl’s and he closed his eyes  i placed apple petals on his eyelids we were lying in a field and i touched his body then there were clouds an uncanny silence as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame  what made me covet what i could not have ill with the power and glory a thrashing in my chest i remember the unleavened gardens petals falling singly the yellow snake disgorging lies   ii  i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs i’ve felt undeserving i’ve made myself ill with the glory power and glory a thrashing in my rib cage  i’ve gone into the unleavened spring garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs  what made me cover that which i could not have i’ve felt undeserving in this bright land that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow i remember seasons things i bring with me from far away  and things that hold their breath as if for shame i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory i’ve gone into the unleavened garden and startled a yellow snake  disgorging lies a thrashing in my rib cage what made me cover what i could not have i remember   seasons things that hold their breath for shame things i bring with me from far away   iii  i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory

 a monodrama come into the garden maud for the black bat night has flown come into the garden maud i am here at the gate alone and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad and the musk of the rose is blown  for a breeze of morning moves and the planet of love is on high beginning to faint in the light that she loves in a bed of daffodil sky to faint in the light of the sun she loves to faint in his light and to die  all night have the roses heard the flute violin bassoon all night has the casement jessamine stirrd to the dancers dancing in tune till a silence fell with the waking bird and a hush with the setting moon  i said to the lily there is but one with whom she has heart to be gay when will the dancers leave her alone she is weary of dance and play now half to the setting moon are gone and half to the rising day low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away  i said to the rose the brief night goes in babble and revel and wine o young lordlover what sighs are those for one that will never be thine but mine but mine so i sware to the rose for ever and ever mine  and the soul of the rose went into my blood as the music clashd in the hall and long by the garden lake i stood for i heard your rivulet fall from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood our wood that is dearer than all  from the meadow your walks have left so sweet that whenever a marchwind sighs he sets the jewelprint of your feet in violets blue as your eyes to the woody hollows in which we meet and the valleys of paradise  the slender acacia would not shake one long milkbloom on the tree the white lakeblossom fell into the lake as the pimpernel dozed on the lea but the rose was awake all night for your sake knowing your promise to me the lilies and roses were all awake they sighd for the dawn and thee  queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls come hither the dances are done in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls queen lily and rose in one shine out little head sunning over with curls to the flowers and be their sun  there has fallen a splendid tear from the passionflower at the gate she is coming my dove my dear she is coming my life my fate the red rose cries she is near she is near and the white rose weeps she is late the larkspur listens i hear i hear and the lily whispers i wait  she is coming my own my sweet were it ever so airy a tread my heart would hear her and beat were it earth in an earthy bed my dust would hear her and beat had i lain for a century dead would start and tremble under her feet and blossom in purple and red

 a monodrama o that twere possible after long grief and pain to find the arms of my true love round me once again  when i was wont to meet her in the silent woody places by the home that gave me birth we stood tranced in long embraces mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter than anything on earth  a shadow flits before me not thou but like to thee ah christ that it were possible for one short hour to see the souls we loved that they might tell us what and where they be  it leads me forth at evening it lightly winds and steals in a cold white robe before me when all my spirit reels at the shouts the leagues of lights and the roaring of the wheels  half the night i waste in sighs half in dreams i sorrow after the delight of early skies in a wakeful doze i sorrow for the hand the lips the eyes for the meeting of the morrow the delight of happy laughter the delight of low replies  tis a morning pure and sweet and a dewy splendour falls on the little flower that clings to the turrets and the walls tis a morning pure and sweet and the light and shadow fleet she is walking in the meadow and the woodland echo rings in a moment we shall meet she is singing in the meadow and the rivulet at her feet ripples on in light and shadow to the ballad that she sings  so i hear her sing as of old my bird with the shining head my own dove with the tender eye but there rings on a sudden a passionate cry there is some one dying or dead and a sullen thunder is rolld for a tumult shakes the city and i wake my dream is fled in the shuddering dawn behold without knowledge without pity by the curtains of my bed that abiding phantom cold  get thee hence nor come again mix not memory with doubt pass thou deathlike type of pain pass and cease to move about tis the blot upon the brain that will show itself without  then i rise the eavedrops fall and the yellow vapours choke the great city sounding wide the day comes a dull red ball wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke on the misty rivertide  thro the hubbub of the market i steal a wasted frame it crosses here it crosses there thro all that crowd confused and loud the shadow still the same and on my heavy eyelids my anguish hangs like shame  alas for her that met me that heard me softly call came glimmering thro the laurels at the quiet evenfall in the garden by the turrets of the old manorial hall  would the happy spirit descend from the realms of light and song in the chamber or the street as she looks among the blest should i fear to greet my friend or to say forgive the wrong or to ask her take me sweet to the regions of thy rest  but the broad light glares and beats and the shadow flits and fleets and will not let me be and i loathe the squares and streets and the faces that one meets hearts with no love for me always i long to creep into some still cavern deep there to weep and weep and weep my whole soul out to thee

 summoned by conscious recollection she would be smiling they might be in a kitchen talking before or after dinner but they are in this other room the window has many small panes and they are on a couch embracing he holds her as tightly as he can she buries herself in his body morning maybe it is evening light is flowing through the room outside the day is slowly succeeded by night succeeded by day the process wobbles wildly and accelerates weeks months years the light in the room does not change so it is plain what is happening they are trying to become one creature and something will not have it they are tender with each other afraid their brief sharp cries will reconcile them to the moment when they fall away again so they rub against each other their mouths dry then wet then dry they feel themselves at the center of a powerful and baffled will they feel they are an almost animal washed up on the shore of a world or huddled against the gate of a garden to which they can’t admit they can never be admitted

 by this he knew she wept with waking eyes that at his hands light quiver by her head the strange low sobs that shook their common bed were called into her with a sharp surprise and strangled mute like little gaping snakes dreadfully venomous to him she lay stonestill and the long darkness flowed away with muffled pulses then as midnight makes her giant heart of memory and tears drink the pale drug of silence and so beat sleeps heavy measure they from head to feet were moveless looking through their dead black years by vain regret scrawled over the blank wall like sculptured effigies they might be seen upon their marriagetomb the sword between each wishing for the sword that severs all

 it ended and the morrow brought the task her eyes were guilty gates that let him in by shutting all too zealous for their sin each sucked a secret and each wore a mask but oh the bitter taste her beauty had he sickened as at breath of poisonflowers a languid humour stole among the hours and if their smiles encountered he went mad and raged deep inward till the light was brown before his vision and the world forgot looked wicked as some old dull murderspot a star with lurid beams she seemed to crown the pit of infamy and then again he fainted on his vengefulness and strove to ape the magnanimity of love and smote himself a shuddering heap of pain

 in our old shipwrecked days there was an hour when in the firelight steadily aglow joined slackly we beheld the red chasm grow among the clicking coals our librarybower that eve was left to us and hushed we sat as lovers to whom time is whispering from suddenopened doors we heard them sing the nodding elders mixed good wine with chat well knew we that lifes greatest treasure lay with us and of it was our talk ah yes love dies i said i never thought it less she yearned to me that sentence to unsay then when the fire domed blackening i found her cheek was salt against my kiss and swift up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift now am i haunted by that taste that sound

 i  the question is not how like the animals we are but how we got that way we laugh for what is a suicide note  but the epitaph of an emotion few of us die out in the open and when you say thesis i say antithesis  but we don’t stop there we take our opposing ideas plant them on opposing cliffs and then build a footbridge  between them seemingly flimsy yet sturdy enough in fact to support a battalion hidden behind trees we watch  the soldiers march across it single file too scared to look down we cheer them all all except the boy  in the fairy tale who knew no fear him we pity he laughs openeyed ready to die as we were not  he is one of us all right but better stronger stranger he asks for more fear than anyone can bear   ii  the guilty had three choices awkward chords of candor canned laughter or the wild hyacinth’s sutra before  silence returned triumphant and the journey resumed in darkness though the sky above was classically blue  everyone kept his opinion to himself as harmony dictated and effigies of tristan and isolde  accompanied their stubborn footsteps across the wild terrain yet the longing for a loud catharsis  at night renewed their pain “if only we could climb out of these clouds and heartfelt headaches  like ravished children in the glory of a snowball fight after school and never again have to descend  who would not abandon these erotic shipwrecks and fall asleep like tigers in the destined heights”   iii  at a festival of conceptual art in cairo i saw a tank buried entirely in snow  i knew then that silence is the source of all music all laughter all thought and so  i stuffed pebbles in my mouth and stood by the sea and roared my defiance of the waves it was here  years before that our plane and its shadow converged i ran from the fire carrying the flames  in my arms i ran and ran feeling like a man fighting a newspaper on a windy beach but it wasn’t  a beach at all the sand beneath me was snow is snow and the spears in the desert sky look like stars  in the pyramid’s triangular shadow i was the man who heard the crimson explosion and ran and ran   iv  keats in one of his letters says “my imagination is a monastery and i am its monk” i wonder  if a man’s imagination is his monastery this place looks a lot like an empty railway station  king’s cross in london or the gare st lazare in paris a place whose smoke and fog monet dissolved  into a chorus of colors there we stood my love and i having made our vows under the suspended clock  hero and bride but as we walked away side by side down the station’s sunless nave amid the excitement  of the crowd and foreign languages spoken loud we knew our exile had already begun could hear  the conductor’s shrill whistle could see the light at the end of the tunnel where the battlefields begin   v  paradise was hardly what psyche with her bleeding blackberries and nervous orgasms  could have foretold enjoyed and renounced for the sake of some querulous abstraction  designed to keep us unhappy but alive call it civilization call our disobedience instinctive  or say we obeyed an angry muse who ordered us to dance “or else” i asked she sighed before answering  “or else a dismal armchair will be your lot with chamber music your sole narcoticmusic that will make  you face your former self and grieve over incidents scarcely recalled and eat without pleasure and drink  without thirst and dread what shall never come to pass” in the revelation of our nakedness we danced   vi  “a ball that is caught is fuller by the weight of its return than the same ball thrown” our empty hands say so  we feel free in the other room the true believers remain the ones who insist that evil is real the only real thing  cannibals and missionaries they are accomplices in sin greedy for punishment to inflict or endure it  we are glad to leave them behind glad not to have to hear their chants and wails down the elevator we go  and out into the canyon created by skyscraper shadows yet even we dedicated as we are to good living  sometimes walk around with a lost look on our faces as if the blessing for a piece of fruit or cup of wine  had suddenly come to mind though cup and plate are empty had come to mind and faded almost instantly away   vii  admit it you used to walk around thinking there had to be a reason for things for everything that way  paranoia lies not a science of syllables the solitude total but the prophet’s lit lantern was what you wanted  and what you got was “neon in daylight” a pleasure recommended by frank o’hara those pleasures meant a lot to you  you even thought you lived for them until the first death a nervous uncle broke the news when you landed at kennedy  and the first marriage you stayed up all night and read beyond the pleasure principle a fair description  of your lovemaking it seems that new myths are needed and consumed all the time by folks like you each erases the last  producing tomorrow’s tabula rasa after a night of dreams in which the tigers of wrath become the tigers of repose   viii   go back to the beginning to the first fist fight they played for high stakes those days the penalty for losing  was death or slavery take your pick to spare a life was the mark of the master the mark of his slave  was fear noble savage nothing forget about paradise my vote goes to hobbes’s “life of man solitary poor  nasty brutish and short” an amazing sentence the syllable that ends it also lends it its poignancy  since we go on wanting what we can scarcely bear go back go back back to when god became a swan  with beautiful wounded wings and raped the astonished maiden back to the dream that stays real when you wake up  accustomed to your hunger and clinging to it like a panther accustomed to his cage go back   ix  a slap in the face and the face burns with shame anger comes later comes stranger looking for someone to blame  end of message can’t see the stars can’t say anything that hasn’t been said before  by somebody slamming the door can only repeat the syntax that brought the crowd to its feet  in the silence that appeased the nightingale end of tale but its moral was simple  i lost the hearing in one of my ears and listened with the other to a deaf man’s  symphony he built a heaven out of his fears that there wasn’t one end of nightmare  the imperfect past going by too fast begged us to collect it it couldn’t last    x  the doctor put his cards on the table “take your pick” he said he was able  to offer me fear of extinction or fear of pain though freedom from neither “you mustn’t complain”  in the vertiginous air the monks wore masks to keep their germs to themselves and their  identities a secret a hero to his own valet the sultan choreographed his murderous ballet  until scheherazade entering the circus tent with john the baptist’s head on a silver tray  told her tale and made the crowd repent the curtain dropped and the crowd went on its way  but no one could say what the nightmare meant or why it was sent to us or by whom it was sent   xi  you can’t have it so you want it or you couldn’t have it so you no longer want it or  you’re stuck with it forever it was designed with you in mind like the locked door that swung open majestically when you  spoke the magic words or just answered in the affirmative when your name was called “here i am ready to meet you  ready to make any sacrifice” you said still in bed wrestling with an evil angel  in your sleep you were seventeen years old then and woke up with a limp desire is like that  the girl knows what you want and cries when she gives it to you because it was yours because  she whispered your name in your sleeping ear and said “here i am” and was gone a minute later   xii  i met her in one of those sleazebag bars i think it was called the bottom linein buffalo  selfproclaimed “city of no illusions” where silent men in shirtsleeves sit on bar stools and watch  girls with tattoos on their buttocks strip down to gstrings and panties they dance to the thump  of moronic music grind and hump under hot strobe lights and then when the act is over circulate among the scumbags  gyrating in front of each in turn making each feel special and each aroused by the mingled smell of musk and sweat  folds a dollar and sticks it into her crotch for a tip she was different when i left the bar that night i knew  she would follow and she did and i never looked back never glanced at the rearview mirror all other women turned into her   xiii  her name was mary but was miriam before that and soon she will change it to alice what she offered was a shadow  the shape of europe on the map above the bed of my youth her shawl is all that remains of europe in the downstairs closet  it was forbidden to lift up her skirt and look look yet boys and girls danced across the bridal morning like a bridge  as the wings of the fog like white sails lingered across the bay i flew like a caterpillar with wings into a new day  that was the day we buried europe we built a dome in air and in the icy silence of the tomb to hang like a spider  on a subway strap seemed a suitable fate for some but we lit a candle and watched it cast the shadow of a mountain  in a valley it was the awful shadow of some unseen power a heaven in a wild flower europe bloody europe was gone   xiv  in the dream of your choice you wake up in the garden of eden alone except for a whore with a heart  wearing a nurse’s uniform the serpent says listen carefully this is for your own good  at the tone it will be eight o’clock nine out of ten physicians recommend  that you surround yourself with the kind of sorrows that can be instantly relieved by frivolous kisses  with vegetables as lush as fruits ripening in your hands when the hospital gates are opened  don’t hesitate run and when you arrive at last in the land of the free take your place in line with all of the others  as though nothing had happened between then and now to make you doubt the conviction that you’re blessed   xv  if you were a painter you’d paint the wind green it would shake the boughs of the honey locust trees  it would chase the leaves across the continent it would scatter their crumbs in a twist of swirling snow  it would be colorless and green at the same time the wind that aligns the pond and the cloud  the wind that is everywhere in constant motion as buoyant as ariel and as scornful of gross caliban  the wind that holds up the fly ball drives it back into fair territory causes it to drift within reach  of the rightfielder who waves off the second baseman until a last gust lifts the ball over both their heads  and it lands safely for the double that ends the game in extra innings costing our team the pennant   xvi  after the flood refreshed was the first time you realized that the road to truth was the road  of flagrant fiction you surrounded yourself with symbols a mountain a window an ark  a rainbow and mythic creatures the dove that returned and the raven that didn’t you understood the dream  of the old woman who interpreted the sailor’s dream then came the other birds the clouds that come  when the rain is done and the wind that signals the discovery of dry land a new continent  as the report of a gun sounds the start of the race as the bottle broken beneath the bridegroom’s foot  begins the marriage as church bells start the funeral parade and all the townspeople march in the procession   xvii  no longer is there freedom in confusion nor forgiveness in confession  nor charm in the old illusion of moonlight the tower the howling dog the escaping lovers  escaping into midnight in the western hemisphere when the possibilities of expansion still seemed limitless  and the soul could choose among stars without number in the vast velvet night without end  in the midst of other woe than ours i went to the window and cured the solitude of the listeners outside  who shivered in the rain waiting for the police to come and ambulance sirens to sound drunk i was when  i went to the bathroom looked in the mirror and said “dad dad is that you” in the terror of the night   xviii  “wherever you follow” he said “i will lead” where summer met fall she picked up a brittle orange leaf  he wanted to lie on the grass to lean and loaf at his ease but the crisis intervened news of her unpaid loan  prompted him to put his sandals on his head as in the zen koan slowly he walked away silence followed then the sound of a moan  in the room next door so orange it seemed a painted moon shone against the indigo sky and quickly her mood  went from unreasonable euphoria to realistic dejection as the wood in the fireplace turned to ash without first yielding a flame the wool  of their sweaters had begun to unravel “if the fool persists in his folly“ someone said “he will have food  enough to eat loaves and fishes galore worship the good which is beautiful though untrue turn your back on gold”   xix  if we were painters we’d favor vibrant stripes primary colors flat surfaces a lot of white  remaining on the canvas if we were composers we’d take the music of exotic jungles with us  when we visit the vast vacant tundra “if i were rich enough” vowed the philanthropist “i’d move  to a magnolia mansion and spend my days translating modern literature into ancient greek”  great plans distant vistas a rearguard action to sabotage the presentand here we’ve all assembled  at the antiseptic airport with haunted looks on our faces occasional eye contact between man with tan and woman in white  “you look like your voice” she says breaking the silence the rest of us know where we’re going but we don’t know when   xx  they’ve cornered the market on moral outrage yes they have the more noise they make about it the more nervous we get  they’re always telling us just how shallow we are the only convictions we have they say are on our driver’s licenses  the charge is not entirely fair to us though it has its grain of truth we tend to luxuriate in our indecisiveness not they no one can say  they lack conviction and passion and certitude we have our doubts which make us less glamorous and give us  the haunted look we wear but something in defense of our bemused spectatorship must be said at least it spares us  the postures of those hypocrite lechers brothers and others who sublimate their sexuality into opulent rhetoric and chide us  for not doing the same they have our best interests at heart they may even be happier than we are we have our doubts   xxi  today’s graffiti is in the sky “more than meets the eye” growing up i could tell the months by their smell  first come the fruitstand smells of spring in the city then the backyard trees get back their green and we know  it’s the real thing poetry is this puzzle of missing parts is best represented by clouds in the early evening sky  because they constantly change shape are utterly indifferent to us and seem both remote and near at hand  at once the creation of the world is a ballet with the dancers and music missing what you see  is a miniature stageset in a museum display case and then suddenly you are walking in it along the boulevard raspail  until the eiffel tower comes into view watch it organize the bridges of the seine into a coherent surprise   xxii  love accompanies the stranger to his streetlamp encircled by signing insects the song he hears  meant doom or wax in the mariners’ ears and now as the smell of fresh cut grass gives way to the smell  of brown leaves burning i want to tell you what i heard that night and how the day  erased it i woke to the rattle of a passing car which accelerating up the rapidly rising ramp  seemed delighted with its capacity for making noise from far away i could hear it coming and just as we know that fame isn’t all  it’s cracked up to be that it can be downright nasty in fact and yet we want it anyway  so i too knew i belonged in one of those cars tall behind the steering wheel racing to meet the changing light   xxiii  winter came last waves of snow from who knows which wind turned the meadow beside the frozen waterfall  into an ocean the boy in the fairy tale who knew no fear soon learned on the shore of the wide world he could hear  the violins of anger spelling danger poetry in this era of disbelief meant staring at a leaf until it turned into a star  it was easier in the past all you had to do was sleep outside and let nature take over there were more stars in the sky  than we had room for in our philosophy and when we woke berries grew beside the burbling brook and bled in our soft hands  the question was not how like the gods we were but whether we could recognize them in our sleep  and remember what we had seen remember them clearly when the radio alarm welcomes us into its next musical day   xxiv  i live in a boat in front of the door depicting the gods as they might have been forgotten  by lazarus during the tortures of interrogation what i see are tombs and yellow stains on the snow  instead of quotations i will refer to my heart instead of an altar i will guard the munitions  and drink wine with the sour taste of cork and eat sour strawberries in the city of new york  you who’ve been looking for a lost address and mothers who seem to be fighting back their tears  what made you think you could resist the roar of the years as they echo in a cavernous subway station  can you see the boat in front of the door what was it you forgot during the interrogation   xxv  ovid had it wrong the plight of the frightened maiden gliding noiselessly into the woods like a deer whose eyes  had been mesmerized by headlights on a cold november night was implausible without the contrivance of arrows love’s dart  claimed apollo while the dart of fear pierced daphne’s heart and so she ran deeper and deeper into the woods losing ground  all the while to apollo for love moved faster than fear until the gods granting her wish turned the nymph  into a laurel which apollo hopelessly embraced poetic justice yes except it didn’t happen that way their foot race ended  in a forest clearing where daphne exhausted but unashamed made apollo watch her undress he entered her  at her request as if his will were an extension of her own the trees inclining their branches nodded in consent love won   xxvi  the boy who was more eager than his father to live on a raft sleep in the woods and study the stars  became his father but not before he hid in a cave slept in it overnight and was saved by a spider from sure destruction  the king’s soldiers hot on his trail saw the web stretch unbroken in the mouth of the cave and assumed that no one was there  what is the correct interpretation of the spider’s web to the soldiers it meant desolation to the spider conquest  to the grandfather telling the tale providence the boy sees the dew cling to the web at dawn the natural camouflage  of rabbits and snakes isn’t lost on him he notices the triangle formed by three birds in the barebranched sycamore  he can hear the hum of a bee admiring a tulip’s genitalia and at night he knows all the colors are present in the white of the stars   xxvii  that was the year i first read h ö lderlin the evening fell more slowly and the first day of spring  arrived more suddenly and stayed lovelier longer boys pursued muses and girls impersonated them  with the instinct of insects he and she on the meadow mate what they dreamed stays real when they wake up  in the evening of the first day of spring did they fall out of paradise or were they pushed  it’s unclear but we next see them enter the gathering dusk hand in hand and the camera pulls back and the voiceover says  “good fortune is even harder to bear than the bad fortune that came first remember this  about the gods their own immortality suffices them the source of all rivers is a riddle even i cannot solve”   xxviii  how little i have changed since then or how much of the change is in the eyes of the beholder  of a book i lived rather than wrote whose author seems like a stranger to me today i remember  for example wanting to write an apocalyptic parody of milton in milton’s high style titled “eden in flames”  adam and eve celebrated their carnality and when they woke the branches of the fruit trees curved gracefully down  and served them nectar i couldn’t bring myself to describe their banishment and so the project failed yet what i heard  when i slept sounded a lot like the chorus of joy in beethoven’s ninth and what i saw when i woke up  if only for the length of a dream was a deer eyes mesmerized by headlights motionless in the middle of the road   xxix  you could be the only passenger on the bus who notices that the driver is blind i by contrast  have eyes only for lovely you give me your hand i will kiss it you are cordially invited to my studio  which resembles a psychiatrist’s office once there i put on my glasses read passages out loud from plato hobbes marx and freud  and ask you for your opinion of each together we analyze solitude there is a meeting of the minds  and sex follows it’s the first day of spring and we want to walk along the river and roll on the grass and take off  our clothes while leaving the windows wide open in fact we can’t wait to get off this bus which seems to be going  nowhere fast as spring puts her tongue in my ear and names the forbidden parts of her body   xxx  no one could say what the nightmare meant in the operating theater or the circus tent  and none of this will help us pay the rent many are called and sleep through the ringing  but we know it’s spring though we’ve thrown our watches away our dreams stretching across the chasm of day  don’t deter us from waking jumping into our clothes dancing down the avenue and swinging through  the revolving doors of the future where we used to live the day before yesterday when we weren’t dying  the question is whether the raven will return after his endoftheworld adventures after the storm  when one by one the masks slip off and the bride embraces the guilty son true to the test remembered and confessed

 i gave you sorrow to hang on your wall like a calendar in one color i wear a torn place on my sleeve it isn’t as simple as that  between no place of mine and no place of yours you’d have thought i’d know the way by now just from thinking it over oh i know i’ve no excuse to be stuck here turning like a mirror on a string except it’s hardly credible how it all keeps changing loss has a wider choice of directions than the other thing  as if i had a system i shuffle among the lies turning them over if only i could be sure what i’d lost i uncover my footprints i poke them till the eyes open they don’t recall what it looked like when was i using it last was it like a ring or a light or the autumn pond which chokes and glitters but grows colder it could be all in the mind  anyway nothing seems to bring it back to me  and i’ve been to see your hands as trees borne away on a flood the same film over and over and an old one at that shattering its account to the last of the digits and nothing and the blank end  the lightning has shown me the scars of the future  i’ve had a long look at someone alone like a key in a lock without what it takes to turn  it isn’t as simple as that  winter will think back to your lit harvest for which there is no help and the seed of eloquence will open its wings when you are gone but at this moment when the nails are kissing the fingers goodbye and my only chance is bleeding from me when my one chance is bleeding for speaking either truth or comfort i have no more tongue than a wound

 i should be happy with my lot a wife and mother – is it not enough for me to be content what other blessing could be sent  a quiet house and homely ways that make each day like other days i only see time’s shadow now darken the hair on baby’s brow  no world’s work ever comes to me no beggar brings his misery i have no power no healing art with bruised soul or broken heart  i read the poets of the age ’tis lotuseating in a cage i study art but art is dead to one who clamors to be fed  with milk from nature’s rugged breast who longs for labor’s lusty rest o foolish wish i still should pine if any other lot were mine

 ice on the puddles in the cups of fallen leaves i’d walk with dad and a handful of other men the setters working the fields the underbrush it was my job to carry the birds i’d have them all plucked by the time we got back to the car on the walk out i’d look for puddles i’d missed and break them  though many moonless nights have fallen on the grave like a negative of snow dad’s wheelchair sometimes flashes in my mind and i hear the bleating down the hall a voice berating its god his worthless anodynes and the doctors who were at that very moment increasing his morphine having failed to note the word alcoholic on his chart meaning that his damaged liver routed the opiates straight to his brain his beautiful fragile brain which i had not yet finished loving my father who still had manners who was a hardwood a tough tree that was his first death

 back in those days when he told me about his adventures in sex clubs it wasnt the whys and wherefores  but technical details like going rafting down the colorado river and when he wrote  about a gay male friend whose first sexual experience was with his stepfather the friend told him  it wasnt weird but the best possible thing that could have happened    i saw then that god  who i never believed in was dwelling in my heart as a negative that the negative had been developed  into a picture of a man who stares up at the sky on a day so clear he sees through the mountains shadows  to the divinely humanseeming form that climbs it a neighbor in running shoes and sunglasses  jogging up the slope with his dog tongue panting and slavering an acute look of happiness in its eyes  that could turn at any moment into exhaustion or pain as in a maze of cubicles called asshole alley little pyramids  of canvas called lust of the pharaohs different pricing for what you want depending on the equipment  the air thick with a sour acidic headfogging reek of come    and my pal the poet who believed  in infernal chemistry in the spirit as a kind of spooky action at a distance he communed  with this god this eternally dying father of all matter who made out of our bodies his own maze of cubicles  where he hides himself awayhis sanctuary asshole alley where gods own unholy loves  bubble all around him like a cauldron in his ears and my poet pal heard the bubbling he stirred  the pot he showed me the holy city the sexual new jerusalem that came prepared as a bride adorned for her husband     that was how it was in those days back when my friend hadnt yet met the coroner who wrote down  his cause of death as polysubstance abuse that brought on his heart attack while fucking     and regardless if i believed whenever we were together god shone clearer  those were the days when every morning god woke up in a blur of ecstasy and went to bed every night  in divine rage whoever loved him he loved whoever hated him  he hated back for who can doubt the vitality of hate or the volatility of love

 my death was arranged by special plans in heaven and only occasioned comment by ten persons in adams massachusetts the best thing ever said about me was that i was deft at specifying trump i was killed by my father and married to my mother but born too early to know what happened to me and as i was an only child i erected selfishness into a personal religion sat thinking forty years saying nothing i observed all i loved to drink gin would not have thought to go farther into arcane episodes of the heavier drugs and being new england always remained sober however i confess now i was always afraid of women i don’t know why it was just the way it was i could never get very close to any woman knowledge and intelligence allowed me the grand rationalization of this also i respected delicacy but would not go too far in any direction i thought i was a good man i was  i did not obstruct the state nor religion but i saw through both and maintained my independence i kept my counsels among the learned my learning was more private and precious than worldly the world had no sense of the devious so my private vicissitudes were mine alone  i say all this with a special sort of grace for i avoided many of the pitfalls of fallen man and while i did not have heroic size the creative grandeur or mastership of the mind i earned my bread by cynicism alone and blow you all a kiss from the tomb

 disturbed at 2 am i hear a claw scratching the window tapping at the pane and then i realise a broken branch and yet i can’t turn back to sleep again  slowly not to wake you i get up thinking of food perhaps a quiet read a cockroach runs across the kitchen floor its lacquered shell as quick and dry as seed  outside the chalice lily lifts its cup in adoration to the mirrored moon full of purpose as it trembles there collecting drops of moisture on its spoon  noises of the night it’s all alive birds shifting in the steady trees slugs and snails eating fallen flowers a moth freighted with fragilities  nocturnal life the other side of things proceeding whether we observe or not like rows and rows of brown coastal ants transporting food from here to another spot

 long after ovid’s story of philomela has gone out of fashion and after the testimonials of hafiz and keats have been smothered in comment and droned dead in schools and after eliot has gone home from the sacred heart and ransom has spat and consigned to human youth what he reduced to fairy numbers after the name has become slightly embarrassing and dried skins have yielded their details and tapes have been slowed and analyzed and there is nothing at all for me to say one nightingale is singing nearby in the oaks where i can see nothing but darkness and can only listen and ride out on the long note’s invisible beam that wells up and bursts from its unknown star on on on never returning never the same never caught while through the small leaves of may the starlight glitters from its own journeys once in the ancestry of this song my mother visited here lightning struck the locomotive in the mountains it had never happened before and there were so many things to tell that she had just seen and would never have imagined now a field away i hear another voice beginning and on the slope there is a third not echoing but varying after the lives after the goodbyes after the faces and the light after the recognitions and the touching and tears those voices go on rising if i knew i would hear in the last dark that singing i know how i would listen

 chico whines no reason why just now walked dinner gobbled head and ears well scratched and yet he whines looking up at me as if confused at my just sitting here typing away while darkness is stalking the back yard how can i be so blind he wants to know how sad how tragic how i won’t listen before it is too late his whines are refugees from a brain where time and loss have small dominion but where the tyranny of now is absolute i get up and throw open the kitchen door and he disappears down the cement steps barking deeper and darker than i remember i follow to find him perfectly still in the empty yard the two of us in the twilight standing guard

 after heinrich i f biber i  what’s unseen may not exist or so those secret powers insist that prowl past nightfall enabled by the brain’s blacklist to fester out of sight  so we streak from bad to worse through an expanding universe and see no evil on my rounds like a night nurse or sentry on qui vive  i make through murkier hours my way where the sun patrolled all day toward stoneblind midnight to poke this flickering flashlamp’s ray at what’s hushed up and hidden  lacking all leave or protocol things one by one hear my footfall blank out their faces dodge between trees find cracks in walls or lock down offices  still though scuttling forces flee just as far stars recede from me to outmost boundaries i stalk through ruins and debris graveyard and underground  led by their helmetlantern’s light miners inch through anthracite i’m the unblinking mole that sniffs out what gets lost or might slip down the world’s black hole  ii  ending his rounds the watchman somewhat tipsy returns  what’s obscenejust our obsessed incessant itch and interest in things found frightful in bestial tortures rape incest in ripe forbidden fruit  dangling lush just out of reach dim cellars nailed up under each towering success the loser’s envy that will teach a fierce vindictiveness  the victors’ high court that insures pardon for winners and procures little that’s needed but all we lust for what endures exponential greed  and trash containers overflowing with shredded memos records showing what who when why ’til there’s no sure way of knowing what’s clear to every eye  the heart’s delight in hatred runny as the gold drip from combs of honey the rectal intercourse of power politics and money that slimes both goal and source  what’s obscuredwhat’s abscessed after inspection i’d suggest it’s time we got our head rewired i plan to just get pissed shitfaced and braindead

 too sound of mind the paper table cloth was tastefully bleak the misty morning light shone on his cheek and made him look alone and masculine  he talked of seneca and bad translations of modern critics lightweight observations a bread crumb rested sweetly on his chin  behind him through the glass the oceans heave uncurled against the sand beside his sleeve as eros aimed his toxic javelin  i ducked out of the way to no avail it glanced my flesh injecting quite a cocktail that blurred my sight and caused my head to spin  never mind the coffee we were drinking whatever i said was not what i was thinking i wanted to become his mandolin  and lie across his lap a dainty lute and sing to him and feed him ripened fruit while light upon the sea turned opaline  instead this conversation about art and formal educationgod hes smart such rationality should be a sin  the hour was up he had to run of course a handshake and a peck of shy remorse outside the sea was gray and dull as tin it ruled the shore with tedious discipline

 no i wasn’t meant to love and be loved if i’d lived longer i would have waited longer  knowing you are faithless keeps me alive and hungry knowing you faithful would kill me with joy  delicate are you and your vows are delicate too so easily do they break  you are a laconic marksman you leave me not dead but perpetually dying  i want my friends to heal me succor me instead i get analysis  conflagrations that would make stones drip blood are campfires compared to my anguish  twoheaded inescapable anguish love’s anguish or the anguish of time  another dark severing incommunicable night death would be fine if i only died once  i would have liked a solitary death not this lavish funeral this grave anyone can visit  you are mystical ghalib and also you speak beautifully are you a saint or just drunk as usual

 i am a woman no more and no less i live my life as it is thread by thread and i spin my wool to wear not to complete homer’s story or his sun and i see what i see as it is in its shape though i stare every once in a while in its shade to sense the pulse of defeat and i write tomorrow on yesterday’s sheets there’s no sound other than echo i love the necessary vagueness in what a night traveler says to the absence of birds over the slopes of speech and above the roofs of villages i am a woman no more and no less  the almond blossom sends me flying in march from my balcony in longing for what the faraway says “touch me and i’ll bring my horses to the water springs” i cry for no clear reason and i love you as you are not as a strut nor in vain and from my shoulders a morning rises onto you and falls into you when i embrace you a night but i am neither one nor the other no i am not a sun or a moon i am a woman no more and no less  so be the qyss of longing if you wish as for me i like to be loved as i am not as a color photo in the paper or as an idea composed in a poem amid the stags … i hear laila’s faraway scream from the bedroom do not leave me a prisoner of rhyme in the tribal nights do not leave me to them as news … i am a woman no more and no less  i am who i am as you are who you are you live in me and i live in you to and for you i love the necessary clarity of our mutual puzzle i am yours when i overflow the night but i am not a land or a journey i am a woman no more and no less  and i tire from the moon’s feminine cycle and my guitar falls ill string by string i am a woman no more and no less

 i tonight i look thunderstruck at the gold head of my grandchild almost asleep he buries his feet between my thighs his little straw eyes close in the near dark i smell the warmth of his raw slightly foul breath the new death waiting to rot inside him our breaths equalize our heartbeats every muscle of the chest uncoils the arm bones loosen in the nest of nerves i think of the peace of walking through the house pointing to the name of this the name of that an educator of a new man  mother grandmother wise snakewoman who will show the way spiderwoman whose black tentacles hold him precious or will tear off his head her teeth over the little husband the small fist clotted in trust at her breast  this morning looking at the face of his father i remembered how an infant his face was too dark nose too broad mouth too wide i did not look in that mirror and see the face that could save me from my own darkness did he looking in my eye see what i turned from my own dark grandmother bending over gladioli in the field her shaking black hand defenseless at the shining cock of flower  i wanted that face to die to be reborn in the face of a white child  i wanted the soul to stay the same for i loved to death to damnation and goddeath the soul that broke out of me i crowed my son my beautiful but when i peeked in the basket i saw the face of a black man  did i bend over his nose and straighten it with my fingers like a vine growing the wrong way did he feel my hand in malice  generations we prayed and fucked for this light child the shining god of the second coming we bow down in shame and carry the children of the past in our wallets begging forgiveness  ii a picture in a book a lynching the bland faces of men who watch a christ go up in flames smiling as if he were a hooked fish a felled antelope some wild thing tied to boards and burned his charring body gives off lighta halo burns out of him his face scorched featureless the hair matted to the scalp like feathers one man stands with his hand on his hip another with his arm slung over the shoulder of a friend as if this moment were large enough to hold affection  iii how can we wake from a dream we are born into that shines around us the terrible bright air  having awakened having seen our own bloody hands how can we ask forgiveness bring before our children the real monster of their nightmares  the worst is true everything you did not want to know

 for kenward elmslie  up from the valley now and then a chain saw rising to a shriek subsiding to a buzz “someone” is “cutting in his wood lot” another day shows they are not someone is two men clearing shoulders of a narrow highcrowned road stacked poles were lately sapling the leaves on the slash gone limp unstarched unsized one man with one fierce eye and where the other should be an illknit cicatrix men who don’t make much aren’t much for spending what they do on glass eyes toothstraightening devices “a mouth like the back of a switchboard” nose jobs dewenning operations a country look prevails and a vestigial fear of the evil eye lurks “   my skin creeps   ” out of adamant coop men in “overhauls” step into evening rising in longshadowed bluish haze to gold and pink by sodom lake was it that any bible name was an ok name and boys stare unabashed and unaggressive not what the man on the bus fled from his one day job talking excitedly about “teenage puerto rican tailbait” and “you can have new york” some present you’d rather have wouldn’t you an apple tree that climbed up into keels over sad and too bad the best apples on apple hill still it can be propped or budded on new stock or just that it once was there driving past driving down driving over along the winooski through the home of granite city real ice cream the monument capitol buildings of rusticated granite marred to our eyes by etched polished granite remodeled downstairs may be found by a future happily heterodox “there’s a touch of autumn there’s another touch of autumn” and the dark tranquility of hemlocks encroaching on untilled fields “you can’t make a living plowing stones” subsistence farming is well out of style “you can’t call it living without the margin” coveted obsolescence a margin like that on this page a paper luxury “collectors” the lady in the antique shop said “are snapping up silver” “since we’re off the silver standard” “why maybe so” perhaps six 1827 salem coinsilver spoons for 18 or what about “have you the pearl of orr’s island” “that’s a book i’d want to read myself i’m from here but live in florida winters are too hard 40 below you don’t feel it though like zero in boston i’ll take st johnsbury any day over boston” over st johnsbury the clouds shift in curds and a street goes steeply down into frenchtown by the railroad station into which anachronistically comes a real train yesterday’s torment of dustexhaling plush on the backs of bare knees today’s nostalgia but not much curls cut out of wood brick of a certain cut and color a

in undergrowth leads up to by walls of flat clearedfield stones so many and so long a time to take so much labor so long ago and so soon to be going back a host to hardhack and blueberry baby steps first fallings from a sky in which the wind is moving furniture the upholstery of summer coming all unstitched the air full of flying kapok and resolutions “remember to fetch the ax whack back pine intrusions” from the road turning down to a lower field and across the roughest one the county keeps a woman and a boy come up on heavy horses “morning had frost last night at adamant might have a killing frost tonight” quick and clear as the water where cress grows the cold breaks on the hills to the soft crash of a waterfall beyond a beaver pond and slides on flinging imaginary fragments of cat’s ice from its edges to flash a bright reality in the night sky and it  the coldstands a rising pool about sloven’s farmhouse and he dreams of dynamite a bog sucks at his foundations somewhere a deer breaks branches the trees say wesson mazola replies a frog it doesn’t happen though the cold that is not that night it happens all right not then when the white baneberry leans secretively where a road forks met with surprise “why here it is the most beautiful thing” the spirit of gelett burgess sets mother nature gabbing “that’s my actea pachypoda dear we call it doll’seyes” got up as smart as ever in muck and dank she belches “’scuse just a touch of gas” swamp maple flames and ambles over and plunks down on a dead rubber tire to contemplate smashed glass and a rusty tin and “some of my choicer bits that i call doctor’s dentures these are little smellies” not the sort you look to meet so near golddomed out of scale montpelier a largewindowed kind of empty public bigness so little to show so much to take pride in rather more than on the way to stowe a pyrocrafted maple board in a gyptoteria if more men were self starters fewer wives would have to crank welcome to the chair lift and cement chalet days of unambiguous morning when dawn peels back like a petal to disclose blue depths deep beyond all comprehending and tall field growth bends with a crushing weight of water cut into sacshaped portions each less than a carat and which streak an early walker’s trouser legs “you’re soaked” crossing on a door the spill to where nodding ladies’ tresses pallidly braid their fragrance and the woods emit their hum days when the pond holds on its steel one cloud in which thin drowned trees stand spare shapes of winter when summer is just loosening to fall and bits of ribbon from an electric typewriter patch a screen croquet days scissorandpaste nights after dinner on the better sort of ham and coffee strong enough to float a goose egg are those geese that v flying so early can it be so late in the green state needles leaves fronds blades lichens and moss create can it be so soon before the long white refrozen in frost on frost on all twigs again will flash cross

 six oclock the kitchen bulbs which blister your dark your housewives starting to nose out each others day the claustrophobia of your back gardens varicose with shrubs make an ugly sister of you suburbia  how long ago did the glass in your windows subtly silver into mirrors which again and again show the same woman shriek at a child which multiply a dish a brush ash the gape of a fish  in the kitchen the gape of a child in the cot you swelled so that when you tried the silver slipper on your foot it pinched your instep and the common hurt which touched you made you human  no creature of the streets will feel the touch of a wand turning the wet sinews of fruit suddenly to a coach while this rat without leather reins or a whip or britches continues sliming your drains  no magic here yet you encroach until the shy countryside fooled by your plainness falls then rises from your bed changed schooled forever by your skill your compromises  midnight and your metamorphosis is now complete although the mind which spinstered you might still miss your mystery now might still fail to see your power defined by this detail  by this creature drowsing now in every house the same lion who tore stripes once off zebras who now sleeps small beside the coals and may on a red letter day catch a mouse

 i have not disappeared the boulevard is full of my steps the sky is full of my thinking an archbishop prays for my soul even though we met only once and even then he was busy waving at a congregation the ticking clocks in vermont sway  back and forth as though sweeping up my eyes and my tattoos and my metaphors and what comes up are the great paragraphs of dust which also carry motes of my existence i have not disappeared my wife quivers inside a kiss my pulse was given to her many times  in many countries the chunks of bread we dip in olive oil is communion with our ancestors who also have not disappeared their delicate songs i wear on my eyelids their smiles have given me freedom which is a crater i keep falling in when i bite into the two halves of an orange whose crosssection resembles my lungs  a delta of juices burst down my chin and like magic makes me appear to those who think ive disappeared its too bad war makes people disappear like chess pieces and that prisons turn prisoners into movie endings when i fade into the mountains on a forest trail i still have not disappeared even though its green façade turns my arms and legs into branches of oak it is then i belong to a southerly wind which by now you have mistaken as me nodding back and forth like a hasid in prayer or a mother who has just lost her son to gunfire in detroit i have not disappeared  in my children i see my bulging face pressing further into the mysteries  in a library in tucson on a plane above buenos aires on a field where nearby burns a controlled fire i am held by a professor a general and a photographer one burns a finely wrapped cigar then sniffs the scented pages of my books scouring for the bitter smell of control i hold him in my mind like a chalice i have not disappeared i swish the amber hue of lager on my tongue and ponder the drilling rigs in the gulf of alaska and all the oilpainted plovers  when we talk about limits we disappear in jasper tx you can disappear on a strip of gravel  i am a life in sacred language termites toil over a grave and my mind is a ravine of yesterdays at a glance from across the room i wear september on my face which is eternal and does not disappear even if you close your eyes once and for all simultaneously like two coffins

 when the first mechanical picker had stripped the field it left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness that my mother could not console herself to the waste and insisted on having it picked over with human hands  though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets and the hands had long since gone into the factories no matter how often my father pointed this out she worried it the way i’ve worried the extra words  in poems that i conceived with the approximate notion that each stanza should have the same number of lines and each line the same number of syllables and disregarded it telling myself a ripple  or botch on the surface like the stutter of a speaker is all i have to affirm the deep fluency below the hebrews distrusted greek poetry which embodied harmony and symmetry and therefore revision  not for aesthetic reasons but because they believed that to change the first words which rose unsmelted from the trance amounted to sacrilege against god in countries where because of the gross abundance  of labor it’s unlawful to import harvesting machines i see the women in the fields and think of how when my mother used to pick you could tell her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage  that tumbled from her sack so pristinely white and devoid of burrs it seemed to have already passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin dr williams said of eliot that his poems were so  cautiously wrought that they seemed to come to us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow what my father loved about my mother was not just the beauty of her body and face but the practice  of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands as they made the house that abides in us still as worry and bother but also the perfect freedom beyond as cleanliness is next to godliness but is not god

 oh that those lips had language life has passd with me but roughly since i heard thee last those lips are thinethy own sweet smiles i see the same that oft in childhood solaced me voice only fails else how distinct they say grieve not my child chase all thy fears away the meek intelligence of those dear eyes blest be the art that can immortalize the art that baffles times tyrannic claim to quench it here shines on me still the same  faithful remembrancer of one so dear oh welcome guest though unexpected here who biddst me honour with an artless song affectionate a mother lost so long i will obey not willingly alone but gladly as the precept were her own and while that face renews my filial grief fancy shall weave a charm for my relief shall steep me in elysian reverie a momentary dream that thou art she  my mother when i learnd that thou wast dead say wast thou conscious of the tears i shed hoverd thy spirit oer thy sorrowing son wretch even then lifes journey just begun perhaps thou gavst me though unseen a kiss perhaps a tear if souls can weep in bliss ah that maternal smile it answersyes i heard the bell tolld on thy burial day i saw the hearse that bore thee slow away and turning from my nursry window drew a long long sigh and wept a last adieu but was it suchit waswhere thou art gone adieus and farewells are a sound unknown may i but meet thee on that peaceful shore the parting sound shall pass my lips no more thy maidens grievd themselves at my concern oft gave me promise of a quick return what ardently i wishd i long believd and disappointed still was still deceivd by disappointment every day beguild dupe of tomorrow even from a child thus many a sad tomorrow came and went till all my stock of infant sorrow spent i learnd at last submission to my lot but though i less deplord thee neer forgot  where once we dwelt our name is heard no more children not thine have trod my nursry floor and where the gardner robin day by day drew me to school along the public way delighted with my bauble coach and wrapt in scarlet mantle warm and velvet capt tis now become a history little known that once we calld the pastral house our own shortlivd possession but the record fair that memry keeps of all thy kindness there still outlives many a storm that has effacd a thousand other themes less deeply tracd thy nightly visits to my chamber made that thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid thy morning bounties ere i left my home the biscuit or confectionary plum the fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowd by thy own hand till fresh they shone and glowd all this and more endearing still than all thy constant flow of love that knew no fall neer roughend by those cataracts and brakes that humour interposd too often makes all this still legible in memrys page and still to be so to my latest age adds joy to duty makes me glad to pay such honours to thee as my numbers may perhaps a frail memorial but sincere not scornd in heavn though little noticd here  could time his flight reversd restore the hours when playing with thy vestures tissued flowrs the violet the pink and jessamine i prickd them into paper with a pin and thou wast happier than myself the while wouldst softly speak and stroke my head and smile could those few pleasant hours again appear might one wish bring them would i wish them here i would not trust my heartthe dear delight seems so to be desird perhaps i might but nowhat here we call our life is such so little to be lovd and thou so much that i should ill requite thee to constrain thy unbound spirit into bonds again  thou as a gallant bark from albions coast the storms all weatherd and the ocean crossd shoots into port at some wellhavend isle where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile there sits quiescent on the floods that show her beauteous form reflected clear below while airs impregnated with incense play around her fanning light her streamers gay so thou with sails how swift hast reachd the shore where tempests never beat nor billows roar and thy lovd consort on the dangrous tide of life long since has anchord at thy side but me scarce hoping to attain that rest always from port withheld always distressd me howling winds drive devious tempest tossd sails ript seams opning wide and compass lost and day by day some currents thwarting force sets me more distant from a prosprous course but oh the thought that thou art safe and he that thought is joy arrive what may to me my boast is not that i deduce my birth from loins enthrond and rulers of the earth but higher far my proud pretensions rise the son of parents passd into the skies and now farewelltime unrevokd has run his wonted course yet what i wishd is done by contemplations help not sought in vain i seem t have livd my childhood oer again to have renewd the joys that once were mine without the sin of violating thine and while the wings of fancy still are free and i can view this mimic shew of thee time has but half succeeded in his theft thyself removd thy power to sooth me left

 of  that string of memories about our lost friendship i remember being invited places as a pair like a comedy team and after one party our selfparody of our own stammering speechlessness when introduced to henrik the swedish god auto mechanic our twin garish purpleflowered swimsuits from kmart outlining around texas our sameness and differences our dual waitressing shifts across town and the long phone calls that followed with their emphatic reiteration of every stingy sixtop ordering candyflavored alcoholic drinks the afterwork visit where we brayed stomped then blinked stupidly while the needle hit the lp’s end at the empty fifth of gin left on the coffee table prompting a dimuh oh your imitation of your mother’s habitual and bytheway inexplicable confession about you to shoe salesmen she has a funny foot the apartments the olivettis the boyfriends all the thoughts exchanged unedited like an experiment of the big walkin consciousness which we might have assumed the verbal equivalent of sex for friends and whatever closeness meant we wanted as much as we could have it was our postgraduate work in the humanities even now i can’t resist striking up a conversation while standing on line any line or introducing myself enthusiastically to whomever i am introduced but the truth is i am not looking for new friends at this point i am trying to locate the lost ones the ones who left through the hole of an argument decades ago a time more panicked and carefree than any other except maybe the early years of motherhood which i missed sharing with you on playground benches but surely i will see you on the bus someday and your greeting will package our jokes advice tears book talk our years of reliance and so i will expect you will tell me how much i have misunderstood and wrongly assumed in these descriptions because i never expect those people who have mattered to remain completely gone even through death or rebuke and of course i have to remember what parted us that i found faults with your other friends that i spoke as critically and crassly about them as i did about my own person and to this day i have to be careful of that trait my junkyard dog of expression safe only with me on a toolong leash here again telling you everything with no reason but for memory’s insistence that i string an apology from what i see

 in vain to me the smiling mornings shine and reddening phœbus lifts his golden fire the birds in vain their amorous descant join or cheerful fields resume their green attire these ears alas for other notes repine a different object do these eyes require my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine and in my breast the imperfect joys expire yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer and newborn pleasure brings to happier men the fields to all their wonted tribute bear to warm their little loves the birds complain i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear and weep the more because i weep in vain

 there was dai puw he was no good they put him in the fields to dock swedes and took the knife from him when he came home at late evening with a grin like the slash of a knife on his face  there was llew puw and he was no good every evening after the ploughing with the big tractor he would sit in his chair and stare into the tangled fire garden opening his slow lips like a snail  there was huw puw too what shall i say i have heard him whistling in the hedges on and on as though winter would never again leave those fields and all the trees were deformed  and lastly there was the girl beauty under some spell of the beast her pale face was the lantern by which they read in life’s dark book the shrill sentence god is love

 i don’t love you as if you were a rose of salt topaz or arrow of carnations that propagate fire i love you as one loves certain obscure things secretly between the shadow and the soul  i love you as the plant that doesn’t bloom but carries the light of those flowers hidden within itself and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose from the earth lives dimly in my body  i love you without knowing how or when or from where i love you directly without problems or pride i love you like this because i don’t know any other way to love except in this form in which i am not nor are you so close that your hand upon my chest is mine so close that your eyes close with my dreams

 at the end of my stepfather’s life when his anger was gone and the saplings of his failed nursery had grown into trees my newly feminist mother had him in the kitchen to pay for all those years he only did the carving “you know where that is” she would say as he looked for a knife to cut the cheese and a tray to serve it with his apron wide as a dress above his workboots confused as a girl he is the one i think of now lifting the tray for my family the guests until at last he comes to me and i no less confused look down from his hurt eyes as if there were nothing between us except an arrangement of cheese and not this bafflement these almost tender hands that once swung hammers and drove machines and insisted that i learn to be a man

 local his discourse not yet exemplary nowadays he is old the translator so old he is practically transparent  good things and otherwise evils done come home to him too close to the bone and so little transformed him so transparent they float in and out of his window  killing fields and the pumpkin patch the combat boot putrid in a cherry tree stroke on stroke the mortal buildup all the constraint all the letting go  so insistent in his attentions that he needs a breathing block for lack of a monitor he might levitate the testy old bird at his wondow he needs an animal a sure thing one to imagine at last speechless as bedrock a rough reminder of that  a dog might be vigilant enough intact all heart a yellow desert dog avoirdupoids a leopard markings regular talons to swat any hurt away knowing hunger not the greed sufficient  unto itself svelte clean of limb free through selfdiscipline yes yes through selfdiscipline free  and fierce yet doing no violence the wild by right he will restore to a holy place in time  for want of that sort of a beast he might make do with a frog

 while spoonfeeding him with one hand she holds his hand with her other hand or rather lets it rest on top of his which is permanently clenched shut when he turns his head away she reaches around and puts in the spoonful blind he will not accept the next morsel until he has completely chewed this one his bright squint tells her he finds the shrimp she has just put in delicious next to the voice and touch of those we love food may be our last pleasure on earth a man on death row takes his tbone in small bites and swishes each sip of the jug wine around in his mouth tomorrow will be too late for them to jolt this supper out of him she strokes his head very slowly as if to cheer up each separate discomfited hair sticking up from its root in his stricken brain standing behind him she presses her cheek to his kisses his jowl and his eyes seem to stop seeing and do nothing but emit light could heaven be a time after we are dead of remembering the knowledge flesh had from flesh the flesh of his face is hard perhaps from years spent facing down others until they fell back and harder from years of being himself faced down and falling back in his turn and harder still from all the while frowning and beaming and worrying and shouting and probably letting go in rages his face softens into a kind of quizzical wince as if one of the other animals were working at getting the knack of the human smile when picking up a cookie he uses both thumbtips to grip it and push it against an index finger to secure it so that he can lift it she takes him then to the bathroom where she lowers his pants and removes the wet diaper and holds the spout of the bottle to his old penis until he pisses all he can then puts on the fresh diaper and pulls up his pants when they come out she is facing him walking backwards in front of him and holding his hands pulling him when he stops reminding him to step when he forgets and starts to pitch forward she is leading her old father into the future as far as they can go and she is walking him back into her childhood where she stood in bare feet on the toes of his shoes and they foxtrotted on this same rug i watch them closely she could be teaching him the last steps that one day she may teach me at this moment he glints and shines as if it will be only a small dislocation for him to pass from this paradise into the next

 from the cliffs edge kicking her feet in panic and despair as the circle of light contracts and blackness takes the screen and that is how we leave her hangingthough we know she will be rescued only to descend into fresh harm the story flowing on disaster and reprievesystole diastolesplit rhythm of a heart that hungers  only to go on so why is this like my mother caged in a railed bed each breath a fresh installment in a tortured tale of capture and release nine days she dangled stubborn over the abyss the soft clay crumbling beneath her fingertips until she dropped with a little bird cry of surprise into the swift river below  here metaphor collapses for there was no love to rescue her no small boat waiting with a net to fish her out although the water carried her and it was april when we buried her among the weeping cherries and the waving flags and in the final fade a heron breasted the far junipers to gain the tremulous air and swim away

 on my cutting board i discovered them the tiniest of ants roaming dots of lead at first they were too few to classify hiding under crumbs these scavengers of leftovers admiring their labor i immediately granted them citizenship these tailgaters of a kitchens routines  in miami i had no stove working far from my home my wife was a midnight call to san bernardino while searching for crumbs especially for the taste of apricot jelly they fell into a line across my cutting board i saw it again saw the line my sixthgrade teacher drew on the board pointing to each end  while he planted himself on his desk he leaned his face toward us telling us in a low voice  you dont see it yet youre too young still but that line in front of you continues infinitely on either side and if there is the slightest slope in that line either way it will slowly begin to sag then curve and veer and eventually one end will find the other  and lines lines are never perfect they are like us never completely straight so just imagine the searching that goes on all around us every day and to happen on that union is really to witness the most earthly of forms youll ever get to know if youre lucky youll see that even luckier if youre part of that union

 we’re talking about when we met and you say  it was easier to fall for me thinking i’ll remember  this pause it was likely i’d be dead by now  talking falling thinking waiting    have i  undone what you’ve tried to do you say no  you say the surprise of still being is something  being built the machine of our living this saltwork of luck  stylish safe comfortable and unintended  meanwhile i haven’t had the opportunity to tell you but  our lovely little dog has just killed a possum  maybe it’s unfair a possum entering the argument here  but i lay it down before us because an ugly  dying  possum played dead and didn’t run  its dubious cunning was brought to an end outside our door  by our brutal beautiful and very pleased little dog  so how do i say that this is not about death or sadness  or even whether you really first loved me  waiting thinking i’d be dying young  it’s just that standing there a few minutes ago  holding a dead possum by its repellent bony tail  i was struck by how eerily pleased i was to be a spectator  to teeth spit agony and claw feeling full of purpose  thinking how different in our adversaries we are from possums  we try love the fist of words their opening hand  and whether we play dead or alive our pain the slow  circulation of happiness our salt and work the stubborn questions  we endlessly give names to haunt us with choice

 once more the storm is howling and half hid under this cradlehood and coverlid my child sleeps on there is no obstacle but gregorys wood and one bare hill whereby the haystack and rooflevelling wind bred on the atlantic can be stayed and for an hour i have walked and prayed because of the great gloom that is in my mind  i have walked and prayed for this young child an hour and heard the seawind scream upon the tower and under the arches of the bridge and scream in the elms above the flooded stream imagining in excited reverie that the future years had come dancing to a frenzied drum out of the murderous innocence of the sea  may she be granted beauty and yet not beauty to make a strangers eye distraught or hers before a lookingglass for such being made beautiful overmuch consider beauty a sufficient end lose natural kindness and maybe the heartrevealing intimacy that chooses right and never find a friend  helen being chosen found life flat and dull and later had much trouble from a fool while that great queen that rose out of the spray being fatherless could have her way yet chose a bandyleggèd smith for man its certain that fine women eat a crazy salad with their meat whereby the horn of plenty is undone  in courtesy id have her chiefly learned hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned by those that are not entirely beautiful yet many that have played the fool for beautys very self has charm made wise and many a poor man that has roved loved and thought himself beloved from a glad kindness cannot take his eyes  may she become a flourishing hidden tree that all her thoughts may like the linnet be and have no business but dispensing round their magnanimities of sound nor but in merriment begin a chase nor but in merriment a quarrel oh may she live like some green laurel rooted in one dear perpetual place  my mind because the minds that i have loved the sort of beauty that i have approved prosper but little has dried up of late yet knows that to be choked with hate may well be of all evil chances chief if theres no hatred in a mind assault and battery of the wind can never tear the linnet from the leaf  an intellectual hatred is the worst so let her think opinions are accursed have i not seen the loveliest woman born out of the mouth of plentys horn because of her opinionated mind barter that horn and every good by quiet natures understood for an old bellows full of angry wind  considering that all hatred driven hence the soul recovers radical innocence and learns at last that it is selfdelighting selfappeasing selfaffrighting and that its own sweet will is heavens will she can though every face should scowl and every windy quarter howl or every bellows burst be happy still  and may her bridegroom bring her to a house where alls accustomed ceremonious for arrogance and hatred are the wares peddled in the thoroughfares how but in custom and in ceremony are innocence and beauty born ceremonys a name for the rich horn and custom for the spreading laurel tree

 no one can draw fast enough to capture the cut iris before its form falls from its former self but when we passed a patch in the ditch she told me to stop and she stepped down opening her clasp knife she spared one iris with an impressionistic cocoon on its stem and cut the flower beside it once home she rendered in a careful hurry she drew into the night as the iris died i woke grafted to her in a vague translucent hammock of dread

 the absence was there before the meeting the radical of presence    and absence does not return with death’s chance encounter as in the old duality life or death wherein the transcendence of the one translates the other into an everness we do not meet in heaven that outward of hell and death’s beauty    it is a bright and terrible disk where jack is where charles is where james is where berg is  is here in the continuous carmen o some thingsdibreathe intoaspirateand lead away deducite for the soul is a thing among many berkeley shimmers and shakes in my mind    most lost    the absence preceded the place and the friendships    lady rosario among us    of spanish and greek rushes from the hedges around the gas station swirled with lawrence’s medlars and sorbapples what is it reminds us of white gods fleshfragrant as if with sweat    the delicious rottenness

 to tell you the truth i’d have thought it had gone out of use long ago there is something so 19thcentury about it  with its absurd reverse puritanism  can withdrawal from reality or interpersonal commitment be gauged by uneasiness at being summoned to a small closed room to discuss ambiguously sexual material with a total stranger  alone in the presence of the grave examiner it soon becomes clear that short of strangling yourself you are going to have to find a way of suppressing the snickers of an eightyearold sex fiend and feign cu riosity about the process to mask your indignation at being placed in this situation  sure you see lots of pretty butterflies with the faces of ancient egypt ian queens and so forthyou see other things too  flying stingray vaginas all over the place along with a few of their male counterparts transparently camouflaged as who knows what pil lars and swords out of the old brain’s unconscious  you keep finding yourself thinking “god damn it don’t tell me that isn’t a pussy”  but after long silence come out with “oh this must be christ trying to prevent a large crowd from stoning a woman to death”  the thing to do is keep a straight face which is hard after all you’re supposed to be crazy  and are probably proving it  maybe a nudge and a chuckle or two wouldn’t hurt your case yes  it’s some little card game you’ve gotten yourself into this time when your only chance is to lose fold  and they have got you by the balls  just like the ones you neglected to identify

 natchez afternoon burns everything off franklin street even the birds even the flies  or icedtea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone into a doze all indoors in a cool  they said would never come eighty years ago when this was still the center of business  and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs ice in a highball and let each house  close its lids a while theyve kept their quiet so im alone before the windows  the radiant panes each with its scrim of clay the finish the river gives everything  so nothing not even glass is clear its almost painful this saturation  this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags bright and strange as a magazine photo  youd find in an attic or an antique store hard to believe the color was ever real  the teacups the painted china and jeweled eggs even the bottles medicine vials  and flasks each with its ounce of dirt even the smell of the prolific earth  the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs and oak armoires and mantles that survive  their tall white homes like the plantation house where later ill witness again  the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt that still feels like a dream where ill walk  out ofor is it intomyself the maitreds small solicitous voice  proffering another julepcottonleaf hand silver cupthough even he must be  a reenactment or a revenant a hanger for the clothes of memory  i will take it i would a handful of refuge in unthinking weather will take  the same lethargic joy in a breeze any chill in the throat any kind of shade  so i enter the dim of one old cotton house its airconditioned maze of handtools  and quilts corn cribs and cotton gins and of course the owners smile porcelain bright almost  blinding blooming in welcome and howyoudo and whatbringsyou we talk amid rows  of cookstoves stewpots and castiron skillets about the wedding ive come to see  on the famed estate the time the town exploded the rhythm clubs inferno and then  she ventures she knows the accent knows im from alabama and soon shes eloquent  on our lakes and rivers where the mister takes her every chance they get shes seen it all  so she asks where im from and when i say she starts to glow gushing over mountains  all the way to gatlinburg shes walked each one even skied the states one slope which conjures  not the southern snow that required almost everything around us but snow cold snow a thought  that cools me further so my sweat is nearly dry when the smile tightens across her teeth  and she leans in to say ijust love it you knowthere are no darkies there  then afternoon is a conspiracy of color an echo the heat or the history  in our voices draws us into someone elses version of ourselves  and the inevitable painful quiet in which an answer must arrive  what can you say and how long do you have to wait before you can leave before you can walk  out of yourself and down the cottontrading streets into the smother of trees  on some more recent lane how long do you have to wait before you can leave and not be followed  and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds drown in bass and drum and anger  before you can cross back into the proper century the smell of the river stays with you  maybe even grows as you move so you dont know where youre going and the key in your hand  could open a car door or a plantation room or nothing at all some door thats vanished  in the air junes shimmer from the asphalt and the roofs of every house so you walk  toward that moment when the sun starts burning and the magnolias thick perfume washes  all around and you find yourself on a corner all linen and sweat again the only one  whod walk in a heat like this you have no idea where you are so you cock your head  as if you might hear your way through the afternoon and when you raise your head you see  across the street two men hunched in shadow on a barbershops stoop ties  dangling like smoke in the solid air theyve seen you and now their brows sharpen  as if they know too youre not from here and in the space between you anything  could pass the ghosts of farragut or grant or a hot white caddy rattling new orleans bounce  youre waiting to see it seems like years or centuries then one rises ties his tie and steps back in  leaving the other who keeps your eye a moment longer then looks into the distance  through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air for something far behind you something  you dont even know how to look for something that may never arrive

 i was ill lying on my bed of old papers when you came with white rabbits in your arms and the doves scattered upwards flying to mothers and the snails sighed under their baggage of stone     now your tongue grows like celery between us because of our lovecries cabbage darkens in its nest the cauliflower thinks of her pale plump children and turns greenishwhite in a light like the ocean’s  i was sick fainting in the smell of teabags when you came with tomatoes a good poetry i am being wooed i am being conquered by a cliff of limestone that leaves chalk on my breasts

 it started about noon  on top of mount batte we were all exclaiming  someone had a cardboard and a pin and we all cried out when the sun appeared in tiny form on the notebook cover  it was hard to believe  the high school teacher we’d met called it a pinhole camera people in the renaissance loved to do that and when the moon had passed partly through  we saw on a rock underneath a fir tree dozens of crescentsmade the same way thousands  even our straw hats produced a few as we moved them over the bare granite  we shared chocolate and one man from maine told a joke  suns were everywhereat our feet

 a moth lies open and lies like an old bleached beech leaf a leanto between window frame and sill its death protects a collection of tinier deaths and other dirts beneath although the white paint is waterstained on it death is dirt and hapless  the justsevered tiger lily is drinking its glass of water i hope this hope is sere this hope is severe what you ruin ruins you too and so you hope for favor i mean i do  the underside of a ladybug wanders the window i wander the continent my undercarriage not as evident so go more perilously it seems to me but i am only me to you it seems clear i mean to disappear and am mean and project on you some ancient fear  if i were a bug i hope i wouldn’t be this giant winged thing spindly like a crane fly skinnylegged like me kissing the cold ceiling fumbling for the face of the other seeking it came in with me last night when i turned on the light  i lay awake afraid it would touch my face  it wants out i want out too

 she was a phantom of delight when first she gleamed upon my sight a lovely apparition sent to be a moments ornament her eyes as stars of twilight fair like twilights too her dusky hair but all things else about her drawn from maytime and the cheerful dawn a dancing shape an image gay to haunt to startle and waylay i saw her upon nearer view a spirit yet a woman too her household motions light and free and steps of virginliberty a countenance in which did meet sweet records promises as sweet a creature not too bright or good for human natures daily food for transient sorrows simple wiles praise blame love kisses tears and smiles and now i see with eye serene the very pulse of the machine a being breathing thoughtful breath a traveller between life and death the reason firm the temperate will endurance foresight strength and skill a perfect woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command and yet a spirit still and bright with something of angelic light

 i  the sidewalks were long where i grew up they were as veined as the backs of my grandma’s hands we knew every inch of pavement we jumped the cracks chanting rhymes that broke evil spirits played tag at sunset among the fireflies and sweet maple trees or sang wishful sonnets about boyfriends to the tune of whipping jump ropes the sidewalks wrapped around corners like dirty ribbons lacing the old houses together in tight knots maple trees bordered the allwhite cemetery sometimes we’d watch priscilla’s uncle sway down the dirt alley towards home we called her pussy called him crazy max he was feebleminded and took to fits barely making it from alley to pavement loping down the street like a drunk we paced his jagged walk against tumbling tunes taunting each pigeontoed footstep with rhyme the boys      bolder louder the girls       tagging along braids flopping like twisted hemp ending in brightly colored ribbons we turned our black faces into silence when he finally made it home watched him grope up the broken concrete stairs clutch the wooden railing lunge for the broken screen door and his medicine his tongue flopped wildly parrot noises drowning his sister’s cries as she rushed from the black pit of their house  one day he leaned away from the safe umbrella of his sister’s voice leaned into the sky hanging on the porch rail like a rag doll then fell into the cracks of the sidewalk we rarely chanted after that always passed pussy’s house in silence sometimes i’d sit in the sweet stillness of grandma’s moldy basement and draw his outline on the wet fuzzy walls the grey concrete backdropped my stick figure as it fell into nothingness   ii  bumpsy played the dirty dozens as we jackknifed the length of the block forcing grownups off the street we linked arms like soldiers our black legs scissoring in precision one’s a company two’s a crowd three on the sidewalk is not allowed last night the night before twentyfour robbers at my door police police do your duty make this boy stop feeling my booty mary mary tell me true who is the one you love tin soldiers wooden guns and sharp tongues we got comic books for the price of one in blitz attacks at old man farrow’s dirty store garages were secret places for dirty jokes our folks couldn’t afford cars when we got older we played house for real until we found terry’s baby sister’s body behind a stack of tires the melodies we’d sung still seemed to bounce off the dirty walls and stacks of comic books   iii  our houses ended at the sidewalk whitewashed steps gleaming like teeth against the blocks of grey pavement we walked three blocks just to find a vacant lot to feed mildred’s thirst for green grass fat vaughn could eat a whole sheet of newspaper in less than three minutes once i licked the damp cellar wall but the taste didn’t match the sweet smell ten years later i searched through grandma’s things before they were sold for auction i found her picture three comics and the windup victrola we had used to put on our version of cotton club musicals we traded days so we could all be stars the rest sang chorus until the victrola ran out of steam the record moaning like a sick calf i found the stack of old pillows we collapsed on giggling and tumbling against each other like puppies while the needle stuck in one groove cutting circles in the records

 on the rough diamond the handcut field below the dog lot and barn we rehearsed the strict technique of bunting i watched from the infield the mound the backstop as your left hand climbed the bat your legs and shoulders squared toward the pitcher you could drop it like a seed down either base line i admired your style but not enough to take my eyes off the bank that served as our centerfield fence  years passed three leagues of organized ball no few lives i could homer into the leftfield lot of carmichael motors and still you stressed the same technique the crouch and spring the lead arm absorbing just enough impact that whole tiresome pitch about basics never changing and i never learned what you were laying down  like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap let this be the sign i’m getting a grip on the sacrifice

 the cat has the chance to make the sunlight beautiful to stop it and turn it immediately into black fur and motion to take it as shifting branch and brown feather into the back of the brain forever  the cardinal has flown the sun in red through the oak forest to the lawn the finch has caught it in yellow and taken it among the thorns by the spider it has been bound tightly and tied in an eightstringed knot  the sun has been intercepted in its one basic state and changed to a million varieties of green stick and tassel it has been broken into pieces by glass rings by mist over the river its heat has been given the board fence for body the desert rock for fact on winter hills it has been laid down in white like a martyr  this afternoon we could spread gold scarves clear across the field and say in truth sun you are silk  imagine the sun totally isolated its brightness shot in continuous streaks straight out into the black never arrested never once being made light  someone should take note of how the earth has saved the sun from oblivion

 there was once a little animal no bigger than a fox and on five toes he scampered over tertiary rocks they called him eohippus and they called him very small and they thought him of no value  when they thought of him at all for the lumpish old dinoceras and coryphodon so slow were the heavy aristocracy in days of long ago  said the little eohippus “i am going to be a horse and on my middle fingernails to run my earthly course i’m going to have a flowing tail i’m going to have a mane i’m going to stand fourteen hands high on the psychozoic plain”  the coryphodon was horrified the dinoceras was shocked and they chased young eohippus but he skipped away and mocked then they laughed enormous laughter and they groaned enormous groans and they bade young eohippus go view his father’s bones said they “you always were as small and mean as now we see and that’s conclusive evidence that you’re always going to be what be a great tall handsome beast with hoofs to gallop on why you’d have to change your nature  said the loxolophodon they considered him disposed of and retired with gait serene that was the way they argued in “the early eocene” there was once an anthropoidal ape far smarter than the rest and everything that they could do he always did the best so they naturally disliked him and they gave him shoulders cool and when they had to mention him they said he was a fool  cried this pretentious ape one day “i’m going to be a man and stand upright and hunt and fight and conquer all i can i’m going to cut down forest trees to make my houses higher i’m going to kill the mastodon i’m going to make a fire”  loud screamed the anthropoidal apes with laughter wild and gay they tried to catch that boastful one but he always got away so they yelled at him in chorus which he minded not a whit and they pelted him with cocoanuts which didn’t seem to hit and then they gave him reasons which they thought of much avail to prove how his preposterous attempt was sure to fail said the sages “in the first place the thing cannot be done and second if it could be it would not be any fun and third and most conclusive and admitting no reply you would have to change your nature we should like to see you try” they chuckled then triumphantly these lean and hairy shapes for these things passed as arguments with the anthropoidal apes  there was once a neolithic man an enterprising wight who made his chopping implements unusually bright unusually clever he unusually brave and he drew delightful mammoths on the borders of his cave to his neolithic neighbours who were startled and surprised said he “my friends in course of time we shall be civilized we are going to live in cities we are going to fight in wars we are going to eat three times a day without the natural cause we are going to turn life upside down about a thing called gold we are going to want the earth and take as much as we can hold we are going to wear great piles of stuff outside our proper skins we are going to have diseases and accomplishments and sins”  then they all rose up in fury against their boastful friend for prehistoric patience cometh quickly to an end said one “this is chimerical utopian absurd” said another “what a stupid life too dull upon my word” cried all before such things can come you idiotic child you must alter human nature ” and they all sat back and smiled thought they “an answer to that last it will be hard to find” it was a clinching argument to the neolithic mind

 tip their mouths open to the sky turquoise amber the deep green with fluted handle pitcher the size of two thumbs tiny lip and graceful waist  here we place the smallest flower which could have lived invisibly in loose soil beside the road sprig of succulent rosemary bowing mint  they grow deeper in the center of the table  here we entrust the small life thread fragment breath and it bends it waits all day as the bread cools and the children open their gray copybooks to shape the letter that looks like a chimney rising out of a house  and what do the headlines say  nothing of the smaller petal perfectly arranged inside the larger petal or the way tinted glass filters light men and boys praying when they died fall out of their skins the whole alphabet of living heads and tails of words sentences the way they said “ya’allah” when astonished or “ya’ani” for “i mean” a crushed glass under the feet still shines but the child of hebron sleeps with the thud of her brothers falling and the long sorrow of the color red

 when my dad first started to die all my mom could remember was the time he kicked her out after they first started dating so that he could go play golf it is the sort of thing we all remember when we feel death upon us i remember he died twice and once in my dream i just had to see him all nursed and swaddled as if he were sleeping but he wasn’t sleeping i stood in the white light of the nursing home bathroom with the sun spilling everywhere on me and tried to talk to him but never he’d never listen people don’t always listen to you when they are dead but that’s not sad i get tired and i don’t listen to one goddamn thing you are saying but that is because most of the time you bore me and when i am finally asleep it is really nice just to dream i have seen a lot of things in this life but one thing i saw most readily was that despite his eternal heartbreak and girlish silliness mike’s face was kind of sweet a sweet wind he is going to think it is weird that i put him in this poem but i don’t think it is weird that i put him in this poem

 did you ever have a family dark dining room bright kitchen white steam from the big pot my mother’s stirring reaching in wavy tendrils to her face around her face all the way around to me at the table then beyond me into the darkness where my brother is  were you ever a child i’m hungry but i know we’ll eat soon so even the hunger’s sweet  did you ever really have a brother he’s singing there in the dark corner beside the stereo the volume turned down so low all we hear is him his voice and his eyes are closed so that there’s nothing around him anywhere that might reveal he isn’t who the song insists he is  and that is irresistible unforgettable someone to whom as in imaginary gardens where “the nectarine and curious peach into my hands themselves do reach” love comes as soon as called comes just as dreamed  did any of this ever happen the hunger’s sweet it’s as if the song weaves through the fragrance of the braiding steam from him to me to her to me to him because her eyes are closed now too her slippered feet tap caper a soft shoe while the ladle sways in her hand as she stirs  were you ever a child i know i’ll eat soon did you ever really have a brother you should have heard him his voice was unforgettable irresistible his voice was an imaginary garden woven through with fragrance  did you ever have a family their eyes are closed that’s how i know we’re there inside it it’s made of sound and steam that weaves between dark dining room bright kitchen we’re there because i’m hungry and we’ll all be eating soon together and the hunger’s sweet

 from twelfth night  come away come away death and in sad cypress let me be laid fly away fly away breath i am slain by a fair cruel maid my shroud of white stuck all with yew o prepare it my part of death no one so true did share it  not a flower not a flower sweet on my black coffin let there be strown not a friend not a friend greet my poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown a thousand thousand sighs to save lay me o where sad true lover never find my grave to weep there

NEW POEM
 1  i celebrate myself and sing myself and what i assume you shall assume for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you  i loafe and invite my soul i lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass  my tongue every atom of my blood form’d from this soil this air born here of parents born here from parents the same and their parents the same i now thirtyseven years old in perfect health begin hoping to cease not till death  creeds and schools in abeyance retiring back a while sufficed at what they are but never forgotten i harbor for good or bad i permit to speak at every hazard nature without check with original energy  2  houses and rooms are full of perfumes the shelves are crowded with perfumes i breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it the distillation would intoxicate me also but i shall not let it  the atmosphere is not a perfume it has no taste of the distillation it is odorless it is for my mouth forever i am in love with it i will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked i am mad for it to be in contact with me  the smoke of my own breath echoes ripples buzz’d whispers loveroot silkthread crotch and vine my respiration and inspiration the beating of my heart the passing of blood and air through my lungs the sniff of green leaves and dry leaves and of the shore and darkcolor’d searocks and of hay in the barn the sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind a few light kisses a few embraces a reaching around of arms the play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag the delight alone or in the rush of the streets or along the fields and hillsides the feeling of health the fullnoon trill the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun  have you reckon’d a thousand acres much have you reckon’d the earth much have you practis’d so long to learn to read have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems  stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems you shall possess the good of the earth and sun there are millions of suns left you shall no longer take things at second or third hand nor look through the eyes of the dead nor feed on the spectres in books you shall not look through my eyes either nor take things from me you shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self  3  i have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the beginning and the end but i do not talk of the beginning or the end  there was never any more inception than there is now nor any more youth or age than there is now and will never be any more perfection than there is now nor any more heaven or hell than there is now  urge and urge and urge always the procreant urge of the world  out of the dimness opposite equals advance always substance and increase always sex always a knit of identity always distinction always a breed of life  to elaborate is no avail learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so  sure as the most certain sure plumb in the uprights well entretied braced in the beams stout as a horse affectionate haughty electrical i and this mystery here we stand  clear and sweet is my soul and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul  lack one lacks both and the unseen is proved by the seen till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn  showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things while they discuss i am silent and go bathe and admire myself  welcome is every organ and attribute of me and of any man hearty and clean not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile and none shall be less familiar than the rest  i am satisfiedi see dance laugh sing as the hugging and loving bedfellow sleeps at my side through the night and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty shall i postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes that they turn from gazing after and down the road and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two and which is ahead  4  trippers and askers surround me people i meet the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city i live in or the nation the latest dates discoveries inventions societies authors old and new my dinner dress associates looks compliments dues the real or fancied indifference of some man or woman i love the sickness of one of my folks or of myself or illdoing or loss or lack of money or depressions or exaltations battles the horrors of fratricidal war the fever of doubtful news the fitful events these come to me days and nights and go from me again but they are not the me myself  apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am stands amused complacent compassionating idle unitary looks down is erect or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest looking with sidecurved head curious what will come next both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it  backward i see in my own days where i sweated through fog with linguists and contenders i have no mockings or arguments i witness and wait  5  i believe in you my soul the other i am must not abase itself to you and you must not be abased to the other  loafe with me on the grass loose the stop from your throat not words not music or rhyme i want not custom or lecture not even the best only the lull i like the hum of your valvèd voice  i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning how you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me and parted the shirt from my bosombone and plunged your tongue to my barestript heart and reach’d till you felt my beard and reach’d till you held my feet  swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own and that all the men ever born are also my brothers and the women my sisters and lovers and that a kelson of the creation is love and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields and brown ants in the little wells beneath them and mossy scabs of the worm fence heap’d stones elder mullein and pokeweed  6  a child said what is the grass fetching it to me with full hands how could i answer the child i do not know what it is any more than he  i guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green stuff woven  or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners that we may see and remark and say whose  or i guess the grass is itself a child the produced babe of the vegetation  or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic and it means sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones growing among black folks as among white kanuck tuckahoe congressman cuff i give them the same i receive them the same  and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves  tenderly will i use you curling grass it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men it may be if i had known them i would have loved them it may be you are from old people or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps and here you are the mothers’ laps  this grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers darker than the colorless beards of old men dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths  o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing  i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women and the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken soon out of their laps  what do you think has become of the young and old men and what do you think has become of the women and children  they are alive and well somewhere the smallest sprout shows there is really no death and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it and ceas’d the moment life appear’d  all goes onward and outward nothing collapses and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier  7  has any one supposed it lucky to be born i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die and i know it  i pass death with the dying and birth with the newwash’d babe and am not contain’d between my hat and boots and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good  i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth i am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and fathomless as myself they do not know how immortal but i know  every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female for me those that have been boys and that love women for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted for me the sweetheart and the old maid for me mothers and the mothers of mothers for me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears for me children and the begetters of children  undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no and am around tenacious acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away  8  the little one sleeps in its cradle i lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flies with my hand  the youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill i peeringly view them from the top  the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair i note where the pistol has fallen  the blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of bootsoles talk of the promenaders the heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor the snowsleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snowballs the hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rous’d mobs the flap of the curtain’d litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital the meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall the excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes what groans of overfed or halfstarv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes what living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls restrain’d by decorum arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances rejections with convex lips i mind them or the show or resonance of themi come and i depart  9  the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready the dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged the armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow  i am there i help i came stretch’d atop of the load i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other i jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps  10  alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night kindling a fire and broiling the freshkill’d game falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side  the yankee clipper is under her skysails she cuts the sparkle and scud  my eyes settle the land i bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck  the boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me i tuck’d my trowserends in my boots and went and had a good time you should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle  i saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west the bride was a red girl her father and his friends sat near crosslegged and dumbly smoking they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders on a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand she had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet  the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile through the swung halfdoor of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him and brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet and gave him a room that enter’d from my own and gave him some coarse clean clothes and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness and remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north i had him sit next me at table my firelock lean’d in the corner  11  twentyeight young men bathe by the shore twentyeight young men and all so friendly twentyeight years of womanly life and all so lonesome  she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window  which of the young men does she like the best ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her  where are you off to lady for i see you you splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room  dancing and laughing along the beach came the twentyninth bather the rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them  the beards of the young men glisten’d with wet it ran from their long hair little streams pass’d all over their bodies  an unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs  the young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to the sun they do not ask who seizes fast to them they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch they do not think whom they souse with spray  12  the butcherboy puts off his killingclothes or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown  blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil each has his mainsledge they are all out there is a great heat in the fire  from the cinderstrew’d threshold i follow their movements the lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms overhand the hammers swing overhand so slow overhand so sure they do not hasten each man hits in his place  13  the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses the block swags underneath on its tiedover chain the negro that drives the long dray of the stoneyard steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the stringpiece his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hipband his glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs  i behold the picturesque giant and love him and i do not stop there i go with the team also  in me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as forward sluing to niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing absorbing all to myself and for this song  oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade what is that you express in your eyes it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life  my tread scares the wooddrake and woodduck on my distant and daylong ramble they rise together they slowly circle around  i believe in those wing’d purposes and acknowledge red yellow white playing within me and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else and the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me  14  the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night yahonk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky  the sharphoof’d moose of the north the cat on the housesill the chickadee the prairiedog the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats the brood of the turkeyhen and she with her halfspread wings i see in them and myself the same old law  the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections they scorn the best i can do to relate them  i am enamour’d of growing outdoors of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls and the drivers of horses i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out  what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me me going in for my chances spending for vast returns adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me not asking the sky to come down to my good will scattering it freely forever  15  the

dwarfs voices of cycles of preparation and accretion and of the threads that connect the stars and of wombs and of the fatherstuff and of the rights of them the others are down upon of the deform’d trivial flat foolish despised fog in the air beetles rolling balls of dung  through me forbidden voices voices of sexes and lusts voices veil’d and i remove the veil voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d  i do not press my fingers across my mouth i keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart copulation is no more rank to me than death is  i believe in the flesh and the appetites seeing hearing feeling are miracles and each part and tag of me is a miracle  divine am i inside and out and i make holy whatever i touch or am touch’d from the scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer this head more than churches bibles and all the creeds  if i worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body or any part of it translucent mould of me it shall be you shaded ledges and rests it shall be you firm masculine colter it shall be you whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you you my rich blood your milky stream pale strippings of my life breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you my brain it shall be your occult convolutions root of wash’d sweetflag timorous pondsnipe nest of guarded duplicate eggs it shall be you mix’d tussled hay of head beard brawn it shall be you trickling sap of maple fibre of manly wheat it shall be you sun so generous it shall be you vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you you sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you winds whose softtickling genitals rub against me it shall be you broad muscular fields branches of live oak loving lounger in my winding paths it shall be you hands i have taken face i have kiss’d mortal i have ever touch’d it shall be you  i dote on myself there is that lot of me and all so luscious each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy i cannot tell how my ankles bend nor whence the cause of my faintest wish nor the cause of the friendship i emit nor the cause of the friendship i take again  that i walk up my stoop i pause to consider if it really be a morningglory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books  to behold the daybreak the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows the air tastes good to my palate  hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding scooting obliquely high and low  something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs seas of bright juice suffuse heaven  the earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction the heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head the mocking taunt see then whether you shall be master  25  dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me if i could not now and always send sunrise out of me  we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak  my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds  speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself it provokes me forever it says sarcastically walt you contain enough why don’t you let it out then  come now i will not be tantalized you conceive too much of articulation do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded waiting in gloom protected by frost the dirt receding before my prophetical screams i underlying causes to balance them at last my knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day  my final merit i refuse you i refuse putting from me what i really am encompass worlds but never try to encompass me i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you  writing and talk do not prove me i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic  26  now i will do nothing but listen to accrue what i hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it  i hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flames clack of sticks cooking my meals i hear the sound i love the sound of the human voice i hear all sounds running together combined fused or following sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh of workpeople at their meals the angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick the judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncing a deathsentence the heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the refrain of the anchorlifters the ring of alarmbells the cry of fire the whirr of swiftstreaking engines and hosecarts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights the steam whistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars the slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two they go to guard some corpse the flagtops are draped with black muslin  i hear the violoncello ’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint i hear the key’d cornet it glides quickly in through my ears it shakes madsweet pangs through my belly and breast  i hear the chorus it is a grand opera ah this indeed is musicthis suits me  a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full  i hear the train’d soprano what work with hers is this the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess’d them it sails me i dab with bare feet they are lick’d by the indolent waves i am cut by bitter and angry hail i lose my breath steep’d amid honey’d morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death  at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles and that we call being  27  to be in any form what is that round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither if nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough  mine is no callous shell i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me  i merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy to touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as i can stand  28  is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity flames and ether making a rush for my veins treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip behaving licentious toward me taking no denial depriving me of my best as for a purpose unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasturefields immodestly sliding the fellowsenses away they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me no consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me  the sentries desert every other part of me they have left me helpless to a red marauder they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me  i am given up by traitors i talk wildly i have lost my wits i and nobody else am the greatest traitor i went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there  you villain touch what are you doing my breath is tight in its throat unclench your floodgates you are too much for me  29  blind loving wrestling touch sheath’d hooded sharptooth’d touch did it make you ache so leaving me  parting track’d by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward  sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital landscapes projected masculine fullsized and golden  30  all truths wait in all things they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon the insignificant is as big to me as any what is less or more than a touch  logic and sermons never convince the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul  only what proves itself to every man and woman is so only what nobody denies is so  a minute and a drop of me settle my brain i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific and until one and all shall delight us and we them  31  i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars and the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg of the wren and the treetoad is a chefd’œuvre for the highest and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery and the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels  i find i incorporate gneiss coal longthreaded moss fruits grains esculent roots and am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons but call any thing back again when i desire it  in vain the speeding or shyness in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods in vain the razorbill’d auk sails far north to labrador i follow quickly i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff  32  i think i could turn and live with animals they are so placid and selfcontain’d i stand and look at them long and long  they do not sweat and whine about their condition they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of owning things not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth  so they show their relations to me and i accept them they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their possession  i wonder where they get those tokens did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them  myself moving forward then and now and forever gathering and showing more always and with velocity infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers picking out here one that i love and now go with him on brotherly terms  a gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses head high in the forehead wide between the ears limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving  his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him his wellbuilt limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return  i but use you a minute then i resign you stallion why do i need your paces when i myself outgallop them even as i stand or sit passing faster than you  33  space and time now i see it is true what i guess’d at what i guess’d when i loaf’d on the grass what i guess’d while i lay alone in my bed and again as i walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning  my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in seagaps i skirt sierras my palms cover continents i am afoot with my vision  by the city’s quadrangular housesin log huts camping with lumbermen along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed weeding my onionpatch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips crossing savannas trailing in forests prospecting golddigging girdling the trees of a new purchase scorch’d ankledeep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the shallow river where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the buck turns furiously at the hunter where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the otter is feeding on fish where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the beaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped tail over the growing sugar over the yellowflower’d cotton plant over the rice in its low moist field over the sharppeak’d farm house with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters over the western persimmon over the longleav’d corn over the delicate blueflower flax over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there with the rest over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low scragged limbs walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot where the bat flies in the seventhmonth eve where the great goldbug drops through the dark where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides where the cheesecloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle the hearthslab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters where triphammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs where the pearshaped balloon is floating aloft floating in it myself and looking composedly down where the lifecar is drawn on the slipnoose where the heat hatches palegreen eggs in the dented sand where the shewhale swims with her calf and never forsakes it where the steamship trails hindways its long pennant of smoke where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water where the halfburn’d brig is riding on unknown currents where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below where the densestarr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments approaching manhattan up by the longstretching island under niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance upon a doorstep upon the horseblock of hard wood outside upon the racecourse or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of baseball at hefestivals with blackguard gibes ironical license bulldances drinking laughter at the cidermill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the juice through a straw at applepeelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find at musters beachparties friendly bees huskings houseraisings where the mockingbird sounds his delicious gurgles cackles screams weeps where the hayrick stands in the barnyard where the drystalks are scatter’d where the broodcow waits in the hovel where the bull advances to do his masculine work where the stud to the mare where the cock is treading the hen where the heifers browse where geese nip their food with short jerks where sundown shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near where the hummingbird shimmers where the neck of the longlived swan is curving and winding where the laughinggull scoots by the shore where she laughs her nearhuman laugh where beehives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds where bandneck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees where the yellowcrown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon where the katydid works her chromatic reed on the walnuttree over the well through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silverwired leaves through the saltlick or orange glade or under conical firs through the gymnasium through the curtain’d saloon through the office or public hall pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign pleas’d with the new and old pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher impress’d seriously at the campmeeting looking in at the shopwindows of broadway the whole forenoon flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds or down a lane or along the beach my right and left arms round the sides of two friends and i in the middle coming home with the silent and darkcheek’d bushboy behind me he rides at the drape of the day far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet or the moccasin print by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still examining with a candle voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while walking the old hills of judæa with the beautiful gentle god by my side speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty thousand miles speeding with tail’d meteors throwing fireballs like the rest carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly storming enjoying planning loving cautioning backing and filling appearing and disappearing i tread day and night such roads  i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product and look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green  i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul my course runs below the soundings of plummets  i help myself to material and immaterial no guard can shut me off no law prevent me  i anchor my ship for a little while only my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me  i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a pikepointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue  i ascend to the foretruck i take my place late at night in the crow’snest we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them the scenery is plain in all directions the whitetopt mountains show in the distance i fling out my fancies toward them we are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon to be engaged we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still feet and caution or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe  i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips  my voice is the wife’s voice the screech by the rail of the stairs they fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d  i understand the large hearts of heroes the courage of present times and all times how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship and death chasing it up and down the storm how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of days and faithful of nights and chalk’d in large letters on a boardbe of good cheer we will not desert you how he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up how he saved the drifting company at last how the lank loosegown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves how the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick and the sharplipp’d unshaved men all this i swallow it tastes good i like it well it becomes mine i am the man i suffer’d i was there  the disdain and calmness of martyrs the mother of old condemn’d for a witch burnt with dry wood her children gazing on the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence blowing cover’d with sweat the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous buckshot and the bullets all these i feel or am  i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen i clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinn’d with the ooze of my skin i fall on the weeds and stones the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whipstocks  agonies are one of my changes of garments i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the wounded person my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe  i am the mash’d fireman with breastbone broken tumbling walls buried me in their debris heat and smoke i inspired i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels they have clear’d the beams away they tenderly lift me forth  i lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared of their firecaps the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches  distant and dead resuscitate they show as the dial or move as the hands of me i am the clock myself  i am an old artillerist i tell of my fort’s bombardment i am there again  again the long roll of the drummers again the attacking cannon mortars again to my listening ears the cannon responsive  i take part i see and hear the whole the cries curses roar the plaudits for wellaim’d shots the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs the fall of grenades through the rent roof the fanshaped explosion the whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air  again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves with his hand he gasps through the clot mind not memindthe entrenchments  34  now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth i tell not the fall of alamo not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo ’tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men  retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s nine times their number was the price they took in advance their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone they treated for an honorable capitulation receiv’d writing and seal gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war  they were the glory of the race of rangers matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters not a single one over thirty years of age  the second firstday morning they were brought out in squads and massacred it was beautiful early summer the work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight  none obey’d the command to kneel some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight a few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead lay together the maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt the newcomers saw them there some halfkill’d attempted to crawl away these were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets a youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him the three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood  at eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men  35  would you hear of an oldtime seafight would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars list to the yarn as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me  our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you said he his was the surly english pluck and there is no tougher or truer and never was and never will be along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us  we closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touch’d my captain lash’d fast with his own hands  we had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water on our lowergundeck two large pieces had burst at the first fire killing all around and blowing up overhead  fighting at sundown fighting at dark ten o’clock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gain and five feet of water reported the masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold to give them a chance for themselves  the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust  our frigate takes fire the other asks if we demand quarter if our colors are struck and the fighting done  now i laugh content for i hear the voice of my little captain we have not struck he composedly crieswe have just begun our part of the fighting  only three guns are in use one is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks  the tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially the maintop they hold out bravely during the whole of the action  not a moment’s cease the leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powdermagazine  one of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking  serene stands the little captain he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low his eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns  toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us  36  stretch’d and still lies the midnight two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d the captain on the quarterdeck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves black and impassive guns litter of powderparcels strong scent a few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining delicate sniffs of seabreeze smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore deathmessages given in charge to survivors the hiss of the surgeon’s knife the gnawing teeth of his saw wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short wild scream and long dull tapering groan these so these irretrievable  37  you laggards there on guard look to your arms in at the conquer’d doors they crowd i am possess’d embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering see myself in prison shaped like another man and feel the dull unintermitted pain  for me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch it is i let out in the morning and barr’d at night  not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but i am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side i am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips  not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too and am tried and sentenced  not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp my face is ashcolor’d my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat  askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in them i project my hat sit shamefaced and beg  38  enough enough enough somehow i have been stunn’d stand back give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head slumbers dreams gaping i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake  that i could forget the mockers and insults that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning  i remember now i resume the overstaid fraction the grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it or to any graves corpses rise gashes heal fastenings roll from me  i troop forth replenish’d with supreme power one of an

the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in the circle of obis helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist drinking mead from the skullcup to shastas and vedas admirant minding the koran walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife beating the serpentskin drum accepting the gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing assuredly that he is divine to the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising or sitting patiently in a pew ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting deadlike till my spirit arouses me looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits  one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey  downhearted doubters dull and excluded frivolous sullen moping angry affected dishearten’d atheistical i know every one of you i know the sea of torment doubt despair and unbelief  how the flukes splash how they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood  be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers i take my place among you as much as among any the past is the push of you me all precisely the same and what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely the same  i do not know what is untried and afterward but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail  each who passes is consider’d each who stops is consider’d not a single one can it fail  it cannot fail the young man who died and was buried nor the young woman who died and was put by his side nor the little child that peep’d in at the door and then drew back and was never seen again nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them nor the present nor the least wisp that is known  44  it is time to explain myselflet us stand up  what is known i strip away i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown  the clock indicates the momentbut what does eternity indicate  we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them  births have brought us richness and variety and other births will bring us richness and variety  i do not call one greater and one smaller that which fills its period and place is equal to any  were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister i am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation what have i to do with lamentation  i am an acme of things accomplish’d and i an encloser of things to be  my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps all below duly travel’d and still i mount and mount  rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon  long i was hugg’d closelong and long  immense have been the preparations for me faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me  cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings they sent influences to look after what was to hold me  before i was born out of my mother generations guided me my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it  for it the nebula cohered to an orb the long slow strata piled to rest it on vast vegetables gave it sustenance monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care  all forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me now on this spot i stand with my robust soul  45  o span of youth everpush’d elasticity o manhood balanced florid and full  my lovers suffocate me crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night crying by day ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and chirping over my head calling my name from flowerbeds vines tangled underbrush lighting on every moment of my life bussing my body with soft balsamic busses noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine  old age superbly rising o welcome ineffable grace of dying days  every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows after and out of itself and the dark hush promulges as much as any  i open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems  wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and forever outward  my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them  there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would not avail in the long run we should surely bring up again where we now stand and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther  a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do not hazard the span or make it impatient they are but parts any thing is but a part  see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that count ever so much there is limitless time around that  my rendezvous is appointed it is certain the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there  46  i know i have the best of time and space and was never measured and never will be measured  i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all my signs are a rainproof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair i have no chair no church no philosophy i lead no man to a dinnertable library exchange but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll my left hand hooking you round the waist my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road  not i not any one else can travel that road for you you must travel it for yourself  it is not far it is within reach perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land  shoulder your duds dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go  if you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip and in due time you shall repay the same service to me for after we start we never lie by again  this day before dawn i ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we be fill’d and satisfied then and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond  you are also asking me questions and i hear you i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself  sit a while dear son here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes i kiss you with a goodby kiss and open the gate for your egress hence  long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams now i wash the gum from your eyes you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life  long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore now i will you to be a bold swimmer to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout and laughingly dash with your hair  47  i am the teacher of athletes he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher  the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts firstrate to ride to fight to hit the bull’s eye to sail a skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox over all latherers and those welltann’d to those that keep out of the sun  i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me i follow you whoever you are from the present hour my words itch at your ears till you understand them  i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat it is you talking just as much as myself i act as the tongue of you tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen’d  i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house and i swear i will never translate myself at all only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air  if you would understand me go to the heights or watershore the nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves a key the maul the oar the handsaw second my words  no shutter’d room or school can commune with me but roughs and little children better than they  the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day the farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice in vessels that sail my words sail i go with fishermen and seamen and love them  the soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine on the night ere the pending battle many seek me and i do not fail them on that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me  my face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon the young mother and old mother comprehend me the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are they and all would resume what i have told them  48  i have said that the soul is not more than the body and i have said that the body is not more than the soul and nothing not god is greater to one than one’s self is and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe and i say to any man or woman let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes  and i say to mankind be not curious about god for i who am curious about each am not curious about god no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death  i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself  why should i wish to see god better than this day i see something of god each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is sign’d by god’s name and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoe’er i go others will punctually come for ever and ever  49  and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to try to alarm me  to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes i see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape  and as to you corpse i think you are good manure but that does not offend me i smell the white roses sweetscented and growing i reach to the leafy lips i reach to the polish’d breasts of melons  and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before  i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven o sunso grass of graveso perpetual transfers and promotions if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing  of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight toss sparkles of day and dusktoss on the black stems that decay in the muck toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs  i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small  50  there is that in mei do not know what it isbut i know it is in me  wrench’d and sweatycalm and cool then my body becomes i sleepi sleep long  i do not know itit is without nameit is a word unsaid it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol  something it swings on more than the earth i swing on to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me  perhaps i might tell more outlines i plead for my brothers and sisters  do you see o my brothers and sisters it is not chaos or deathit is form union planit is eternal lifeit is happiness  51  the past and present wilti have fill’d them emptied them and proceed to fill my next fold of the future  listener up there what have you to confide to me look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening talk honestly no one else hears you and i stay only a minute longer  do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes  i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the doorslab  who has done his day’s work who will soonest be through with his supper who wishes to walk with me  will you speak before i am gone will you prove already too late  52  the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab and my loitering  i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world  the last scud of day holds back for me it flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds it coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk  i depart as air i shake my white locks at the runaway sun i effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags  i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love if you want me again look for me under your bootsoles  you will hardly know who i am or what i mean but i shall be good health to you nevertheless and filter and fibre your blood  failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged missing me one place search another i stop somewhere waiting for you

 after porfirio barba jacob’s canción de la vida profunda variable changeable yes there are days when people like us are like that maybe under  some other sky something like glory smiles on us maybe there life is clear maybe there things open up  on the way the sea stretches out to the horizon but us we’re blown by chance the way wind blows  blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way   and then there are days when we feel april the fields of april making us feel our bodies  longing to be held and fucked into oblivion bodies fertile as a field in april swollen  trembling to be touched and under the influences of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured  into us like rain that thing called “soul” sprouts and branches and entangles us  in lush bowers and thickets of illusion   oh yes days come along when we’re calm clear childhood sunsets lagoons rippling sapphire  days when a verse a sudden whistle days when a mountain and bird passing over it days when even our own pain  and what we feel it to be like make us smile and sure there are days when were so disgusting so sordid to ourselves  it’s like we’re dark stone in the darkness inside flint then nighttime surprises us  its lamplight dizzying cold profuse glinting off tossed coins of the good the terrible  shining with the gleam of that primal metal   and other days come come when women want to cry their come cries and use us  as their own days when we’re itching to get a woman naked and then we can’t face it can’t  stand it somehow they want us but we don’t know how to want them back arm tightening around  a waist hand cupping a breast we don’t dare touch the roundness of an apple or a pear  the round earth spins us off into space   and then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove  sounds like weeping and what some idiot called the soul whines and wails and carries on  with what some other idiot calls “the pain of the world” and maybe not god himself that absolute fool can make that wind less cutting or make it stop   and then there comes certain to come oh my earth i love beyond any of my days a day    a day    a day  when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor up out of the bottom muck and nothing can withstand  that wind blowing by talking to itself talking talking    and the day is mine and yours and every living thing’s     the day when nobody and nothing can keep us from getting up and going no matter who we are     the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving

 drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss but in the cup and i’ll not look for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of jove’s nectar sup i would not change for thine  i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honouring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be but thou thereon didst only breathe and sent’st it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee

 from fairest creatures we desire increase that thereby beauty’s rose might never die but as the riper should by time decease his tender heir might bear his memory but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes feed’st thy light’s flame with selfsubstantial fuel making a famine where abundance lies thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel though that art now the world’s fresh ornament and only herald to the gaudy spring within thine own bud buriest thy content and tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding pity the world or else this glutton be to eat the world’s due by the grave and thee

NEW POEM
 i   what is the flesh and blood compounded of but a few moments in the life of time this prowling of the cells litigious love wears the long claw of flesharguing crime consider the first settlers of our bone observe how busily they sued the dust estopped forever by the last dusted stone it is a pity that two brothers must perceive a canker of perennial flower to make them brothers in mortality perfect this treason to the murderous hour if you would win the hard identity of brothersa long race for men to run nor quite achieved when the perfection’s won   ii   near to me as perfection in the blood and more mysterious far is this my brother a light vaulted into your solitude it studied burns lest you its rage should smother it is a flame obscure to any eyes most like the fire that warms the deepest grave the cold grave is the deepest of our lies to which our blood is the indentured slave the fire that burns most secretly in you does not expend you hidden and alone the studious fire consumes not one but two me also marrowing the selfsame bone our property in fire is death in life flawing the rocky fundament with strife   iii   then brother you would never think me vain or rude if i should mention dignity think little of it dignity’s the stain of mortal sin that knows humility let me design the hour when you were born since if that’s vain it’s only childlike so like an attempting frost on april corn considerate death would hardly let you go reckon the costif you would validate once more our slavery to circumstance not by contempt of a prescriptive fate but in your bearing towards an hour of chance it is a part so humble and so proud you’ll think but little of it in your shroud   iv   the times have changed why do you make a fuss for privilege when there’s no law of form who of our kin was pusillanimous a fine bull galloping into a storm why none unless you count it arrogance to cultivate humility in pride to look but casually and halfaskance on boots and spurs that went a devil’s ride there was remember a virginian who took himself to be brute nature’s law cared little what men thought him a tall man who meditated calmly what he saw until he freed his negroes lest he be too strict with nature and than they less free   v   our elder brother whom we had not seen these twenty years until you brought him back from the cyclonic west where he had been sent by the shaking fury in the track we know so well wound in these arteries you other brother i have become strange to you and you must study ways to seize mortality that knows how to derange corpuscles for designs that it may choose your blood is altered by the sudden death of one who of all persons could not use life half so well as death let’s look beneath that life perhaps hers only is our rest to study this all lifetime may be best   vi   the fire i praise was once perduring flame till it snuffs with our generation out no matter it’s all one it’s but a name not as late honeysuckle half so stout so think upon it how the fire burns blue its hottest when the flame is all but spent thank god the fuel is low we’ll not renew that length of flame into our firmament think too the rooftree crackles and will fall on us who saw the sacred fury’s height seated in her tall chair with the black shawl from head to foot burning with motherly light more spectral than november dusk could mix with sunset to blaze on her pale crucifix   vii   this message hastens lest we both go down scattered with no character to death death is untutored with an ignorant frown for precious identities of breath but you perhaps will say confusion stood a vulture near the heart of all our kin i’ve heard the echoes in a dark tangled wood yet never saw i a face peering within these evils being anonymities we fulminate in exile from the earth aged exclusions of blood memories those superstitions of explosive birth until there’ll be of us not anything but foolish death who is confusion’s king   viii   not power nor the casual hand of god shall keep us whole in our dissevering air it is a stink upon this pleasant sod so foul the hovering buzzard sees it fair i ask you will it end therefore tonight and the moth tease again the windy flame or spiders eating their loves hide in the night at last drowsy with selfdevouring shame call it the house of atreus where we live which one of us the greek perplexed with crime questions the future bring that lucid sieve to strain the appointed particles of time whether by corinth or by thebes we go the way is brief but the fixed doom not so   ix   captains of industry your aimless power awakens harsh velleities of time let you brother captaining your hour be zealous that your numbers are all prime lest false division with sly mathematic plunder the inner mansion of the blood the thracian swollen with pride besiege the attic invader foraging the sacred wood yet the prime secret whose simplicity your towering engine hammers to reduce though driven holds that bulwark of the sea which breached will turn unspeaking fury loose to drown out him who swears to rectify infinity that has nor ear nor eye

 my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee i was sired and weaned in a tropic world the palm tree and banana leaf mango and coconut breadfruit and rubber trees know me  warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood i belong with the smell of fresh pine with the trail of coon and the spring growth of wild onion  i am no hothouse bulb to be reared in steamheated flats with the music of el and subway in my ears walled in by steel and wood and brick far from the sky  i want the cotton fields tabacco and the cane i want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground restless music is in my heart and i am eager to be gone  o southland sorrow home melody beating in my bone and blood how long will the klan of hate the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own

 through the window screen i can see an angle of grey roof and the silence that spreads in the branches of the pecan tree as the sun goes down i am waiting for a lover i am alone in a solitude that vibrates like the cicada in hot midmorning that waits like the lobed sassafras leaf just before its dark green turns into red that waits like the honeybee in the mouth of the purple lobelia  while i wait i can hear the random clink of one fork against a plate the woman next door is eating supper alone she is sixty perhaps and for many years has eaten by herself the tomatoes the corn and okra that she grows in her backyard garden her small metallic sound persists as quiet almost as the windless silence persists like the steady random click of a redbird cracking a few more seeds before the sun gets too low she does not hurry she does not linger  her younger neighbors think that she is lonely but i know what sufficiency she may possess i know what can be gathered from year to year gathered from what is near to hand as i do elderberries that bend in damp thickets by the road gathered and preserved jars and jars shining in rows of claret red made at times with help a friend or a lover but consumed long after long after they are gone and i sit alone at the kitchen table  and when i sit in the last heat of sunday afternoons on the porch steps in the acid breath of the boxwoods i also know desolation the week is over the coming night will not lift i am exhausted from making each day my family my children live in other states the women i love in other towns i would rather be here than with them in the old ways but when all that’s left of the sunset is the red reflection underneath the clouds when i get up and come in to fix supper in the darkened kitchen i am often lonely for them  in the morning and the evening we are by ourselves the woman next door and i still we persist i open the drawer to get out the silverware she goes to her garden to pull weeds and pick the crookneck squash that turn yellow with late summer i walk down to the pond in the morning to watch and wait for the blue heron who comes at first light to feed on minnows that swim through her shadow in the water she stays until the day grows so bright that she cannot endure it and leaves with her hunger unsatisfied she bows her wings and slowly lifts into flight grey and slate blue against a paler sky i know she will come back i see the light create a russet curve of land on the farther bank where the wild rice bends heavy and ripe under the first blackbirds i know she will come back i see the light curve in the fall and rise of her wing

 people are putting up storm windows now or were this morning until the heavy rain drove them indoors so coming home at noon i saw storm windows lying on the ground framefull of rain through the water and glass i saw the crushed grass how it seemed to stream away in lines like seaweed on the tide or blades of wheat leaning under the wind the ripple and splash of rain on the blurred glass seemed that it briefly said as i walked by something i should have liked to say to you something  the dry grass bent under the pane brimful of bouncing water  something of a swaying clarity which blindly echoes this lonely afternoon of memories and missed desires while the wintry rain unspeakable the distance in the mind runs on the standing windows and away

 what thing unto mine ear wouldst thou conveywhat secret thing o wandering water ever whispering surely thy speech shall be of her thou water o thou whispering wanderer what message dost thou bring  say hath not love leaned low this hour beside thy far wellhead and there through jealous hollowed fingers said the thing that most i long to know murmuring with curls all dabbled in thy flow and washed lips rosy red  he told it to thee there where thy voice hath a louder tone but where it welters to this little moan his will decrees that i should hear now speak for with the silence is no fear and i am all alone  shall time not still endow one hour with life and i and she slake in one kiss the thirst of memory say streams lest love should disavow thy service and the bird upon the bough sing first to tell it me  what whisperest thou nay why name the dead hours i mind them well their ghosts in many darkened doorways dwell with desolate eyes to know them by that hour must still be born ere it can die of that id have thee tell  but hear before thou speak withhold i pray the vain behest that while the maze hath still its bower for quest my burning heart should cease to seek be sure that love ordained for souls more meek his roadside dells of rest  stream when this silver thread in floodtime is a torrent brown may any bulwark bind thy foaming crown shall not the waters surge and spread and to the crannied boulders of their bed still shoot the dead drift down  let no rebuke find place in speech of thine or it shall prove that thou dost ill expound the words of love even as thine eddys rippling race would blur the perfect image of his face i will have none thereof  o learn and understand that gainst the wrongs himself did wreak love sought her aid until her shadowy cheek and eyes beseeching gave command and compassed in her close compassionate hand my heart must burn and speak  for then at last we spoke what eyes so oft had told to eyes through that longlingering silence whose halfsighs alone the buried secret broke which with snatched hands and lips reverberate stroke then from the heart did rise  but she is far away now nor the hours of night grown hoar bring yet to me long gazing from the door the windstirred robe of roseate gray and rosecrown of the hour that leads the day when we shall meet once more  dark as thy blinded wave when brimming midnight floods the glen bright as the laughter of thy runnels when the dawn yields all the light they crave even so these hours to wound and that to save are sisters in loves ken  oh sweet her bending grace then when i kneel beside her feet and sweet her eyes oerhanging heaven and sweet the gathering folds of her embrace and her falln hair at last shed round my face when breaths and tears shall meet  beneath her sheltering hair in the warm silence near her breast our kisses and our sobs shall sink to rest as in some still trance made aware that day and night have wrought to fulness there and love has built our nest  and as in the dim grove when the rains cease that hushed them long mid glistening boughs the songbirds wake to song so from our hearts deepshrined in love while the leaves throb beneath around above the quivering notes shall throng  till tenderest words found vain draw back to wonder mute and deep and closed lips in closed arms a silence keep subdued by memorys circling strain the windrapt sound that the wind brings again while all the willows weep  then by her summoning art shall memory conjure back the sere autumnal springs from many a dying year born dead and bitter to the heart the very ways where now we walk apart who then shall cling so near  and with each thought newgrown some sweet caress or some sweet name lowbreathed shall let me know her thought the same making me rich with every tone and touch of the dear heaven so long unknown that filled my dreams with flame  pity and love shall burn in her pressed cheek and cherishing hands and from the living spirit of love that stands between her lips to soothe and yearn each separate breath shall clasp me round in turn and loose my spirits bands  oh passing sweet and dear then when the worshipped form and face are felt at length in darkling close embrace round which so oft the sun shone clear with mocking light and pitiless atmosphere in many an hour and place  ah me with what proud growth shall that hours thirsting race be run while for each several sweetness still begun afresh endures loves endless drouth sweet hands sweet hair sweet cheeks sweet eyes sweet mouth each singly wooed and won  yet most with the sweet soul shall loves espousals then be knit what time the governing cloud sheds peace from it oer tremulous wings that touch the goal and on the unmeasured height of loves control the lustral fires are lit  therefore when breast and cheek now part from long embraces free each on the other gazing shall but see a self that has no need to speak all things unsought yet nothing more to seek one love in unity  o water wandering past albeit to thee i speak this thing o water thou that wanderest whispering thou keepst thy counsel to the last what spell upon thy bosom should love cast its secret thence to wring  nay must thou hear the tale of the past daysthe heavy debt of life that obdurate time withholdsere yet to win thine ear these prayers prevail and by thy voice loves self with high allhail yield up the amulet  how should all this be told all the sad sum of wayworn days hearts anguish in the impenetrable maze and on the waste uncoloured wold the visible burthen of the sun grown cold and the moons labouring gaze  alas shall hope be nursd on lifes allsuccouring breast in vain and made so perfect only to be slain or shall not rather the sweet thirst even yet rejoice the heart with warmth dispersd and strength grown fair again  stands it not by the door loves hourtill she and i shall meet with bodiless form and unapparent feet that cast no shadow yet before though round its head the dawn begins to pour the breath that makes day sweet  its eyes invisible watch till the dials thinthrown shade be bornyea till the journeying line be laid upon the point that wakes the spell and there in lovelier light than tongue can tell its presence stands arrayd  its soul remembers yet those sunless hours that passed it by and still it hears the nights disconsolate cry and feels the branches wringing wet cast on its brow that may not once forget dumb tears from the blind sky  but oh when now her foot draws near for whose sake night and day were long in weary longing sighed away the hour of love mid airs grown mute shall sing beside the door and loves own lute thrill to the passionate lay  thou knowst for love has told within thine ear o stream how soon that song shall lift its sweet appointed tune o tell me for my lips are cold and in my veins the blood is waxing old even while i beg the boon  so in that hour of sighs assuaged shall we beside this stone yield thanks for grace while in thy mirror shown the twofold image softly lies until we kiss and each in others eyes is imaged all alone  still silent can no art of loves then move thy pity nay to thee let nothing come that owns his sway let happy lovers have no part with thee nor even so sad and poor a heart as thou hast spurned today  today lo night is here the glen grows heavy with some veil risen from the earth or falln to make earth pale and all stands hushed to eye and ear until the nightwind shake the shade like fear and every covert quail  ah by another wave on other airs the hour must come which to thy heart my love shall call me home between the lips of the low cave against that night the lapping waters lave and the dark lips are dumb  but there loves self doth stand and with lifes weary wings far flown and with deaths eyes that make the water moan gathers the water in his hand and they that drink know nought of sky or land but only love alone  o soulsequestered face far offo were that night but now so even beside that stream even i and thou through thirsting lips should draw loves grace and in the zone of that supreme embrace bind aching breast and brow  o water whispering still through the dark into mine ears as with mine eyes is it not now with hers mine eyes that add to thy cold spring wan water wandering water weltering this hidden tide of tears

 driving through this part of louisiana you can pass four prisons in less than an hour the spirit of every age writes eric schlosser is manifest in its public works so this is who we are the jailers the jailed this is the spirit of our age  you wont be back will you asked the inmate who told me he wanted to be a success      try to remember it the way it was try to remember what i wore when i visited the prisons trying to remember how tall was my boy then what books i was teaching trying to remember how i hoped to add one true and lonely word to the host of texts that bear upon incarceration  something about the extrarealism of that peculiar institution caused me to balk also the resistance of poetry to the conventions of evidentiary writing notwithstanding topnotch examples to the contrary mandelstam akhmatova wilde valéry celan desnos et al after all i am not them she asked me to come down my friend the photographer and i went and then i wanted to see whether my art could handle that hoe  trying to remember how my skin felt when i opened an envelope of proofs of deborah lusters intimate aluminum portraits of the inmates at transylvania the site of east carroll parish prison farm a minimumsecurity male prison now closed then angola the site of louisiana state penitentiary maximum security evergrowing then st gabriel the site of the louisiana correctional institution for women the lciw i was electrified by the first facea young handsome man blowing smoke out of his nose behind every anonymous number a very specific face  on the phone my friend had described to me the rich delta grounds of angola 18000 acres angola where the topsoil is measured not in inches but feet the former sugarcane plantation lies at the confluence of rivers and borderland of the verminandvinechoked tunica hills grey pelicans nest on the two prison lakes alongside the airstrip are the grading sheds the endless fields of okra and corn then theres the prison museum the prison radio station the prison monthly magazine the tracking horses and tracking dogs trained by inmates and the treelined neighborhood of freeworld residents their children bused outside the fence to school then the immaculate cinderblock buildings that house the inmates the administration building and the death house the greenhouse and extensive flower bedstake away the fencing and it resembles nothing so much as a college campus the men in maximum number more than the men who lived in my hometown then theres the geriatric unit the awardwinning hospice program the caisson the inmates built to bear the dead in the handbuilt coffins to one of the two graveyards inside the prison in the old burial ground most graves are not identified by name the caisson is pulled by draft horses french quarter style when the champion of the prison rodeo had a heart attack in the fields a riderless horse led the final procession the celebrated inmates uniform was retired to the prison museum  everything about louisiana seems to constitute itself differently from everywhere else in the union the food the idiom the stuff in the trees the critters in the water and the laws napoleonic not mothercountry common law the prisons inevitably mirror differences found in the free world where they came up with their mirrors is another mystery in maximum they are made of metal the definition of the face is a memory  vivid to me is debbie saying that at the trial of her mothers murderer she looked around and saw the people sitting on separate sides of the courtroom the way they do at a wedding the brides people the grooms people and she tried to take in the damage radiating through the distinct linesthe perpetrators side the victims side  vivid to me is leaving angola after the first visit and debbie asking what i thought and i said too fast i thought those were the nicest people i had ever met and the ironic laughter it provoked in us both the car yawing the obvious truth people are people equally the damage is never limited to perpetrator and victim also that the crimes are not the sum of the criminal any more than anyone is entirely separable from their acts  i remember an afternoon at the iron pile at transylvania watching the men quietly plait each others hair between sets at the weight bench when i asked about a man whose face was severely scarred a very specific face with large direct aquamarine eyes a guard told me that the mans brother had thrown a tire over his head and set it on fire this i did not know how to absorb it was a steaming day the men were lifting weights and plaiting their hair  i remember easter weekend at the womens prison the day before a long line formed outside the prisonrun beauty shop inside the women having their hair fixed were talking back to a soap opera on the small snowy screen by visiting day the inner courtyard had been transformed into a theme park for the children a trampoline had been rented a cottoncandy machine someone dressed in a bunny suit was organizing an egg hunt the girls wore starched flouncy dresses and the boys white jackets and black clipon bow ties the women were dressed up too even the ones shackled at ankle and waist deborah photographed all day nonstop identifiable pictures of children would have to be excluded from publication but people wanted a keepsake we left before visiting hours ended it wasnt our place to be there it wasnt really in us to be there  remember sitting in the frigid holiday inn bar near st gabriel at the end of one visit to the womens prison staring at the aquarium not talking  talking to a man who says he has done a lot of time lot of time he should write a book he says he wants to be a success hollywood huh here i come  talking to a woman who says the one time her dad visited her from the midwest she asked him to look at her eyes there was a look she didnt want to get a faraway look her father pretended to examine her eyes then told her they looked like the same old peepers to him she passed her time reading same way she passed her childhood she thought she was going to be an astronomer when she grew up not a felon  both parents are dead now of her three sons one disappeared one died of suicide and the third severed contact  one of the inmates at st gabriel informed me she wouldnt be around for visiting hours tomorrow because she was on the drill team also her exhusband would not be bringing her baby boy to see her not tomorrow not ever  the grease burns i am told by another inmate are courtesy of her sister  dont walk on the grass says the sign posted in the inner yard  then theres the bus that leaves from monroe taking visitors to one of four neighboring pens al derrys prison transport and popcorn balls evidently the popcorn balls make it the competitive ride only in louisiana  after a time a lot of time they stop coming the freeworlders they are too poor or too busy working or are already looking after others on the outside or their car is broken or they are too worn down or they move too far off or they get old sick and die so the inmates wait for their turn  they arent going anywhere they have all the time there is  the only continuity of our lives wrote malcolm braly american writer american lifer was that we had none  waiting goes the motto at st gabriel its the lciw way  i wrote a woman and asked whether she ever had any pets she wrote back bandit baby snobby elsie bear those were the dogs tiger and fuzzball the cats jill ben and junior the coons and a lot of unnamed fish hamsters rabbits chickens ducks geese guinea pigs and a deer not really a pet but i finally coaxed to the point she would eat out of my hand  not to idealize not to judge not to exonerate not to aestheticize immeasurable levels of pain not to demonize not anathematize what i wanted was to unequivocally lay out the real feel of hard time i wanted it given to understand that when you pass four prisons in less than an hour the countrysides apparent emptiness is more legible it is an open running comment when the only spike in employment statistics is being created by the supply of people crossing the line  i wanted the banter the idiom the softspoken cadence of louisiana speech to cut through the massmedia myopia i wanted the heat the humidity the fecundity of louisiana to travel right up the body what i wanted was to convey the sense of normalcy for which humans strive under conditions that are anything but what we in the free world call normal no matter what we may have done for which we were never charged  the world of the prison system springs up adjacent to the free world as the towns decline the prisons grow as industries disappear prisons proliferate statefunded prisonbuilding surges are complemented by privateinvestment promising to be an integral component of your corrections strategy according to an industry founder the interrelation of poverty illiteracy substance and physical abuse mental illness race and gender to the prison population is blaring to the naked eye and borne out by the statistics of the developed nations only russia aspires to our rate of incarceration and the big bear is a distant second ladies and gentlemen of the jury the warp in the mirror is of our making  the popular perception is that art is apart i insist it is a part of something not in dispute is that people in prison are apart from if you can acceptwhatever level of discipline and punishment you adhere to momentarily set asidethat the ultimate goal should be to reunite the separated with the larger human enterprise it might behoove us to see prisoners among others as they elect to be seen in their larger selves if we go there if not with our bodies then at least our minds we are more likely to register the implications      i am going to prison i am going to visit three prisons in louisiana i am going on the heels of my longtime friend deborah luster a photographer it is a summons all roads are turning into prison roads i already feel guilty i havent done anything but i allow the mental pull in both directions i am going to prison in order to write about it like a nineteenthcentury traveler kafka put it this way guilt is never to be doubted also behind every anonymous number a very specific face also there are more than two million individuals in this country whose sentences have rendered them more or less invisible many of them permanently first to transylvania then angola then st gabriel these are their placenames over the next year and a half deborah luster will photograph upwards of 1500 inmates i will make three trips it is an almost imperceptible gesture a flick of the conscience to go to see but i will be wakeful it is a summons

 kathleen eileen already i am no longer looked at with lechery or love my daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls are gone from the house my husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite and night is night  it is a real chill out the genuine thing i am not deceived i do not think it is still summer because sun stays and birds continue to sing  it is summergone that i see it is summergone the sweet flowers indrying and dying down the grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown  it is a real chill out the fall crisp comes i am aware there is winter to heed there is no warm house that is fitted with my need i am cold in this cold house this house whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls i am a woman and dusty standing among new affairs i am a woman who hurries through her prayers  tin intimations of a quiet core to be my desert and my dear relief come there shall be such islanding from grief and small communion with the master shore twang they and i incline this ear to tin consult a dual dilemma whether to dry in humming pallor or to leap and die  somebody muffed it somebody wanted to joke

 it was the time before i was born i was thin i was hungry i was only a restlessness inside a woman’s body  above us lightning split open the sky below us wagon wheels cut land in two around us were the soldiers young and afraid who did not trust us with scissors or knives but with needles  tear dresses they were called because settler cotton was torn in straight lines like the roads we had to follow to oklahoma  but when the cloth was torn it was like tears impossible to hold back and so they were called by this other name for our weeping  i remember the women tonight they walk out from the shadows with black dogs children the dark heavy horses and wornout men  they walk inside me this blood is a map of the road between us i am why they survived the world behind them did not close the world before them is still open all around me are my ancestors my unborn children i am the tear between them and both sides live

 1  it unfolds and ripples like a banner downward  all the stories come folding out  the smells and flowers begin to come back as the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded  rabbits and violets  who asked you to come over  she got her foot in the door and would not remove it elbowing and talking swiftly  gas leak that sounds like a very existential position perhaps you had better check with the landlord  this was no better than the predicament i had just read about  now it was actually changing before my eyes  sometimes it will come to a standstill though and finally the reflection can begin  selflessthat was the proposition  smiling and moving instantly there was no other purpose than that which brought them there to be in a particular place   2  this time the mule gave its face away  take your cadillac where you want to go in the morning convertible as it might be and enjoy a good bottle of rum  running on this way she used various modes of expression that were current  nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer what woods she was questioned realizing that as far as the woods went they were largely inhabitable through the facility of her mind  at the philadelphia flower show an ideal situation was built up  here through various regulated artificial conditions spring grass waterfalls the newlysprouted bulbs completed her ideal concept of nature  the smell was overpowering  all right then  she had a thing about nature from flower show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated  a beauty of cultivationin living  hastiness did not prevent her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd conclusions throwing the telephone book to the floor “oh oh the life i am entangled in”  four sides of it  above was a paradisical level incompleted  with working possibilities  below endless preoccupations and variations were possible currently in vogue were shelves the vacuum cleaner a new bedspread and color scheme for pillows  taste treats were unresponsive  glamor do’s were out  conversation was nil languid  she could not even find a place to languish upon that was fulfilling in its own way  so out of the lifelessness that was around her the grape leaves drying out and even though the avocado was sprouting  she thought why not fantasy  tugging at this character and that trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer a half blind bat dryad the works of the story teller  here the four walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again  “i ought to tighten down and make sure i say exactly what i mean”  and her face took on a tight pinched expression and thrifty scotch economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way  use every tidbitusefully  once upon a time there was a princess who had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar and inside the coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors the princess languished  she was not sure where to sit to her best advantage to enjoy herself the most  she could not go in her mind or out  she looked at her long white hand i am the queen of the high mountain hag she murmured to herself still knowing she was a princess  she lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of eden the coat spread around her  no that poor little house she had built was a bore  it’s better that it go up in flames as it did  she went down to grand central station and gave away flowers some people took them and some people didn’t   3  i’m glad to get back  i had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey questioning myself all along the way  was i jumping on her because her time had come to an end  indeed i pounded on his arm all night over his concern for this softspoken individual i can see nothing but their softness  me me and the time we might spend together reading and talking to tear away that putrid husk  my flippancy is gone  now i have started my secret life again in transition reminding  as the moth reminds its feeble antenna groping taken like a stalk of fern coins of money  all over i was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent it was a cold night out  it was colder still between the airy gaps between blankets  you can see she is thoughtful as she draws the string to the bow  where to go indeed  the point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly  a sleeping angel or a sleeping troll  i was rather proud of being used pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown street  here pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations drawing from their bags long lists of memorandum due what i owed it was a lot if i hesitated  i choose to go on saying this is the way i go owing nothing being that kind of person  hung up  that thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly marked  certainly one supposes in all honesty that an essential core of feeling blooms in each encounter  lost under the weight of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent thus unhappy i don’t want it to be this way and so forth not costumes or paraphernalia the immediate reactions   4  we of course are in a family situation  anything i wish might happen but the larger situations are not real not to be considered possible discussable as to what sense of reality they possessed  in the snow the wood piled up underneath  oh those drifting sensibilities  at this point it is scarcely believable that people gather and like each other  eating chocolate pudding getting in touch with some other sense of alikeness  the form is no longer obvious to me  whether they meander or are joined together in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along  i suspect that in this house this place that is musty and left as it was some years ago there is no real fear the objects are old and i am not familiar with them only the sense that the ghost or spirit world strikes you with its familiarity pleasurable fear  here the familiar is apt to make its presence known at any moment the unexpected lurk in the hall into the room  pieces of leather old silken fans laid upon the table top rooms filled with something left unexpectedly terror is the wrong combination of ignorance  it contains its own self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe  100 pieces of voice with no name called it myself as they spoke all day sucking the soft slush admitting their real deficiencies as i am never sure oh it’s that power  and disease of believing in the stale that doesn’t demand a real climate takes its capacity when the demons come down   5  the night passes in night time  the head moving to the shoulder the head rising with a frown  in a firm voice it doesn’t matter if the hair is flying from undue spring breezes the self has been raptured on the wine that produces appropriate madness and sad she says my dear the bacchanal is a lovely way to be rid of waste  however in seeing the house more manageable one cannot even have fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which refuses to sink  there once was a woman who grew older not that she minded but the passage of time was always constant  why does one have to contend with that she said puzzled as she got carried along and constantly had to think up new coping modes of behavior  if he behaved to me thus when he was 40 now that i am 30 i can hardly behave like that to those that are 20 and so forth  there wasn’t any model except the one she built and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern  this offered wonderful possibilities but also indecision and gutlessness   6  you can’t see them all bundled up all those that choose to move other than where the distance seems appealing  knowledge has no depth  there isn’t any message to be spoken  wrangling she speaks illadvised my dear as the cat has no point in laying its head down  she ought to watch carefully  the claws  it could be the bent hands as they grow that as the fur impeaches the rose doesn’t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer what could it be all about  the necessity to follow balancing contemplating words as the basis of why we move at all  just a little touch  the leader cautioned further progression i could hardly listen to the music for long  now there seemed to be interruptions pleasurable interludes nothing definite of a fragmented nature  certainly i wished the best for all  the sadder soldiers stumbled idly as i also in the profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns the twisting statements grooving into the language building something to listen to  the dress made from silk  trusting was awkward and not of a nature to ease any further building  whosoever you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of communication   7  i am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort  however as dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas how did those arise from a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund  knowledge comes from what purported strike  from that which cleanses and let us knot say “heart” but tissue  hopefully and helpfully i have built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep  not for purposes of letting in the cold  however i have found that not all blockaded against is the cold the dreary reign of the dead etc and tasteless realm of the mushroom  as much can be denied as the bilious sun strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and the head  that is uncorraled ecstasy  i call it enthusiasm free energy but it has no place to land it is bursting and unfocused it is a real force and the counterpart of the gloomy depths  as the pieces of the house ooze sap blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks  whether or not to join in what i was half committed to see and do   8  at this point when jack picked up the pussy willow branches i said they can’t possibly be ours for the taking and smiled with dedication to an older con edison man  the buildings were like the unexplored garbage in my mind fascinating and dirty pulling pieces of cloth from boxes left overnight  energy as limitless possibility in the attempt to transmit nonenergy situations  for example if once i stop to realize what little gets through i am much more interested in the cover than the contents it is difficult to find any interest in anything  good energy displaces bad karma and other non entities like that sort producing flow that in its own place has a good bed stocked well with what can be called fleetfooted fishes and approaching places of investigation such as relations between  as i saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin i forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from something i have never seen more possibly the components of what every man views  if this was a possibility the rays from every person converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without any mind at all for this horror fits the cat on the stairs between the fifth and sixth rung  this is the way people glow and pulse similar to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way full of human life until i who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be blocked on the way although i turn back gladly and will again swim through for it is possible they do not kill the sting’s compounded measure is fear and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition or orifices stomachs and legs  i reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing themselves  she ignored her face blotched and red upon times but fuller  did you forget to wax and wane  her head was full of energy brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious into color but no sense  sense was for the thinkers  here the thinkers forgot their word orders or sense it was better to give them coffee and those off worse could smoke  i had felt very foolish when i leaned forward and grasped his hand with effort and his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted which is the way  and i followed for certainly no one would follow me  as the day is cold and colder and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and nature  these words like nature and head thinking and words repeat themselves as the lines of landscape attics and other closedoff sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition  light  was such an enormous possibility  taking sight into a frenzy it was possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder for ages at a time things appeared as beautiful the sky the street where cars had gone by  i worried about certain characters ones that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but i was drawn to them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding as when the mysteries were performed the house then itself became distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled with the stuff of continuity  the sorrow that each day sinks into the infertile other side of day where voice comes out of the dark and does its rituals  memory has its own screen across the room to view itself and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form in stifflegged walks to remind thus on and on the breathing goes    new york january – march 1967

 you are as even tempered as a frying pan in a sudden downpour a campsite in disarray a long time coming laughter from two yards over the neighborhood a claim on space involving multiple parties  it must be father’s day judging by the heightened attentions of daughters and sons thus a man enjoys solitude stillness pink petals of the carrier rose and in a certain light the sonic continuum of tires against the road the sensation of being carried along toward the end of a sentence after the disappearance of the period  air to breathe water to drink the suggestion box is empty obsolete equipment piles up in nooks and crannies this is all wrong that’s messed up we go on in and make ourselves comfortable the movie has just begun it’s nick and nora charles and their little dog asta  they’re visiting nick’s parents in the suburbs he’s on the wagon and trying to keep a low profile but of course she brags about him to the local paper and soon he’s embroiled in detective work despite himself there is crime everywhere even here in the suburbs it must be human nature desperate characters on the loose  “yoke yourself to your strongest conviction” was a piece of advice derived from the y in joy but pam doesn’t buy that and i say it sounds too slavish remember the groucho line “these are my principles if you don’t like them i have others”  when the pen runs out of ink you simply replace the cartridge and continue writing to the sound of jet planes overhead it’s time to revive the typewriter for the benefit of kids now entering the ranks of the scribe force  sliding the paper under the roller striking the surface with heavy metal blows history curls right into the future a möbius strip that brings bygone media around and back with all the drama character sound light and destiny alive in an imagination of living

 addressed to charles lamb of the india house london well they are gone and here must i remain this limetree bower my prison i have lost beauties and feelings such as would have been most sweet to my remembrance even when age had dimmd mine eyes to blindness they meanwhile friends whom i never more may meet again on springy heath along the hilltop edge wander in gladness and wind down perchance to that still roaring dell of which i told the roaring dell oerwooded narrow deep and only speckled by the midday sun where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock flings arching like a bridgethat branchless ash unsunnd and damp whose few poor yellow leaves neer tremble in the gale yet tremble still fannd by the waterfall and there my friends behold the dark green file of long lank weeds that all at once a most fantastic sight still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge of the blue claystone  now my friends emerge beneath the wide wide heavenand view again the manysteepled tract magnificent of hilly fields and meadows and the sea with some fair bark perhaps whose sails light up the slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two isles of purple shadow yes they wander on in gladness all but thou methinks most glad my gentlehearted charles for thou hast pined and hungerd after nature many a year in the great city pent winning thy way with sad yet patient soul through evil and pain and strange calamity ah slowly sink behind the western ridge thou glorious sun shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb ye purple heathflowers richlier burn ye clouds live in the yellow light ye distant groves and kindle thou blue ocean so my friend struck with deep joy may stand as i have stood silent with swimming sense yea gazing round on the wide landscape gaze till all doth seem less gross than bodily and of such hues as veil the almighty spirit when yet he makes spirits perceive his presence  a delight comes sudden on my heart and i am glad as i myself were there nor in this bower this little limetree bower have i not markd much that has soothd me pale beneath the blaze hung the transparent foliage and i watchd some broad and sunny leaf and lovd to see the shadow of the leaf and stem above dappling its sunshine and that walnuttree was richly tingd and a deep radiance lay full on the ancient ivy which usurps those fronting elms and now with blackest mass makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue through the late twilight and though now the bat wheels silent by and not a swallow twitters yet still the solitary humblebee sings in the beanflower henceforth i shall know that nature neer deserts the wise and pure no plot so narrow be but nature there no waste so vacant but may well employ each faculty of sense and keep the heart awake to love and beauty and sometimes tis well to be bereft of promisd good that we may lift the soul and contemplate with lively joy the joys we cannot share my gentlehearted charles when the last rook beat its straight path along the dusky air homewards i blest it deeming its black wing now a dim speck now vanishing in light had crossd the mighty orbs dilated glory while thou stoodst gazing or when all was still flew creeking oer thy head and had a charm for thee my gentlehearted charles to whom no sound is dissonant which tells of life

time has no mercy it’s there it stays still or it moves and you’re there with it staying still or moving with it i think it moves and we move with it and keep moving  eleven years old and soon to be in fifth grade that’s time boys’ time who knows what time it is but them eternally no one knows time better than they always and forever  our family mama me angie gilbert earl louise kids daddy working in skull valley for the atampsf ry mama just packed us up in new mexico and moved us  suddenly a surprise to me anyway to join daddy who was away most of the time arizona california sometimes colorado sometimes texas always away  railroad work labor heavy machinery rails and sun trains always moving i remember the war the 1940s soldiers tanks cannons with huge guns and wheels  time does have mercy but it doesn’t enumerate or wait it moves and we move with it though for boys maybe i wanted to wait so things could happen more gently  a boy misses his father a boy watches younger sisters and younger brothers all growing and he’s growing and he misses the times his mother is happy laughing  who knows time as well as boys and their young worries i was a boy growing within a family community and dreams and girls girl teenagers i adored them their pretty ways  in the fourth grade at mccartys made a bookshelf in shop proudly sanded varnished shiny for my mama with love i wanted to be a good carpenter like my dad  dad drank though dark moods dark scary times danger and words hurtful abrasive accusing anger pain scorn a boy wonders about time about forever when it ends  i loved my dad wonderful skilled man artist singer precious and assuring yet yet unpredictable moments you can never tell about time either like that it is it is  we farmed corn melons chili beets carrots cilantro onions even potatoes in little mounds but they died corn fields at night irrigating june nights i loved forever  my grandpa i loved very much time was soothing then we didn’t really need time when days and nights were safe and with him they were a healer and respected kiva elder  herded his sheep along with my uncle estevan and roy roy was a strange one chinese manner so people said from chinatown in california he had a gentle soft smile  and a storyteller he was yes about his horse lightning fast and nimble and quick lightning his horse he’d ride yes ride to see his girl to call her outside estella estella  stories i’d listen the boy i was seeing my uncle riding riding his fast and nimble horse i’d listen and he’d smile memory and time it doesn’t count all the time listening  and because mothers are always loving alert ever caring mama decided we must go to skull valley where dad was up to grants the depot there we got on the westbound train  sacks and boxes a trunk suitcase or two clothes things what did we have i don’t remember not much though we never had much poor and lonely for dad always away  i wonder i wonder too often that’s been the indian story father gone mother and kids left behind is it like that yes too much dad didn’t like working for the hard railroad  he’d complain and rant about the crude and mean whites the slave rules the company trains powerful unending time i thought was in the trains fast loud dangerous  i was afraid of the powerful trains like i said i’d see them soldiers army troop trains going east and going west unending i wondered where they were all going where  lightning and thunder trapped in the train power and steel yet i yearned for blue song hollow and lonely long tone coming round the bend and something beyond the horizon  far away maybe travel some other dream youth yes i liked songs music i heard on the radio hank williams and stories that rang through the air talk and listening  it was the first time ever we were leaving the reservation only one world till then it seemed acoma community ours on the edge of another world though something strange  and fearful too the dark moments like when daddy drank when there was fire from another world an unknown yet fascinating somehow oddly something on the far horizon  i didn’t remember riding the train before ever until then like riding thunder the horse lightning roy talked about riding off somewhere into the dark night fast fast fast  riding toward night we watched the land speeding away far across the land along the edge of it was a highway with cars and trucks moving moving only slower  time speeds like you speed only not an awareness or any way to tell what is taking place when young and you’re trying to furnish your own answers solutions  to mysteries you’re anxious about when all’s uncertain youth is not the time when time is apparent too slow or too fast and you don’t really have clear reasons yet  at ashfork we got off the train onto the depot platform i sensed being lost lost mother and lost children dusk where was this world where did home go children  lost at the edge of a strange world with a gray green depot large letters painted little sister is hungry she whimpers mama says “hold my hand” we walk up street walk walk  it could be indians a family mother and children lost where are they going up the street i think looking for something to eat my mother held only a little money  hamburgers we split water and water selfconscious moment is time i looked out and saw a train passing our train i thought it was our train but it wasn’t just fear  wait then a train down chino valley longdistance night stars vanished in too much night long day into night where does time go does it go nowhere but into night  then at the sudden edge the horizon a vast bowl of light and only at the far end trees and still far ahead of us the train engine light always a light showing the way  my brother and i excited a deer stunned by train light stilled stark a cut stone the dazzling moment held us youth and time nothing like it thrilled never until then  years later i tried to tell about that moment to a love but love is time too so can’t do anything but live time the horizon and beyond full of stars even unseen  always belief is firmer than faith with and without dreams we arrived in skull valley early in the morning threethirty where were we on the other side of the moon from acoma  a mother and her children and assorted bags and boxes dreams time horizon farther from home than belief it felt like that within moment when you can’t turn away  a train depot on the other side of the moon deserted after the train pulled away only the rails and starshine what’s a boy say to his mother earlier than anything  a man whose picture i’d seen white man with a cap with a visor sitting at a tall wooden desk with shelves and a metal puzzle thing making clickingclacking noises  who spoke with mama who smiled who wondered at us an indian woman with indian children who were strangers like we just came from the planet acoma the other side  of day of the present early morning night in that moment the telegrapher with the visor said i think i think he did he knew my father knew where he lived two miles away  so we took a road early early morning night trek time shimmers in an odd amazing way within what might be a boy and a story the dawn coming horizon ever so near  when we knocked on his railroad worker housing door daddy was shocked in his underwear shadows upon and the background of his and mama’s and our history  we come to discover each other all failures and gains counting and mattering no matter the time or sequence we laugh and hug and cry daddy daddy we’re here  once again together family history travel time love to say what time is even fifty years in the past to now in this moment skull valley is just as real as it ever was  memory we cross and cross again treks trauma and on we do know what time is it is loss and gain a lingering within discovery we come to ourselves finding destiny  moments recalled like friends it was that way or another we’re fairly certain either way stories they are with us time doesn’t forsake it doesn’t soothe or decrease never  skull valley a time for a boy history engulfed beyond when i went back recently i ate with friends at the cafe by the railroad track i was fascinated by photographs  of the mountain lions in the mountains nearby ever there no matter what and the stories of bones tall tales or truths they’re told apaches it’s said wagon trains lies or no  our history is more than here we know more than realize we realize what we don’t know or want to know truths stalk us just like they found a boy more than fifty years ago  he discovered a world beyond acoma a world apart and a world together as time memory as story as his own we seek and are found secure actual safe and serene  last summer near prescott that boy fifty vast years later found carved images on stone walls that fit his hands carved in time eternal as stone past and present ever  let’s say it is ever an ongoing story

 what crowding thoughts around me wake what marvels in a christmascake ah say what strange enchantment dwells enclosed within its odorous cells is there no small magician bound encrusted in its snowy round for magic surely lurks in this a cake that tells of vanished bliss a cake that conjures up to view the early scenes when life was new when memory knew no sorrows past and hope believed in joys that last  mysterious cake whose folds contain life’s calendar of bliss and pain that speaks of friends for ever fled and wakes the tears i love to shed oft shall i breathe her cherished name from whose fair hand the offering came for she recalls the artless smile of nymphs that deck my native isle of beauty that we love to trace allied with tender modest grace of those who while abroad they roam retain each charm that gladdens home and whose dear friendships can impart a christmas banquet for the heart

 to one who has been long in city pent tis very sweet to look into the fair and open face of heavento breathe a prayer full in the smile of the blue firmament who is more happy when with hearts content fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair of wavy grass and reads a debonair and gentle tale of love and languishment returning home at evening with an ear catching the notes of philomelan eye watching the sailing cloudlets bright career he mourns that day so soon has glided by een like the passage of an angels tear that falls through the clear ether silently

 farewell too little and too lately known whom i began to think and call my own for sure our souls were near allyd and thine cast in the same poetic mould with mine one common note on either lyre did strike and knaves and fools we both abhorrd alike to the same goal did both our studies drive the last set out the soonest did arrive thus nisus fell upon the slippery place while his young friend performd and won the race o early ripe to thy abundant store what could advancing age have added more it might what nature never gives the young have taught the numbers of thy native tongue but satire needs not those and wit will shine through the harsh cadence of a rugged line a noble error and but seldom made when poets are by too much force betrayd thy generous fruits though gatherd ere their prime still showd a quickness and maturing time but mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme once more hail and farewell farewell thou young but ah too short marcellus of our tongue thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound but fate and gloomy night encompass thee around

 i  calm was the sea to which your course you kept oh how much calmer than all southern seas many your nameless mates whom the keen breeze wafted from mothers that of old have wept all souls of children taken as they slept are your companions partners of your ease and the green souls of all these autumn trees are with you through the silent spaces swept your virgin body gave its gentle breath untainted to the gods why should we grieve but that we merit not your holy death we shall not loiter long your friends and i living you made it goodlier to live dead you will make it easier to die  ii  with you a part of me hath passed away for in the peopled forest of my mind a tree made leafless by this wintry wind shall never don again its green array chapel and fireside country road and bay have something of their friendliness resigned another if i would i could not find and i am grown much older in a day but yet i treasure in my memory your gift of charity your mellow ease and the dear honour of your amity for these once mine my life is rich with these and i scarce know which part may greater be what i keep of you or you rob of me  iii  your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight until a kinder wind unfurl her sail your docile spirit wingèd by this gale hath at the dawning fled into the light and i half know why heaven deemed it right your youth and this my joy in youth should fail god hath them still for ever they avail eternity hath borrowed that delight for long ago i taught my thoughts to run where all the great things live that lived of yore and in eternal quiet float and soar there all my loves are gathered into one where change is not nor parting any more nor revolution of the moon and sun  iv  in my deep heart these chimes would still have rung to toll your passing had you not been dead for time a sadder mask than death may spread over the face that ever should be young the bough that falls with all its trophies hung falls not too soon but lays its flowercrowned head most royal in the dust with no leaf shed unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung and though the after world will never hear the happy name of one so gently true nor chronicles write large this fatal year yet we who loved you though we be but few keep you in whatsoe’er is good and rear in our weak virtues monuments to you

 i leave you in your garden in the yard behind it run the airedales you have reared with boxer’s vigilance and poet’s rigour doggenerations you have trained the vigour that few can breed to train and fewer still control with the deliberate human will and in the house there rest piled shelf on shelf the accumulations that compose the self poem and history for if we use words to maintain the actions that we choose our words with slow defining influence stay to mark out our chosen lineaments  continual temptation waits on each to renounce his empire over thought and speech till he submit his passive faculties to evening come where no resistance is the unmotivated sadness of the air filling the human with his own despair where now lies power to hold the evening back implicit in the grey is total black denial of the discriminating brain brings the neurotic vision and the vein of necromancy all as relative for mind as for the sense we have to live in a halfworld not ours nor history’s and learn the false from halftrue premisses  but sitting in the duskthough shapes combine vague mass replacing edge and flickering line you keep both rule and energy in view much power in each most in the balanced two ferocity existing in the fence built by an exercised intelligence though night is always close complete negation ready to drop on wisdom and emotion night from the air or the carnivorous breath still it is right to know the force of death and as you do persistent tough in will raise from the excellent the better still

 to the memory of a friend  drowned off water island april 1960 finally from your house there is no view the bay’s blind mirror shattered over you and patchogue took your body like a log the wind rolled up to shore the senseless drowned have faces nobody would care to see but water loves those gradual erasures of flesh and shoreline greenery and glass and you belonged to water it to you having built on a hillock above the bay your house the bay giving you reason to where now if seasons still are running straight the horseshoe crabs clank armor night and day their couplings far more ancient than the eyes that watched them from your porch i saw one once whose back was a history of how we live grown onto every inch of plate except where the hinges let it move were living things barnacles mussels water weedsand one blue bit of polished glass glued there by time the origins of art it carried them with pride it seemed as if endurance only matters in the end or so i thought  skimming traffic lights starboard and port steer through planted poles that mark the way and other lights across the bay faint stars lining the border of long island’s shore come on at night they still come on at night though who can see them now i do not know wild roses at your back porch break their blood and bud to test surprises of sea air and the birds fly over gliding down to feed at the two feeding stations you set out with seed or splash themselves in a big bowl of rain you used to fill with water going across that night too fast too dark no one will know maybe you heard the last you’ll ever hear the cry of the savage and endemic gull which shakes the blood and always brings to mind the thought that death the scavenger is blind blunders and is stupid and the end comes with ironies so fine the seed falters in the marsh and the heron stops hunting in the weeds below your landing stairs standing in a stillness that now is yours

 an axe rang sharply ’mid those forest shades which from creation toward the skies had tower’d in unshorn beauty there with vigorous arm wrought a bold emigrant and by his side his little son with question and response beguiled the toil ‘boy thou hast never seen such glorious trees hark when their giant trunks fall how the firm earth groans rememberest thou the mighty river on whose breast we sail’d so many days on toward the setting sun our own connecticut compar’d to that was but a creeping stream’ ‘father the brook that by our door went singing where i launch’d my tiny boat with my young playmates round when school was o’er is dearer far to me than all these bold broad waters to my eye they are as strangers and those little trees my mother nutur’d in the garden bound of our first home from whence the fragrant peach hung in its ripening gold were fairer sure than this dark forest shutting out the day’ ‘what ho – my little girl’ and with light step a fairy creature hasted toward her sire and setting down the basket that contain’d his noonrepast look’d upward to his face with sweet confiding smile ‘see dearest see that brightwing’d paroquet and hear the song of yon gay redbird echoing through the trees making rich music didst thou ever hear in far new england such a mellow tone’ ‘i had a robin that did take the crumbs each night and morning and his chirping voice still made me joyful as i went to tend my snowdrops i was always laughing then in that first home i should be happier now methinks if i could find among these dells the same fresh violets’ slow night drew on and round the rude hut of the emigrant the wrathful spirit of the rising storm spake bitter things his weary children slept and he with head declin’d sat listening long to the swoln waters of the illinois dashing against their shores starting he spake ‘wife did i see thee brush away a tear ’twas even so thy heard was with the halls of thy nativity their sparkling lights carpets and sofas and admiring guests befit thee better than these rugged walls of shapeless logs and this lone hermit home’ ‘no – no all was so still around methought upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal which ’mid the church where erst we paid our vows so tuneful peal’d but tenderly thy voice dissolv’d the illusion’ and the gentle smile lighting her brow the fond caress that sooth’d her waking infant reassur’d his soul that wheresoe’er our best affections dwell and strike a healthful root is happiness content and placid to his rest he sank but dreams those wild magicians that do play such pranks when reason slumbers tireless wrought their will with him up rose the thronging mart of his own native city – roof and spire all glittering bright in fancy’s frostwork ray the steed his boyhood nurtur’d proudly neigh’d the favorite dog came frisking round his feet with shrill and joyous bark – familiar doors flew open – greeting hands with his were link’d in friendship’s grasp – he heard the keen debate from congregated haunts where mind with mind doth blend and brighten – and till morning rov’d ’mid the loved scenery of his native land

 what i would like to give them for a change is not the usual prescription with its hubris of the power to restore to cure what i would like to give them ill from not enough of laying in the sun not caring what the onlookers might think while feeding some banana to their dogs what i would like to offer them is this not reassurance that their lungs sound fine or that the mole they’ve noticed change is not a melanoma but instead of fear transfigured by some doctorly advice i’d like to give them my astonishment at sudden rainfall like the whole world weeping and how ridiculously gently it slicked down my hair i’d like to give them that the joy i felt while staring in your eyes as you learned epidemiology the science of disease in populations the night around our bed like timelessness like comfort like what i would give to them

 we stand in the rain in a long line waiting at ford highland park for work you know what work isif you’re old enough to read this you know what work is although you may not do it forget you this is about waiting shifting from one foot to another feeling the light rain falling like mist into your hair blurring your vision until you think you see your own brother ahead of you maybe ten places you rub your glasses with your fingers and of course it’s someone else’s brother narrower across the shoulders than yours but with the same sad slouch the grin that does not hide the stubbornness the sad refusal to give in to rain to the hours of wasted waiting to the knowledge that somewhere ahead a man is waiting who will say “no we’re not hiring today” for any reason he wants you love your brother now suddenly you can hardly stand the love flooding you for your brother who’s not beside you or behind or ahead because he’s home trying to sleep off a miserable night shift at cadillac so he can get up before noon to study his german works eight hours a night so he can sing wagner the opera you hate most the worst music ever invented how long has it been since you told him you loved him held his wide shoulders opened your eyes wide and said those words and maybe kissed his cheek you’ve never done something so simple so obvious not because you’re too young or too dumb not because you’re jealous or even mean or incapable of crying in the presence of another man no just because you don’t know what work is

 we would go down to the fish market early to cleanse our vision the fish were silver and scarlet and green and the color of sea the fish were lovelier than even the sea with its silvery scales we thought of return  lovely too the women with jars on their heads olivebrown clay shaped softly like thighs we each thought of our women their voices their laughs the way they walked down the street and each of us laughed and it rained on the sea  in vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth water softens the leaves and the grapestems the sky is colored by occasional clouds that redden with pleasure and sun on earth flavors and smells in the sky color and we were alone there  we thought of return the way a man thinks of morning after an utterly sleepless night we took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten of fruit all so alive in the musk of the sea we were drunk on the thought of impending return

 if light pours like water into the kitchen where i sway with my tired children  if the rug beneath us is woven with tough flowers and the yellow bowl on the table  rests with the sweet heft of fruit the sunwarmed plums if my body curves over the babies  and if i am singing then loneliness has lost its shape and this quiet is only quiet

 in the northwest corner of dakota i saw a room someone had left a plush sofa returning its button eyed stare to the glance she gave it over her shoulder the dog too turning in the next room the mattress with mattress stories one after another tumbling out of each spring the window she opened first thing its vista of mile after mile and the windmill hauling its load i saw that and nothing alive  green oilfigured linoleum laid on counters nails of bad craft the ripped blackening edge that scared her more than the bed and the sound of the windmill winning its will from the aquifer night after night the whack of her blade on the block there are houses with too many knives sometimes she said  but when june ferned its way in shed relent take on its restraint heave again on the stained sheets her burden of child herself a torn girl again combing her hair through fingers bruised by corn shocks sweet juice in the cuts of her life  she began to think of the border and mustangs without brand at night theyd bend over the bed and nuzzle one ride was enough she had sufficient magic to cling to a mane and fare over the windowsill i see where the curtain fell and nobody mended the tear i see where bare feet marked like fossils her pass in the rain  when he uncovers fiddleheads by the spring why does he always think of that first sight of her thigh in the peachcolored dress of his hands searching moss with its redgold stamens the spring in that arid landscape like something from canaan under his tongue even in old age hed ponder the moment lying under the moon forgiving himself her the world that bred their conundrum washed in that rain

you smoking  i left all my family  you were part of it  left california and reinvented myself even mythologized myself as a tan “california girl” you did not become an artist or a poet  i suppose that’s why you felt damaged if only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice it took for me to get away so many small things can save us from the damage you talked of for me drinking that first cup of orange pekoe and making tea my drink      risking rattlesnake poison with every steaming cup a tiny emblem of a rebellion i still try to practice  you left us so quickly marilyn and without any

with the colors but they never turned out so bright when coloring the eggs you the artist were interested in the designs to transfer onto the eggs cartoons bunnies chicks we kept our eggs separated from each other put them in separate bowls neither caring for the other’s creation still we felt connected even joyful on those few holiday projects  not enough to make us friends  my unwillingness to be like our classmates embarrassed you you chose invisibility in school rather than being known as “diane’s sister”  that unwillingness to be like others was what made me a poet so many little things but that early decision of yours not to understand why i wanted to be weird is what made you make so many other small choices preventing you from becoming an artist “look away” our mother said to us when there were ugly things confronting us i could not do that you blame our mother yet it was you who decided to look away even though it meant not seeing the whole world even if meant you didn’t become an artist poverty of course was the reason  we never had nice shoes   april 6  all numbers have disappeared instead there are mushrooms fungi that has always seemed more artful than tasty

heading “earl grey blends” this tea any cup of tea  hard to believe no sad to think my mother almost spat out her first taste of tea  what worldly thing must i touch to bring marilyn back into my sedate life my sister marilyn who died in january  her hand  i’d like to imagine timidly touching her hand  marilyn’s hand her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring in that hand she’d be holding a cigarette  smoke and fire makes me think of her  not water though it was that pacific ocean filled with seashells that she was in touch with my old hands not really like hers at all she had big hands for shaping things while mine are small      like birds

 my body laid out on a marble slab naked but for a linen sheet tucked under its chin as though to keep the patient warm  a solemn band approached identified the late departed with what looked like mingled relief mild satisfaction and bereavement  one of them took away an armthe right was itand loped off with a spring in his step which prompted others to do likewise here  a shoulder suitable for crying on there a foot there an eye and there an ear plump already one scooped out the belly  just who you’d imagine claimed the head not the one i hoped tugged loose a rib some by no means all i knew as friends  but felt no bitterness instead acceptance this while watching their several withdrawals travelers moving farther out and deeper  into the ringing distancewho all began to flourish somehow more intently themselves than they had earlier resolved to be  was glad of that despite a fit of shivers simple human nature still presiding when i took note of the rummage that remained  wishing a greener plot had been marked out for what had breathed with so much spark and promise my turn then to come forward for a closer  look and since no one else had carried off that steady flexibly strung pump at rest beneath the sternum take it for my own  sensing its mute but anchored trust that parts lucky for others would befriend as well oh love even the heir that flesh once named

 it was many and many a year ago in a kingdom by the sea that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of annabel lee and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me  i was a child and she was a child in this kingdom by the sea but we loved with a love that was more than love i and my annabel lee with a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven coveted her and me  and this was the reason that long ago in this kingdom by the sea a wind blew out of a cloud chilling my beautiful annabel lee so that her highborn kinsmen came and bore her away from me to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea  the angels not half so happy in heaven went envying her and me yesthat was the reason as all men know in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night chilling and killing my annabel lee  but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee  for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful annabel lee and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes of the beautiful annabel lee and so all the nighttide i lie down by the side of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride in her sepulchre there by the sea in her tomb by the sounding sea

 lately too much disturbed you stay trailing in me and i believe you how could i not feel you were misspent there by books stacked clean on glass or outside the snow arriving as i am still arriving if the explanations amount to something i will tell you it is enough you say that surfaces grow so distant maybe you darken already too much changed maybe in your house you would be content where no incident emerges but for smoke or glass or air such things held simply to be voiceless and if you mean me i believe you or if you should darken this inwardness would be misspent and flinching i might pause and add to these meager incidents the words some books should stay formal on the shelves so surely i heard you in your complication aware snow holding where it might weightless rest and should you fold into metrackless misspent too much arrangedi might believe you but swiftly shut lines of smoke rising through snow here where it seems no good word emerges though it is cold i am aware such reluctance could lose these blinking hours to simple safety here is an inwardless purpose in these hours when snow shuts it may be we empty amounting to something how could i not wait for those few words which we might enter

 where two streams joined we met by accident sitting upon an outcropping of rock with only the intent of watching water flow beneath unwinding water facing upstream she held a flower to the sun as i leaned back and found an arrowhead inside a crevice which lay there as if someone had left it by intent as an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water swirling upon stone and thus transform the accident of meeting her ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand into stark fact as obdurate as rock could i have called look at this arrowhead i just found here would she have thought an accident thats credible or feared that my intent was sinister and that the implication of the arrowhead unlike the radiant white flower or the two streams merging into faster water casting up colored spume had been contrived by me certain as rock that forms by geologic laws she had to know an arrowhead is humanly designed with the intent to kill though now its harmless as a flower decorating someones hair or water organized into a garden fountain an arrowhead can now be used as an adornment for a necklace like a flower in a painting where a stream leaps past a lightreflecting rock with nothing in a brushstroke left to accident and so our accidental meeting on the rock flowed by a flower cast upon the water with intent unknown and all thats left now is the arrowhead

 how do you explain why elephants appear to move their unwieldy hulks with greater dignity than most humans do in their finest moments as if they had evolved beyond wanting anything but what they have why does the field begin to ripple before the wind arrives in whispers as if there were a communication as if the landscape were poorly dubbed and we weren’t expected to notice what butterfly does not dart away from us as if it could sense our latent cruelties and yet return to check and doublecheck has the night not gotten recently darker as if to insinuate that we have squandered the light that was there have we made too much of our own and did you notice afterward the dawn opening up with a tentative eagerness as if there were something crucial to illumine as if we would wake up early just to see it i imagine you reading this now with an expression of quiet trouble itself troubled by currents of hope as if you imagined me here with you as if i might be able to see your expression and at least answer it with mine

 in siftings of chromatic sediment shed by the winter hours as they decay with slow descent light settles through the lower sky in peach then mauve then pale selfabnegating gray against the water now that day is spent at bennetts beach  under the high withdrawing blueness band on band like layers in a decorative bottle of sand enclosed beneath the heavens’ dome as though this were the perfect realm in which to live preserved unburdened by the least demand or wish to know  and simply be along the beach convene some silver gulls which stand around reﬂecting upon the sheen that comes and goes about their scarlet feet and crested terns ﬂy back and forth inspecting the shallows for a last titbit to glean and lightly treat  a twofaced wind that works its way across the metal of the sea it tries to planish and to emboss while deep in its unbalanced buffetings gannets alternately appear and vanish plunge rise and loft and give their heads a toss these things these things

 saturday i ran to mytilene  bushes and grass along the glassstill way were all dabbled with rain and the road reeled with shattered skies  towards noon an inky petulant wind ravelled the pools and rinsed the black grass round them  gulls were up in the late afternoon and the air gleamed and billowed and broadcast flung astringent spray all swordysilver i saw the hills lie brown and vast and passive  the men of mytilene waited restive until the yellow melt of sun i shouted out my news as i sped towards them that all rejoicing could go down to dark  all nests with all moist downy young blinking and gulping daylight and all lambs fourbraced in straw shivering and mild and the first bloodroot up from the ravaged beaches of the old equinox and frangible robins blue teethed right around to sun these first we loudly hymned and then the hour of genesis when the first moody firmament swam out of arctic chaos orbed solidly as the huge frame for this cramped little swaddled creatures coming forth to slowly foolishly marvellously discover a unique estate held wrapt away from all men else which to embrace our world would have to stretch and swell with strangeness  this made us smile and laugh at last there was rejoicing all night long in mytilene

 behind the fauverie a crawl of quayside traffic while aramis roars for his food the air turbulent as he opens his jaws in a huge yawn if i hold my breath halfclose my eyes and listen hard  there at the tongue’s root in the voicebox of night i might hear the almostvanished he’s summoning his prey this lord of thunderbolts calling to ghosts of the lost world with this evening chant to scarlet macaw tapir golden lion tamarin until everything goes slow and the rushhour queue of scaletoscale cars is one giant caiman basking on the bank the jaguar’s all swimming stealth now  no sound  a stalker camouflaged by floating hyacinths senses tuned only to the reptile of the road then with one bound spray scatters like glass as aramis lands on the brute’s back and bites its neck

 nobody in the lane and nothing nothing but blackberries blackberries on either side though on the right mainly a blackberry alley going down in hooks and a sea somewhere at the end of it heaving blackberries big as the ball of my thumb and dumb as eyes ebon in the hedges fat with bluered juices these they squander on my fingers i had not asked for such a blood sisterhood they must love me they accommodate themselves to my milkbottle flattening their sides  overhead go the choughs in black cacophonous flocks bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky theirs is the only voice protesting protesting i do not think the sea will appear at all the high green meadows are glowing as if lit from within i come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a chinese screen the honeyfeast of the berries has stunned them they believe in heaven one more hook and the berries and bushes end  the only thing to come now is the sea from between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me slapping its phantom laundry in my face these hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt i follow the sheep path between them a last hook brings me to the hills’ northern face and the face is orange rock that looks out on nothing nothing but a great space of white and pewter lights and a din like silversmiths beating and beating at an intractable metal

 you wouldnt have believed it how the man a little touched perhaps  set his hands together and prayed for happiness yet not his own  he meant his people by which he meant not people really but trees and cows  the dirty horses dogs the fox who lived at the back of his place with her kits  and the very night who settled down to rock his place to sleep the place  he tried so hard to tend he found he mended fences in his sleep  he said to the you above who lets be honest doesnt say too much  i need you now up there to give my people happiness you let  them smile and know the reason hear my prayer old yam the you whos you  might laugh at that and i agree its funny to make a prayer like that  the downhome words and yonder reach of what he said and calling god  the elder sweet potato shucks thats pretty funny and kind of sad

 you could drive blind for those two seconds and they would be forever i think that as a diesel truck passes us eight miles east of mission churning through the storm heedless of the hill sliding away there isn’t much use to curse but i do words fly away tumbling invisibly toward the unseen point where the prairie and sky meet the road is like that in those seconds nothing but the blind white side of creation  you’re there somewhere a tiny struggling cell you just might be significant but you might not be anything forever is a space of split time from which to recover after the mass passes my curse flies out there somewhere and then i send my prayer into the wake of the diesel truck headed for sioux falls one hundred and eighty miles through the storm

 ‘gabblegabble    brethren    gabblegabble’ my window frames forest and heather i hardly hear the tuneful babble not knowing nor much caring whether the text is praise or exhortation prayer or thanksgiving or damnation  outside it blows wetter and wetter the tossing trees never stay still i shift my elbows to catch better the full round sweep of heathered hill the tortured copse bends to and fro in silence like a shadowshow  the parson’s voice runs like a river over smooth rocks i like this church the pews are staid they never shiver they never bend or sway or lurch ‘prayer’ says the kind voice ‘is a chain that draws down grace from heaven again’  i add the hymns up over and over until there’s not the least mistake sevenseventyone look there’s a plover it’s gone who’s that saint by the lake the red light from his mantle passes across the broad memorial brasses  it’s pleasant here for dreams and thinking lolling and letting reason nod with ugly serious people linking sad prayers to a forgiving god     but a dumb blast sets the trees swaying with furious zeal like madmen praying

 a free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky  but a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing  the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom  the free bird thinks of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn and he names the sky his own  but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing  the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom

 after ian sanborn’s asl poem of the same title a man with eyes as blank as the indifference of nature is staring straight ahead as the whole thing unfolds he has a black beard black shirt black woolen cap  he could be a thief  you better keep your eyes on his hands which have begun clearing a clearing here he plants a seed as small as his own fingernail and shazam it sprouts roots shoots stems branches  a whole tree shouldering up tossing and swaying in the air between the sun’s magic hands and the man’s indifferent eyes next thing you know an orphan index finger is worming its way across the stage that wasn’t a stage until your eyeing it made it so it inches over to the tree like a lost knuckle finding its way home its feelers testing feeling sniffing finding purchase finding a toehold the tiny spiny hairy leglike appendages beginning to wiggle to climb to shinny up the tree the elbow the sheer escarpment pausing to send out a line a lasso a long rope as fine as the filament of a spider launched from its abdomen and hooking the thumb of the lowest branch a rope for rappelling for jumping off this cliff taking this dive twisting as it untwists enfolding as it unfolds holding on for dear life as it spins itself into silk those indifferent eyes almost imperceptibly squinting in sympathy with this closing up this cloaking this cloistering this hanging upside down with a pulse inside a fluttering pulse a pulse like the flutter of eyelids like the flutter of wings a heartbeat growing stronger stronger breaking out breaking free the wings opening the eyes opening as if all this time they were closed  the blank eyes opening to the wings taking them in incredulous in love with them  and the black and white has grown iridescent the orphaned knuckle has found the hands the hands have found their wings and we are all utterly blown away  ian sanborns asl poem may be viewed here

 they came like dewdrops overnight eating every plant in sight those nasty worms with legs that crawl so creepy up the garden wall green prickly fuzz to hurt and sting each unsuspecting living thing how i hate them   oh you know i’d love to squish them with my toe but then i see past their disguise someday they’ll all be butterflies

 holding only a handful of rushlight they pressed deeper into the dark at a crouch until the great rock chamber flowered around them and they stood in an enormous womb of flickering light and darklight a place to make a start raised hands cast flapping shadows over the sleeker shapes of radiance  theyve left the world of weather and panic behind them and gone on in drawing the dark in their wake pushing as one pulse to the core of stone the pigments mixed in big shells are crushed ore petals and pollens berries and the binding juices oozed out of chosen barks the beasts  begin to take shape from hands and feathertufts soaked in ochre manganese madder mallow white stroking the live rock letting slopes and contours mould those forms from chance coaxing rigid dips and folds and bulges to lend themselves to necks bellies swelling haunches a forehead or a twist of horn tails and manes curling to a crazy gallop  intent and human they attach the mineral vegetable animal realms to themselves inscribing the one unbroken line everything depends on from that impenetrable centre to the outer intangibles of light and air even the speed of the horse the bisons fear the arc of gentleness that this bigbellied cow arches over its spindling calf or the lancing dance of death that bristles out of the bucks struck flank on this one line they leave a beakheaded human figure of sticks and one small chalky human hand  well never know if they worked in silence like people prayingthe way our monks illuminated their own dark ages in crosshatched rocky cloisters where they contrived a binding labyrinth of lit affinities to spell out in natures lace and fable their mindful blinding sixth sense of a god of shadowsor whether like birds tracing their great bloodlines over the globe they kept a constant gossip up of praise encouragement complaint  it doesnt matter we know they went with guttering rushlight into the dark came to terms with the given world must have had as their hands moved steadily by spiderlightone desire wed recognise they wouldbefore going on beyond this border zone this nowhere that is now hereleave something upright and bright behind them in the dark

 once in late summer the road already deep in twilight mixing colors with some straggly wildflowers i came to a village i did not know was there until i stepped into its narrow street admiring the prim white houses nestled among their veteran lofty trees i found myself in a tiny square with a little dawdl ing fountain and a rickety tower its owlish clock absentmindedly counting minutes now and then  and in the fountain the face of morning seemed to linger as though searching the air was fresh breathing out the fragrances of a recent shower i luxuriated in my senses like meeting unexpectedly a pack of friends years and years unthought of laden with all kinds of gifts then as i stopped to knock at the door of a house that had seemed occupied with happy noises a silence fell on it the light went out and was it instant eyes like flakes ten thousand thousand flakes and all unknowing flurried round me wherever i turned i was met by the unmistakable accusation “stranger” i who had i thought begun here and who now required lodgings for the night was denied and from the start

 stripped to the waist hardmuscled downcast under the guns of lounging guards they are clearing a roadside across a palmetto landscape  i notice one blond boy swinging a pick broadshouldered   his skin is smooth bright sweaty his upright body ripples under the rigid fury of his face  his bulging eyes fixed on the ground can see mountains the destiny of his imagination he can never get to where he could rest a lion in the wilderness of his flesh  i see the body with its own career of gestures its bright roads its dark roads apart serene    men must be carved apparently like slaughtered steers or pigs to find the marble of their bones innocent innocent after all as the stones they break or rain or the guards in cages of their white voices  trapped in one chained line one terrifying combination of arrangements driven to taste each others flesh    the body sings alone among the earths arrangements ignorant of crimes or dreams or the curious idea of justice

 how should i now recall the icy lace of the pane like a sheet of cellophane or the skies of alcohol  poured over the saltbox town on that stony new england tableau the halo of falling snow glared like a waxy crown  through blue frozen lots my giant parents strolled wrapped tight against the cold like woolen argonauts  searching for that tall perfection of scotch pine from the hundreds laid in line like the dead at guadalcanal  the clapboard village aglow that starry stark december i barely now remember or the brutish ache of snow  burning my face like quicklime yet one thing was still missing i saw my parents kissing perhaps for the last time

 the dog and i push through the ring of dripping junipers to enter the open space high on the hill where i let him off the leash  he vaults snuffling between tufts of moss twigs snap beneath his weight he rolls and rubs his jowls on the aromatic earth his pink tongue lolls  i look for sticks of proper heft to throw for him while he sits prim and earnest in his love if it is love  all night a soaking rain and now the hill exhales relief and the fragrance of warm earth    the sedges have grown an inch since yesterday and ferns unfurled and even if they try the lilacs by the barn can’t keep from opening today  i longed for spring’s thousand tender greens and the whitethroated sparrow’s call that borders on rudeness do you know since you went away all i can do is wait for you to come back to me

 he gossips like my grandmother this man with my face and i could stand amused all afternoon in the hon kee grocery amid hanging meats he chops roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders her entire skin burnt crisp flesh i know to be sweet her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file each pierced by black hooks through breast bill and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass i step to the counter recite and he without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue scribbles my order on a greasy receipt and chops it up quick  such a sorrowful chinese face nomad gobi northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw he could be my brother but finer and except for his left forearm which is engorged sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a twopound tool hes delicate narrow waisted his frame so slight a lover some rough other might break it down its smooth oily length in his lighthanded calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness he is a southerner from a riverprovince suited for scholarship his face poised above an open book he’d mumble his favorite passages he could be my grandfather come to america to get a western education in 1917 but too homesick to study he sits in the park all day reading poems and writing letters to his mother  he lops the head off chops the neck of the duck into six slits the body open groin to breast and drains the scalding juices then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver old blade that has worn into the surface of the round footthick chopblock a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel  the head flung from the body opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes and i see foetalcrouched inside the skull the homunculus gray brain grainy to eat did this animal after all at the moment its neck broke image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death is this how i too recoil from my day see how this shape hordes itself see how little it is see its grease on the blade is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed when names are called when crimes are tallied this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open is this how i presided over my century is this how i regarded the murders this is also how i prayed was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed this too was how i slept clutching my wife was it me in the other i loved when i loved another the butcher sees me eye this delicacy with a finger he picks it out of the skullcradle and offers it to me i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down i eat my man  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of upanddown inandout a lump of muscle chugchugging blood into the ear a lover’s heartshaped tongue flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time an engine crossing recrossing salt water hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor these are the faces i love the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways at various times thirteen gathered around the redwood happy talkative voracious at day’s end eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands  brothers and sisters by blood and design who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes we constitute a manymembered body of love in a world of shapes of my desires each one here is a shape of one of my desires and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts the face the body that jut jaw to gnash tendon that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites those long eyes closing on the seen those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang these teeth to bite my monosyllables these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul puffed or sunken according to the life dark or light according to the birth straight or humped whole manqué quasi each pleases verging on utter grotesquery all are beautiful by variety the soul too is a debasement of a text but thus it acquires salience although a human salience but inimitable and hence memorable god is the text the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic  a bright moment i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty downcurved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to including me the eater whole unto itself complete without me yet its shape complements the shape of my mind i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me and i feel urged to utterance urged to read the body of the world urged to say it in human terms my reading a kind of eating my eating a kind of reading my saying a diminishment my noise a loveinanswer what is it in me would devour the world to utter it what is it in me will not let the world be would eat not just this fish but the one who killed it the butcher who cleaned it i would eat the way he squats the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish clubs it takes it to the sink guts it drops it on the weighing pan i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water that liquid violence between the man’s hands i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse i would eat it all to utter it the deaths at the sinks those bodies prepared for eating i would eat and the standing deaths at the counters in the aisles the walking deaths in the streets the deathfarfromhome the death inastrangeland these chinatown deaths these american deaths i would devour this race to sing it this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world

 1  the clouds part revealing a mythology of clouds assembled in light of earliest birds an originary text over water over time and that without which  the clouds part revealing an apology for clouds implicit in the air where the clouds had been recently witnessed rehearsing departure a heartfelt phrase  in the push of the airborne drops and crystals over water over timehow being made to think oneself an obstruction between the observer  and the object or objects under surveillance or even desiredor if i am felt to be beside the point then i have wanted that but to block a path is like  not being immaterial enough or being too much when all they want from you now is your station cleared of its personal effects please and vanish  not that they’d ever just come out and say it when all that darting around of the eyes all that shaky camouflage of paper could only portend the beginning of the  end of your tenure at this organization and remember a capacity to draw meaning out of such seeming accidence landed one here to begin with didn’t it   2  the clouds part revealing an anatomy of clouds viewed from the midst of human speculation a business project undertaken in a bid to acquire and retain  control of the formation and movement of clouds as late afternoons i have witnessed the distant towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun inbox  empty surround sound on all my money made in lieu of conversationwhere conversation indicates the presence of desire in the parties to embark on  exchange of spirit hours forzando with heartfelt phrase made metaphor for it the face on the clock tower bright as a meteor as if a torch were held against  likelihood to illuminate the time so i could watch the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury appointments of my office suite the tumult below  or behind me out of mind had not my whole attention been riveted by the human figure stood upon the tower’s topmost pinnacle himself surveying  the clouds of the future parting in antiquity a figure not to be mistaken tranquilly pacing a platform with authority the chief executive officer of clouds   3  the clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds built in glassfront factories carved into clifffaces which prior to the factories’ recent construction  provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons a species revered in ancient egypt as attendants of thoth god of wisdom science and measurement  fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts can be heard from up to a mile away depending on air temperature humidity the absence or presence  of any competing sound its origin and its character it is no more impossible to grasp the baboon’s full significance in egyptian religious symbolism  than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture provoke in an audience more positive lasting response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature  even those who consider natural clouds products of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely human mind lie behind the products they admire  this development may be a form of selfexalting or else another adaptation in order that we find the hum of machinery comforting through darkness   4  the clouds part revealing there’s no place left to sit myself down except for a single wingback chair backed into a corner to face the window in which  the clouds part revealing the insouciance of clouds cavorting over the backs of the people in the field who cut the ripened barley who gather it in sheaves  who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently  palmfanned air whose steady current carries off the chaff as the grain falls to the floor who collect the grain from the floor painstakingly to grind it  into flour who bake the flour into loaves the priest will offer in the sanctuary its walls washed white like milk to perform it repeatedly to perform it each time  as if the first to walk the dim corridor believing that the conference it leads to might change everything to adhere to a possibility of reward of betterment  of moving above with effort the condition into which one has been born to whom do i owe the pleasure of the hum to which i have been listening too long   5  the clouds part revealing the advocates of clouds believers in people ideas and things the workers of the united fields of clouds supporters of the wars  to keep clouds safe the devotees of heartfelt phrase and belief you can change with water over time it is the habit of a settled population to give ear to  whatever is desirable will come to pass a caressing confidencebut one unfortunately not borne out by human experience for most things people desire  have been desired ardently for thousands of years and observethey are no closer to realization today than in ramses’ time nor is there cause to believe  they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow attempts to speed them on have been undertaken from the beginning plans to force them overnight  are in copious antagonistic operation today and yet they have thoroughly eluded us and chances are they will continue to elude us until the clouds part  in a flash of autonomous ardent local brainwork but when the clouds start to knit back together again we’ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission   6  the clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies united into one immaterial body a fictive person around whom the air is blurred with money force  from which much harm will come to whom my welfare matters nothing i sense without turning the light from their wings their eyes they preen themselves  on the fire escape the windowsill their pink feet vulnerablea mistake to think of them that way if i turn around the room might not be full of wings  capable of acting in many respects as a single being which is to say that i myself may be the source of what i sense but am no less powerless to change it  always around me on my body in my mouth i fear them and their love of money everything i do without thinking to help them make it and if i am felt to be  beside the point i have wanted that to live apart from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep itself alive and yet not happily with all its needs  and comforts met but fattened so far past that point i am engrossed and if i picture myself outside of it it isn’t me anymore but a parasite cast out inviable   7  the clouds part revealing the distinction between words without meaning and meaning without words a phenomenon of nature the westbound field  of low air pressure developing over water over time and warm saturated air on the sea surface rising steadily replaced by cold air from above the cycle  repeating the warm moving upward into massive thunderclouds the cold descending into the eye around which bands of thunderclouds spiral counter  clockwise often in the hundreds the atmospheric pressure dropping even further making winds accelerate the clouds revolve a confusion of energy  an incomprehensible volume of raini remember the trick of thinking through infinity a crowd of eyes against an asphalt wall my vision of it scrolling  left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then just black until i fall asleep and then just black again past marketing past focus groups past human  resources past management past personal effects their insignificance evident in the eye of the dream and through much of the debriefing i wake into next

 after bitter resistance the river unravels into the night he says washes our daily fare of war out into a dark so deaf so almost without dimension there is no word to dive from body weight displaced by dreams whose own lack promises lucidity so powerful it could shoot a long take to mindlessness fish smell travels the regions of sleep westward like young men and the dawn then i return too early to bring anything back unsure of what i want terrified i’ll fail by a hair to seize it   we talk because we can forget she says our bodies open to the dark and sand runs out oblivion takes it all with equal tenderness as the sea does as the past already it suffuses the present with more inclusive tonalities not orchestrating a melodic sequence but rounding the memory of a rooster on top a hanging silence or injured flesh impersonal only an animal could be so   an avatar of the holy ghost he chuckles or the angel of the annunciation beating his wings against a door slammed shut behind it love already plays the organ without the angel he is invisible because we have rejected his message   on the old photos she says i see a stranger staking out my skin as if an apple could fall too far from the tree yet i call her “me” “my” years of furtively expanding flesh with almostcertainty it’s a belief that seems exempt from doubt as if it were the hinge on which my doubts and questions turn still i may seem the same “i” to you while i’ve already rolled it through the next door from left to right

 when i dare at last to imagine hunger see farmer wandering his parched fields knowing nothing to do finally but sleep the day out in the barns long shadow dreaming of the family dog he drove deep into a neighboring county and abandoned by the side of the road weeks later a boy finds it in a ditch timid and gimp a halo of gnats festering between its swollen testicles and wormy flanksand he coaxes it into some pines tethers it with a tentstake and a chain as the late summer light spirals and drapes over the branches a mirage the dog slavers and snaps at consider the boys amusement as he imagines the animal jerking the light down and the ruckus of bells that clang and catapult from the treetop belfries the canopy rent like a piñata spilling licorice and circus peanuts coins and fluttering dollar bills the real possibilities are beyond him the dog as a parable of pain or loss hunger as some small iridescent thing at work inside the animal hovering around its heart the way a lone dragonfly skirts the dry pond crater dismantling the daylight unstitched from dust dust unbuckled from air by now the dogs given up and the boy watches its tongue loll in the pine needles the heave and fall of its stomach its eyes following birdflight in and out of the shade restless for something he cannot name he imagines the music he might make if he thumped the dogs belly like a drum imagines its eyes are the color of iron imagines the unimaginable and does it the tire tool and the belly unwilling instruments and the dogs caterwaul is not like music at all and when night comes the cricketsong dulcifies nothing the dogs body is just a body is not paltry is not glorified what hunger is this that haunts the boy that haunts the man sleeping in the shade watch as the dragonfly dips into his open mouth and keeps going a blur between bone and sinew a wet thread collapsing soft caverns of flesh gone to where his body is a field honed by sleeves of sunlight to where the boy ceases to be and the man wakes he knows what flits through him now keeps the time with its thrumming carrying him away from himself into himself to where the dog roves in the shadows ravenous luminousits tail bobbing in the heat a winnowing sliver of light

 when awful darkness and silence reign over the great gromboolian plain through the long long wintry nights  when the angry breakers roar as they beat on the rocky shore  when stormclouds brood on the towering heights of the hills of the chankly bore   then through the vast and gloomy dark there moves what seems a fiery spark a lonely spark with silvery rays piercing the coalblack night  a meteor strange and bright  hither and thither the vision strays a single lurid light  slowly it wander  pauses  creeps  anon it sparkles  flashes and leaps and ever as onward it gleaming goes a light on the bongtree stems it throws and those who watch at that midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as the wild light passes along  the dong  the dong the wandering dong through the forest goes the dong the dong the dong with a luminous nose  long years ago the dong was happy and gay till he fell in love with a jumbly girl who came to those shores one day for the jumblies came in a sieve they did  landing at eve near the zemmery fidd where the oblong oysters grow and the rocks are smooth and gray and all the woods and the valleys rang with the chorus they daily and nightly sang  far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve  happily happily passed those days while the cheerful jumblies staid they danced in circlets all night long to the plaintive pipe of the lively dong in moonlight shine or shade for day and night he was always there by the side of the jumbly girl so fair with her skyblue hands and her seagreen hair till the morning came of that hateful day when the jumblies sailed in their sieve away and the dong was left on the cruel shore gazing  gazing for evermore  ever keeping his weary eyes on that peagreen sail on the far horizon  singing the jumbly chorus still as he sate all day on the grassy hill  far and few far and few are the lands where the jumblies live their heads are green and the hands are blue and they went to sea in a sieve  but when the sun was low in the west the dong arose and said  what little sense i once possessed has quite gone out of my head  and since that day he wanders still by lake and dorest marsh and hills singing  o somewhere in valley or plain might i find my jumbly girl again for ever ill seek by lake and shore till i find my jumbly girl once more  playing a pipe with silvery squeaks since then his jumbly girl he seeks and because by night he could not see he gathered the bark of the twangum tree on the flowery plain that grows and he wove him a wondrous nose  a nose as strange as a nose could be of vast proportions and painted red and tied with cords to the back of his head  in a hollow rounded space it ended with a luminous lamp within suspended all fenced about with a bandage stout to prevent the wind from blowing it out  and with holes all round to send the light in gleaming rays on the dismal night  and now each night and all night long over those plains still roams the dong and above the wail of the chimp and snipe you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe while ever he seeks but seeks in vain to meet with his jumbly girl again lonely and wild  all night he goes  the dong with a luminous nose and all who watch at the midnight hour from hall or terrace or lofty tower cry as they trace the meteor bright moving along through the dreary night  this is the hour when forth he goes the dong with a luminous nose yonder  over the plain he goes he goes he goes the dong with a luminous nose

 people traveled from miles away to see my paintings of fish the jeweled armor of their scales the beadlike  set of their eyes in rubbery socket rings the glimmering swish of fin and tail  so real it seemed that you could almost dip a net deep into the paper and pull up the arching wet  weight of a golden carp a shiny trout or the dark muscular heft of a bass with  its mouth stretched into the surprised wiry “oh” of a child’s wind sock i captured my models from the sea  lake and goldfish pond in the back garden so careful not to let their mouths be torn  by the hook their scales chipped or the silky tissue of their tails ripped by a clumsy hand i kept them in  large glass bowls fed them mosquito wings or dry silkworm pupas offered from chopsticks  and when i was finished making sketches i quickly took them back and set them free again every  night i dream i swim with these fish as a golden carpblack spots on cloisonné scales  pulled to the surface by the deceptive creamy luster of the moon or the sizzle of firefly lights  across the water and every night i am tempted once again by the smell  of the baited hook by my predictable hunger for earthly things and each time i am surprised again  by the stinging hook in my lip that pulls me mercilessly into the bright air  setting my gills on fire the sharp silver pain of the knife that slits me open so easily from tail  to throat to reveal the scarlet elastic of my raw gills the translucent film  of my air sac the milky rise of my stomach and the gray marbled coil of my intestines i rise  late each day and work in brighter light when i die i will have my paintings brought  down to the lake and slipped into the water first the edges of ink will blur and then there will be a great  flurry as the fins tails and bodies begin blossoming in to life again each  fish detaching from its canvas of silk or rice papera swirl of color motion swimming away

 a poetic romance  excerpt book i  a thing of beauty is a joy for ever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness but still will keep a bower quiet for us and a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing therefore on every morrow are we wreathing a flowery band to bind us to the earth spite of despondence of the inhuman dearth of noble natures of the gloomy days of all the unhealthy and oerdarkened ways made for our searching yes in spite of all some shape of beauty moves away the pall from our dark spirits such the sun the moon trees old and young sprouting a shady boon for simple sheep and such are daffodils with the green world they live in and clear rills that for themselves a cooling covert make gainst the hot season the mid forest brake rich with a sprinkling of fair muskrose blooms and such too is the grandeur of the dooms we have imagined for the mighty dead all lovely tales that we have heard or read an endless fountain of immortal drink pouring unto us from the heavens brink  nor do we merely feel these essences for one short hour no even as the trees that whisper round a temple become soon dear as the temples self so does the moon the passion poesy glories infinite haunt us till they become a cheering light unto our souls and bound to us so fast that whether there be shine or gloom oercast they always must be with us or we die  therefore tis with full happiness that i will trace the story of endymion the very music of the name has gone into my being and each pleasant scene is growing fresh before me as the green of our own valleys so i will begin now while i cannot hear the citys din now while the early budders are just new and run in mazes of the youngest hue about old forests while the willow trails its delicate amber and the dairy pails bring home increase of milk and as the year grows lush in juicy stalks ill smoothly steer my little boat for many quiet hours with streams that deepen freshly into bowers many and many a verse i hope to write before the daisies vermeil rimmd and white hide in deep herbage and ere yet the bees hum about globes of clover and sweet peas i must be near the middle of my story o may no wintry season bare and hoary see it half finishd but let autumn bold with universal tinge of sober gold be all about me when i make an end and now at once adventuresome i send my herald thought into a wilderness there let its trumpet blow and quickly dress my uncertain path with green that i may speed easily onward thorough flowers and weed

 emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering oer the mountains brow there is a path on the seas azure floor no keel has ever ploughd that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my hearts sister wilt thou sail with me our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea treading each others heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remaind a solitude but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home with everchanging sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemonflowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soulthey seem like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washd by the soft blue oceans of young air it is a favourd place famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountainpeaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the wingèd storms chanting their thunderpsalm to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality and from the sea there rise and from the sky there fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isles beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen oer the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic islandpeople know tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender oceanking ere crime had been invented in the worlds young prime reard it a wonder of that simple time an envy of the isles a pleasurehouse made sacred to his sister and his spouse it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumd its form then grown out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erasd and in the place of it the ivy and the wildvine interknit the volumes of their manytwining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winterwoof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen or fragments of the days intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one anothers arms and dream of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality  this isle and house are mine and i have vowd thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity our simple life wants little and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill the ringdove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her lovelament and the owls flit round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measurd by the pants of their calm sleep be this our home in life and when years heap their witherd hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one meanwhile we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour or linger where the pebblepaven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessd by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expird night asleep through which the awakend day can never peep a veil for our seclusion close as nights where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again and we will talk until thoughts melody become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our beings inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be confusd in passions golden purity as mountainsprings under the morning sun we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh wherefore two one passion in twinhearts which grows and grew till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigurd ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one anothers substance finding food like flames too pure and light and unimbud to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation woe is me the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of loves rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire i pant i sink i tremble i expire

 ’twas in the month of december and in the year 1883 that a monster whale came to dundee resolved for a few days to sport and play and devour the small fishes in the silvery tay  so the monster whale did sport and play among the innocent little fishes in the beautiful tay until he was seen by some men one day and they resolved to catch him without delay  when it came to be known a whale was seen in the tay some men began to talk and to say we must try and catch this monster of a whale so come on brave boys and never say fail  then the people together in crowds did run resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun so small boats were launched on the silvery tay while the monster of the deep did sport and play  oh it was a most fearful and beautiful sight to see it lashing the water with its tail all its might and making the water ascend like a shower of hail with one lash of its ugly and mighty tail  then the water did descend on the men in the boats which wet their trousers and also their coats but it only made them the more determined to catch the whale but the whale shook at them his tail  then the whale began to puff and to blow while the men and the boats after him did go armed well with harpoons for the fray which they fired at him without dismay  and they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons while they fired at him their sharp harpoons but when struck with the harpoons he dived below which filled his pursuers’ hearts with woe  because they guessed they had lost a prize which caused the tears to well up in their eyes and in that their anticipations were only right because he sped on to stonehaven with all his might  and was first seen by the crew of a gourdon fishing boat which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat but when they drew near they saw it was a whale so they resolved to tow it ashore without fail  so they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail and landed their burden at stonehaven without fail and when the people saw it their voices they did raise declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise  and my opinion is that god sent the whale in time of need no matter what other people may think or what is their creed i know fishermen in general are often very poor and god in his goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door  so mr john wood has bought it for two hundred and twentysix pound and has brought it to dundee all safe and all sound which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail so i advise the people far and near to see it without fail  then hurrah for the mighty monster whale which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling that is to say if the people all are willing

 my father’s farm is an apple blossomer he keeps his hills in dandelion carpet and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose and the jackinthepulpits his sleek cows ripple in the pastures the dog and purple iris keep watch at the garden’s end  his farm is rolling thunder a lightning bolt on the horizon his crops suck rain from the sky and swallow the smoldering sun his fields are oceans of heat where waves of gold beat the burning shore  a red fox pauses under the birch trees a shadow is in the river’s bend when the hawk circles the land my father’s grainfields whirl beneath it owls gather together to sing in his woods and the deer run his golden meadow  my father’s farm is an icicle a hillside of white powder he parts the snowy sea and smooths away the valleys he cultivates his rows of starlight and drags the crescent moon through dark unfurrowed fields

 darlings if your owners say you are not usually like this then i must take them  at their word  i am like you  not crazy about that which towers before me  particularly the buildings here  and the people inside  who look at my name  and make noises  that seem like growling  my small and eager darlings  what it must be like  to have the sound for love  and the sound for fear  be a matter of pitch  i am afraid to touch  anyone who might stay  long enough to make leaving  an echo  there is a difference  between burying a thing you love  for the sake of returning  and leaving a fresh absence  in a city’s dirt  looking for a mercy  left by someone  who came before you  i am saying that i  too  am at a loss for language  can’t beg myself  a doorway  out of anyone  i am not usually like this either  i must apologize again for how adulthood has rendered me  us really   i know you all forget the touch  of someone who loves you  in two minutes  and i arrive to you  a constellation of shadows  once hands  listen darlings  there is a sky  to be pulled down  into our bowls  there is a sweetness for us  to push our faces into  i promise  i will not beg for you to stay this time  i will leave you to your wild galloping  i am sorry  to hold you again  for so long  i am in the mood  to be forgotten

 myths of the landscape the sun going down in the mouths of the furnaces the fires banked and cooling ticking into dark here and there the sudden flaring into roses then the light across the long factory of the field the split and rusted castings across the low slant tin roofs of the buildings across fallow and tar and burnt potato ground    everything a little still on fire in sunlight then smoke then cinder then the milling back to earth rich earth the silica of ash the times i can taste the iron in the air the gray wash like exhaust smell the burnoff my eyes begin to tear and im leaning against a wall short of breath my heart as large as my fathers alone in such poverty my body scars the light arable fields waste and stony places waysides the day he got the job at the wellbaum and company foundry he wept and later in the truck pulled the plug on a bottle in the metallurgy of ore and coal and limestone in the conversion of the green world to gray in the face of the bluewhite fires i remember the fencerow the white campion calyx and coronal scales the hawthorns cut to the size of hedge the haws so deep in the blood of the season they bled the year we were poor enough to dig potatoes we had to drive there then wait for the men to leave who let fires go out thered be one good hour of daylight the rough straight rows running into shade wed work the ground until the sun was a single line i can see my father now cut in half by the horizon coming toward me both arms weighted down i can see him bending over gone later in the summer id have painted the dead rust undulant sides of all the buildings aluminum which in the morning threw a glare like water on the garden

 water no matter how much there is still not enough cunning life keeps asking for more and then a drop more our ankles are weighted with lead we delve under the wave we bend to our spades we survive the force of the gusher  our bodies fountain with sweat in the deeps of the sea our forehead aches and holds like a sunken prow we are out of breath divining the heart of the geyser constellations are bobbing like corks above on the swell  earth is a waterwheel the buckets go up and go down but to keep the whole aqueous architecture standing its ground we must make a ring with our bodies and dance out a round on the dreamt eye of water the dreamt eye of water the dreamt eye of water  water no matter how much there is still not enough come rain come thunder come deluged dams washed away our thirst is unquenchable a cloud in the water’s a siren we become two shades deliquescent drowning in song  my love under the tall sky of hope our love and our love alone keeps dowsing for water sinking the well of each other digging together each one the other’s phantom limb in the sea

 1 is it true that they dream  it is true for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose like a warm hollow below the shoulders or between the curve of thigh and belly the land itself can lie like this hence our understanding of giants the wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out and buries its face in the bruised sea we all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood the stars too bear witness we can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams a knot of sheets scratches defining the edges of the body the position of the legs upon waking the cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain  2 do they dream of the past or of the future  think of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs some unopened letters the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers think of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk cows for example find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk as far as the badger and the owl are concerned the past is a silver trout circling in the ice each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon clouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard deer are made visible by their hunger i could also mention the hopes of common spiders green thread sailing from an infinite spool a web a thin nest a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand  3 do they dream of this world or of another  the prairie lies open like a vacant eye blind to everything but the wind from the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities a black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings the buzzards grow bored with the dead a screendoor flapping idly on an august afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep there are sudden flashes of light to account for alligators tormented by knots and vines take these as a sign of grace eagles find solace in the far glow of towns in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed the lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes have other skies fallen into this sky all the evidence seems to say so conspiracy of air conspiracy of ice the silver trout is thirsty for morning the prairie dog shivers with sweat skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes their beaks still parted by whispering these are the languages that fall beyond our hearing imagine the way rain falls around a house at night invisible to its sleepers they do not dream of us  4 how can we learn more  this is all we will ever know

  in the shape of a submarine frost lengthens on a window outside winter sparrows perch in rhinoceroscolored trees mares tails chase whitely past brick chimneys i have seen those lights before small rectangular eyes of far buildings one church steeple darkening the blue sky      it looks like a stopped grey heart if hearts sport such delicate scallops and trees wear hearts on their sleeves now the first wasp of spring emerges its wings a transparency of fish scales old isinglass or veinfretted windows wings of the first untranscendent angel sentenced to death by the god frost how can some later spring reclaim this paper city or repair its walls damaged in the long drop from the one hundred and twentieth odd year of a tree      the sky wears that color through which you expect a tornados black drill only cicadas try the air a scratching that cannon could not silence beyond the barn with three siloes and the wind pump stopped like a tin daisy carp lip the surface of reflected sky the promised violence      i always imagined that place as an orchard on a mountaintop its summer delicious freckling to a sunset by seurat but the last time it was fall the sere grass bent one way toward an open gate as though a great wind had swept down stones of the garden walls two posts bent where the orchard had been their purpose obscure they stood i think where flowers had rivaled deepest in their colors and scents

 this unfinished business of my childhood this emerald lake from my journey’s other side haunts hierarchies of heavens  a palm forest fell overnight to make room for an unwanted garden ever since fevers and swellings turn me into a river   the streets were steep winds were running ahead of ships      there was indeed the death of birds the moon had passed away     the morning after his death pursuing him beyond his bitter end his mother came to his grave she removed his bones out of their pattern and ditched them into mud women came at night and claimed rimbaud their own   that night there was much thunder      it was awesome      laurels and lilacs bloom around my head because i stood up to the sun   you see     the colorado river runs between flowered banks i repeat my journeys to seek the happiness that overcame your absence i was happy not to love you anymore until the sunset reached the east and broke my raft apart there were other rivers underground covered with dead flowers it was cold it was cold yes it was cold      under a combination of pain and machinegun fire flowers disappeared they are in the same state of nonbeing as emily dickinson   we the dead have conversation in our gardens about our lack of existence      the gardener is planting blue and white flowers some angel moved in with me to flee the cold temperature on earth are rising but we wear upon us some immovable frost everyone carries his dying as a growing shadow      i left the morning paper by the coffee cup the heat was 85 like the year and i went to the window to find that flowers had bloomed overnight to replace the bodies felled in the war   the enemy had come with fire and ruse to stamp the names of the dead in the gardens of yohmor it is not because spring is too beautiful that we’ll not write what happens in the dark      a butterfly came to die between two stones at the foot of the mountain the mountain shed shadows over it to cover the secret of death

 what represses unhomes in the sound who has made me what is made me is a voice just muscles and shape and breath to phrase a song boats assemble at the mouth of the harbor mouth in earth you who wrote an ode to silence never wrote of what is silenced i did seek all resounding caves let the voice be lit all the lanterns in the new world we need the language of stone from string to string quiver in the opening the garden so beautiful lucifer dark sun of morning no eden but innocence no expulsion but after  •   no more will i listen to other than a single note moaned not known i do not here think again what place presents itself own moan well eye here body as a battery of the one moment when it is time to open your mouth to plug in i will allow what i invented to find its color make a shape which neither water nor sky do how do you now in this contained shape go through your life not like a constellation not guessed at intuited or divined no name so how do you discern a shape for what is often called gd  •   vantablack was made for missiles or planes for defense purposes so dark no eye could see it some voices are like that no one could hear them it is not good to be lost to

body’s the blue failed me the sun fails every evening i we you have all failed too everyone who strove all these long years for peace failed  •   august 7 predawn blue and blue the sound of the sea further away and less violent lights on the water fishing boats closer than i imagined no one is awake some animals maybe what i do without knowing in a harrowing world what i do without knowing as i listen to the gurgle of water against the promontory i feel like i am listening to a body how slow and opening a piece of tune where one does not know how it will unfold no chord or cadence to tell you in sound what the path will be how it will happen until it happens i do not want to be alone what does it mean anyway when someone says “muslim”  •   can she still feel music in her body can she vocalize even without technology of the mouth tongue palate glottis vocal chords what is a voice anish kapoor granted exclusive right to work with blackest black she now communicates through notes and gesture vantablack made for military purposes like sound also used for torture all sounds to wake you vibrate your brain what emerges as an echo from music as torture children on the beach playing god is sound or art or science shit and sex the body’s echo what mess is left in the big or the little death  •   sheila’s voice always in the background always disappearing into the music of what surrounds it the way one loses oneself in sex or death or the moment of shitting i got lost in salman’s music he said it was a surrender of ego when he left me behind but really it was a surrender of my will words too have god inside but for the prize of the body they do not compete can not hold the storm of time cannot hold the line do i touch the ocean inside will my family come to my funeral  •   that night we swam the full moon civilized us federated us gave us our nationality we who were lost i have now lost what little heritage i did have returned to the rude rough world long vowels of morning evening birds scream no soft blanket falling to cover but a throttling a suffocation of dusk no silence when the self stills the absence of noise is itself torture i cannot sleep tongued loose drones move through a riff by a singer without papers  •   august 9 eleanna takes me out on the water miller exploding the form of the novel itself i see now how nin wanted to move away from his vociferous singing of the world as material to try to construct a music of the way the mind works still fed by light on the water a mute noise of engines under water as the boat passes the light house and heads out for open sea remembering in palestine crawling down the hill trying to catch a wifi signal from the settlement untapped improvisation of space  •   at the stone terrace the gardener lingers clipping hedges while i work breeze between us soon i will return i read the article about a poet who was killed in the street his poems untranslated all the artists and writers killed the open space of the sea yesterday eleanna and i went too far out went almost all the way to marseille we saw the pinkgray sky of wildfire i accepted the waves i found in the chapters of the quran to sing my way through turbulence draw a way through the waves savage wildfire all the villages evacuated  •   we woke to the smell of burning air a little cool smell of charred refuse colors muted last night the moon came clear nearly blue eyes too painfully large rough on the eyes and impatient but i wanted to look so badly for the meteors the sea crashing against the rocks smoke from the fire obscured the sky in the morning we rowed across the harbor and realized fear of heights and fear of depth is the same just one you see and one you don’t

 in green water i saw your eye and in it i saw that arabian palace filled with birds and broken glass i copy an address into my right hand and fill myself with memories of psalms a green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave that rises like the wailing wall  my sunbaked body at the edge wind in my lungs its whistle my torn world my grief my soggy passport my shell with no pearl you lift them delicate cloud into a liquid world  last night i dreamed of my fathers flabby body and of my blue resolve to run away to find a way i dreamed of your eye and for an instant i found the vertex of the road the imaginary line that falls across the earth that meridian where the sun on a tigers back meets the shade at its belly  waking up we are swallowed by wakefulness the house swallows us in its terrible thirst the routine of taking our children to school swallows us and so does the if only i could  there was something to that dream you know it a direction a way a forest as green as you and your roots  give me your premonitions give me your book give me your prodigious memory give me the blue gaze from your dark eye give me the devotion of your sleeping birds  sometimes the way is a fire through which the circus tiger leaps a perfect circle returning to me with its stripes intact and with the endless continuity of this ineluctably feral world

 they were smooth ovals and some the shade of potatoes some had been motheaten or spotted the maples were starched and crackled like campfire  we put them under tracing paper and rubbed our crayons over them xraying the spread of their bones and black veined catacombs  we colored them green and brown and orange and cut them out along the edges labeling them deciduous or evergreen  all day in the stuffy air of the classroom with its cockeyed globe and nautical maps of ocean floors i watched those leaves  lost in their own worlds flap on the pins of the bulletin boards without branches or roots or even a sky to hold on to

 the earth has feelings some killed others in its mud and it has lots of mud  the earth builds a scrapyard a sequence of them to tell of this a seam on its embalmed glabella future galaxies caress  the earth knows andré breton compiles ingenuous personalities in its fevered correspondence  out of its winding sheet rolodex the earth erodes another name your name  beware the earth prepares to say one final time construction eclipses   it hoped to say nothing further and then was disappointed its hope misplaced it knew deep down  say more you say the earth had hoped you would  express as little as possible with your furniture find the little that is as near to nothing as can be  the monuments unpictured drift up like watermarks through the odor of the lens  you make things happen all the time says the earth take my advice look the other way

 around 530 is a beautiful peaceful time you can just hear the dog lapping david lifts his smoke to his lips forever dangling chain in the middle of everything bout the top shelf or so the party at which i sd that’s my col lected works and every one stared my home was so small is it i’m not particularly into the task of humility at the moment but i’m not against it it’s like that deflated beach ball on a tiny chair  i think of as joking with the larger one on a painting floating in air my home is large love made it large once not to get all john wieners amp believe me love made it small once this place only had sex unlike the house i love a house i fear a house a house never gets laid frankly who doesn’t like a hotel room i live in a hotel room a personal one a young person very much like me was brutal no personal photographs please   it was anyone’s home perfect for a party now i’m going fast how the description of a drug enters a room amp changes the room thus with going fast say thus if you want to go slow to drink the wrong thing for a moment for you to lick my thigh amp your honey face  i met a dog named izzie once i met a dog named alan the calm person writing her calm poems now amp then she shows her sacred heart she opens her chest amp a monkey god is taking a shit swinging on his thing you didn’t know i had so much inside me buckets of malice bibles of peace i don’t want to go all library on you now like my mother the mother of god or my brother named jack who sat in a deck of cards getting hard when she squeezes in getting cozy i know less what i want to say i can open an entire room comes out each moment that’s what i mean not things widen amp flow there’s no purpose to this

 for ann saddlemyer our heartiest welcomer i  vowels ploughed into other opened ground the mildest february for twenty years is mist bands over furrows a deep no sound vulnerable to distant gargling tractors our road is steaming the turnedup acres breathe now the good life could be to cross a field and art a paradigm of earth new from the lathe of ploughs my lea is deeply tilled old ploughsocks gorge the subsoil of each sense and i am quickened with a redolence of farmland as a dark unblown rose wait thenbreasting the mist in sowers’ aprons my ghosts come striding into their spring stations the dream grain whirls like freakish easter snows  ii  sensings mountings from the hiding places words entering almost the sense of touch ferreting themselves out of their dark hutch ‘these things are not secrets but mysteries’ oisin kelly told me years ago in belfast hankering after stone that connived with the chisel as if the grain remembered what the mallet tapped to know then i landed in the hedgeschool of glanmore and from the backs of ditches hoped to raise a voice caught back off slughorn and slow chanter that might continue hold dispel appease vowels ploughed into other opened ground each verse returning like the plough turned round  iii  this evening the cuckoo and the corncrake so much too much consorted at twilight it was all crepuscular and iambic out on the field a baby rabbit took his bearings and i knew the deer i’ve seen them too from the window of the house like connoisseurs inquisitive of air were careful under larch and maygreen spruce i had said earlier ‘i won’t relapse from this strange loneliness i’ve brought us to dorothy and william’ she interrupts ‘you’re not going to compare us two’ outside a rustling and twigcombing breeze refreshes and relents is cadences  iv  i used to lie with an ear to the line for that way they said there should come a sound escaping ahead an iron tune of flange and piston pitched along the ground but i never heard that always instead struck couplings and shuntings two miles away lifted over the woods the head of a horse swirled back from a gate a grey turnover of haunch and mane and i’d look up to the cutting where she’d soon appear two fields back in the house small ripples shook silently across our drinking water as they are shaking now across my heart and vanished into where they seemed to start  v  soft corrugations in the boortree’s trunk its green young shoots its rods like freckled solder it was our bower as children a greenish dank and snapping memory as i get older and elderberry i have learned to call it i love its blooms like saucers brimmed with meal its berries a swart caviar of shot a buoyant spawn a light bruised out of purple elderberry it is shires dreaming wine boortree is bower tree where i played ‘touching tongues’ and felt another’s texture quick on mine so etymologist of roots and graftings i fall back to my treehouse and would crouch where small buds shoot and flourish in the hush  vi  he lived there in the unsayable lights he saw the fuchsia in a drizzling noon the elderflower at dusk like a risen moon and green fields greying on the windswept heights ‘i will break through’ he said ‘what i glazed over with perfect mist and peaceful absences’ sudden and sure as the man who dared the ice and raced his bike across the moyola river a man we never saw but in that winter of nineteen fortyseven when the snow kept the country bright as a studio in a cold where things might crystallize or founder his story quickened us a wild white goose heard after dark above the

bright names this morning in the bay that toiled like mortar it was marvellous and actual i said out loud ‘a haven’ the word deepening clearing like the sky elsewhere on minches cromarty the faroes  viii  thunderlight on the split logs big raindrops at body heat and lush with omen spattering dark on the hatchet iron this morning when a magpie with jerky steps inspected a horse asleep beside the wood i thought of dew on armour and carrion what would i meet bloodboltered on the road how deep into the woodpile sat the toad what welters through this dark hush on the crops do you remember that pension in les landes where the old one rocked and rocked and rocked a mongol in her lap to little songs come to me quick i am upstairs shaking my all of you birchwood in lightning  ix  outside the kitchen window a black rat sways on the briar like infected fruit ‘it looked me through it stared me out i’m not imagining things go you out to it’ did we come to the wilderness for this we have our burnished bay tree at the gate classical hung with the reek of silage from the next farm tartleafed as inwit blood on a pitchfork blood on chaff and hay rats speared in the sweat and dust of threshing what is my apology for poetry the empty briar is swishing when i come down and beyond inside your face haunts like a new moon glimpsed through tangled glass  x  i dreamt we slept in a moss in donegal on turf banks under blankets with our faces exposed all night in a wetting drizzle pallid as the dripping sapling birches lorenzo and jessica in a cold climate diarmuid and grainne waiting to be found darkly asperged and censed we were laid out like breathing effigies on a raised ground and in that dream i dreamthow like you this our first night years ago in that hotel when you came with your

 when she rises in the morning i linger to watch her she spreads the bathcloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge and her swung breasts sway like fullblown yellow gloire de dijon roses  she drips herself with water and her shoulders glisten as silver they crumple up like wet and falling roses and i listen for the sluicing of their raindishevelled petals in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold until it glows as mellow as the glory roses

 for my grandmother theresa frank some slow evenings when the light hangs late and stubborn in the sky gives itself up to darkness slowly and deliberately slow cloud after slow cloud slowness enters me like something familiar and it feels like going home  it’s all there in the disappearing light all the evenings of slow sky and slow loving slow boats on sluggish bayous the thickmiddled trees with the slowsounding namesoak mimosa pecan magnolia the slow tree sap that sticks in your hair when you lie with the trees and the maple syrup and pancakes and grits the butter melting slowly into and down the sides like sweat between breasts of sloeeyed strippers and the slowthroated blues that floats over the city like fog and the weeping the willows the cut onions the cayenne the slowcooking beans with marrowthick gravy and all the mint juleps drunk so slowly on all the slow southern porches the bourbon and sugar and mint going down warm and brown syrup and slow and all the ice cubes melting in all the iced teas all the slowfaced people sitting in all the slowly rocking rockers and the crabs and the shrimp and crawfish the hard shells slowly and deliberately and lovingly removed the delicate flesh slowly sucked out of heads and legs and tails and the slow lips that eat and drink and love and speak that slow luxurious language savoring each word like a longmissed lover and the slowmoving nuns the black habits dragging the swollen ground and the slow river that cradles it all and the chicory coffee that cuts through it all slowboiled and black as dirt and the slow dreams and the slowhealing wounds and the slow smoke of it all slipping out ballooning into the skyslow deliberate and magnificent

 the scent of pig is faint tonight as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue  looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard with a sense of solidarity also forgotten  its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimed i was still softfingered when i planted you  in the plane her gaze rests on a flock of cloudbirds pinkish purple with elongated necks rests  on the plane’s wingtip colored pink by the sun her head is heavy with this childhood cargo  like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole  or the barge that passes every day at four its metal nose just out of the water while empty at eight its sleek sides  flash signals to those on shore later on the highway a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun  a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum on their backsbegins to reassemble memories  the petals become lining the shape of the flower is lost so that years later looking at an old photograph  she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles but the exact bend in the river behind them the pattern of trees

 “in warm sunlight jade engenders smoke” poetry like indigo mountain keeps its distance  the light plays words and figures stone’s edge edged with air green haze growing  amused by butterflies chuang tsu dreaming the emperor’s heart in spring thoroughly transformed  still in pieces the words rest so much apart risking my life i lean on dangerous railings   when the dream wakes to its own particulars the strands scattered loose hair on muslin  broken characters the reeds make unmake vague    no reason bright    again    dark

 morning   reading the bones wetting a fingertip to trace archaic characters i feel a breeze of silence flow up past my wrist icy can i speak here the bones say i must as the first light strikes across the lake magpies scream and the cast bones say the work must come true it’s been true all along we are what we do out on our digs dictor and looker all eyes with spade and a jeweler’s loupe i sift mud amp dust for bone for shellcast spy archeologist of freshness i expect sightmadesound to reveal fear cold at the throat of change and loosen its grip so that mind riding the bloodwarm stream wells up as the speech that bears it and is telling   evening   magpies scream though the tongues of birds say now and warn forward free of a live past we seek back and forth for change the ghostly sparkling of our watertable under everywhere if i don’t speak to tap amp ease it out i go dry amp dumb amp will die wicked on the lake of the poets a stone lamp flickers it casts eight moons dancing casting doubt on the moon that rides above the winter air ice thaws in a poet’s throat the springing truth is fresh it wakes taste the taste lasts language floods the mud mind makes a cast of words it precipitates mercurial like t’ang discourse riding the tidal constant of its source

 i always forget the name delphinium even though it was the flower  the hummingbirds loved best they came in pairssleek emeraldbright  heads the clockwork machinery of their blurred wings thrumming swift menacing engines  they slipped their beaks as if they were swizzle sticks deep into the blue  throat of delphinium and sucked dry the nectar chilled hearts like goblets full of sweet  frozen daiquiri i liked to sit on the back porch in the evenings  watching them and eating spanish peanuts rolling each nut between thumb and forefinger  to rub away the red salty skin like brittle tissue paper  until the meat emerged gleaming yellow like old ivory smooth as polished bone  and late august after exclamations of gold flowers tiny  and bitter the caragana trees let down their beans to ripen dry and rupture  at first there was the soft drum of popcorn slick with oil puttering some  where in between seed heat and cloud then sharp cracks like cap gun or diminutive fireworks  caragana peas catapulting skyward like pellet missiles  sometimes a meadowlark would lace the night air with its elaborate melody  rippling and sleek as a black satin ribbon some times there would be  a falling star and because this happened in wyoming and because this was  my parents’ house and because i’m never happy with anything  at any time i always wished that i was some where anywhere else but here

 the new root of the fern is the part you eat in famine harsh words are spoken but they’re not the ones that make you turn where the muscle’s smooth that’s where it doesn’t fray the hard part is what comes easy the hard part isn’t hard  it only seems it only seems it only seems that way the snail inside the shell is tough it holds the tooth not tongue the fingernail the hair what the old ropes come from what’s left dug up and laid aside not the nick that never healed  there are lice that live inside the quill of every feather of every bird you spoil it with a fingerprint artichokes have hearts the alligator pear has an endosperm that when squeezed weeps only oil you shed your skin as you grow cold the hard part isn’t hard

 and then tony showed us the lake where he had thrown some of his sadness last summer and it had dissolved like powder so he thought maybe the lake could take some of the radiant aluminum kind he had been making lately and it did it was a perfect lake none of the paint had chipped off no bolts showing the arms that dante and virgil would have to hack through not even breaking the surface mumbling italian to itself it had climbed down two wooden stairs back to the beach now that the rains were done how strange to be water so close to the ocean yet the only other water you get to talk to comes from the sky maybe this is why it seems so willing to take on tony’s sadness which sometimes corrodes his friends which is really many different sadnesses smaller and smaller surrounded by more and more space each a world and at its core an engine like a bee inside a lily like buzzing inside the bee it seems like nothing could change its color although we couldn’t tell what color it was it kept changing in the summer tony says he comes down early each day and there’s no one around so the lake barely says a thing when he dives in and once when his kitchen was on fire in maine and he was asleep the lake came and bit his hand trying to drag him to safety and some nights in new mexico he can hear it howling searching for him in the desert so we’re glad tony has this lake and we promise to come back in august and swim with him across maybe even race

 my mare when she was in heat would travel the fenceline for hours wearing the impatience in her feet into the ground  not a stallion for miles i’d assure her give it up  she’d widen her nostrils sieve the wind for news be moving again her underbelly darkening with sweat then stop at the gate a moment wait to see what i might do oh i knew how it was for her easily recognized myself in that wide lust came to stand in the pasture just to see it played offered a hand a bucket of grain a minute’s distraction from passion the most i gave  then she’d return to what burned her the fence the fence so hoping i might see might let her free i’d envy her then to be so restlessly sure of heat and need and what it takes to feed the wanting that we are  only a gap to open the width of a mare the rest would take care of itself surely surely i knew that who had the power of bucket and bridle she would beseech me sidle up be gone as life is short but desire desire is long

 excerpt book i  deep in the shady sadness of a vale far sunken from the healthy breath of morn far from the fiery noon and eves one star sat grayhaird saturn quiet as a stone still as the silence round about his lair forest on forest hung about his head like cloud on cloud no stir of air was there not so much life as on a summers day robs not one light seed from the featherd grass but where the dead leaf fell there did it rest a stream went voiceless by still deadened more by reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade the naiad mid her reeds pressd her cold finger closer to her lips  along the marginsand large footmarks went no further than to where his feet had strayd and slept there since upon the sodden ground his old right hand lay nerveless listless dead unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed while his bowd head seemd listning to the earth his ancient mother for some comfort yet  it seemd no force could wake him from his place but there came one who with a kindred hand touchd his wide shoulders after bending low with reverence though to one who knew it not she was a goddess of the infant world by her in stature the tall amazon had stood a pigmys height she would have taen achilles by the hair and bent his neck or with a finger stayd ixions wheel her face was large as that of memphian sphinx pedestald haply in a palace court when sages lookd to egypt for their lore but oh how unlike marble was that face how beautiful if sorrow had not made sorrow more beautiful than beautys self there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up one hand she pressd upon that aching spot where beats the human heart as if just there though an immortal she felt cruel pain the other upon saturns bended neck she laid and to the level of his ear leaning with parted lips some words she spake in solemn tenour and deep organ tone some mourning words which in our feeble tongue would come in these like accents o how frail to that large utterance of the early gods saturn look upthough wherefore poor old king i have no comfort for thee no not one i cannot say o wherefore sleepest thou for heaven is parted from thee and the earth knows thee not thus afflicted for a god and ocean too with all its solemn noise has from thy sceptre passd and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty thy thunder conscious of the new command rumbles reluctant oer our fallen house and thy sharp lightning in unpractisd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain o aching time o moments big as years all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe saturn sleep ono thoughtless why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude why should i ope thy melancholy eyes saturn sleep on while at thy feet i weep  as when upon a tranced summernight those greenrobd senators of mighty woods tall oaks branchcharmed by the earnest stars dream and so dream all night without a stir save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence and dies off as if the ebbing air had but one wave so came these words and went the while in tears she touchd her fair large forehead to the ground just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturns feet one moon with alteration slow had shed her silver seasons four upon the night and still these two were postured motionless like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern the frozen god still couchant on the earth and the sad goddess weeping at his feet until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone and all the gloom and sorrow of the place and that fair kneeling goddess and then spake as with a palsied tongue and while his beard shook horrid with such aspenmalady o tender spouse of gold hyperion thea i feel thee ere i see thy face look up and let me see our doom in it look up and tell me if this feeble shape is saturns tell me if thou hearst the voice of saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow naked and bare of its great diadem peers like the front of saturn who had power to make me desolate whence came the strength how was it nurturd to such bursting forth while fate seemd strangled in my nervous grasp but it is so and i am smotherd up and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale of admonitions to the winds and seas of peaceful sway above mans harvesting and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love ini am gone away from my own bosom i have left my strong identity my real self somewhere between the throne and where i sit here on this spot of earth search thea search open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round upon all space space starrd and lorn of light space regiond with lifeair and barren void spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell search thea search and tell me if thou seest a certain shape or shadow making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile it mustit must be of ripe progresssaturn must be king yes there must be a golden victory there must be gods thrown down and trumpets blown of triumph calm and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan voices of soft proclaim and silver stir of strings in hollow shells and there shall be beautiful things made new for the surprise of the skychildren i will give command thea thea thea where is saturn  this passion lifted him upon his feet and made his hands to struggle in the air his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat his eyes to fever out his voice to cease he stood and heard not theas sobbing deep a little time and then again he snatchd utterance thusbut cannot i create cannot i form cannot i fashion forth another world another universe to overbear and crumble this to nought where is another chaos wherethat word found way unto olympus and made quake the rebel threethea was startled up and in her bearing was a sort of hope as thus she quickvoicd spake yet full of awe this cheers our fallen house come to our friends o saturn come away and give them heart i know the covert from thence came i hither thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space he followd and she turnd to lead the way through aged boughs that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest  meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed more sorrow like to this and such like woe too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe the titans fierce selfhid or prisonbound groand for the old allegiance once more and listend in sharp pain for saturns voice but one of the whole mammothbrood still kept his sovreignty and rule and majesty blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat still snuffd the incense teeming up from man to the suns god yet unsecure for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex so also shuddered he not at dogs howl or gloombirds hated screech or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell or prophesyings of the midnight lamp but horrors portiond to a giant

fiery galleries and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flushd angerly while sometimes eagles wings unseen before by gods or wondering men darkend the place and neighing steeds were heard not heard before by gods or wondering men also when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense breathd aloft from sacred hills instead of sweets his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick and so when harbourd in the sleepy west after the full completion of fair day for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody he pacd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal on from hall to hall while far within each aisle and deep recess his winged minions in close clusters stood amazd and full of fear like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers even now while saturn rousd from icy trance went step for step with thea through the woods hyperion leaving twilight in the rear came slope upon the threshold of the west then as was wont his palacedoor flew ope in smoothest silence save what solemn tubes blown by the serious zephyrs gave of sweet and wandering sounds slowbreathed melodies and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape in fragrance soft and coolness to the eye that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown for the god to enter in  he enterd but he enterd full of wrath his flaming robes streamd out beyond his heels and gave a roar as if of earthly fire that scard away the meek ethereal hours and made their dovewings tremble on he flared from stately nave to nave from vault to vault through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light and diamondpaved lustrous long arcades until he reachd the great main cupola there standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot and from the basements deep to the high towers jarrd his own golden region and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceasd his voice leapt out despite of godlike curb to this result o dreams of day and night o monstrous forms o effigies of pain o spectres busy in a cold cold gloom o lankeard phantoms of blackweeded pools why do i know ye why have i seen ye why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new saturn is fallen am i too to fall am i to leave this haven of my rest this cradle of my glory this soft clime this calm luxuriance of blissful light these crystalline pavilions and pure fanes of all my lucent empire it is left deserted void nor any haunt of mine the blaze the splendour and the symmetry i cannot seebut darkness death and darkness even

terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer rebel jove and bid old saturn take his throne again he spake and ceasd the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out hush so at hyperions words the phantoms pale bestirrd themselves thrice horrible and cold and from the mirrord level where he stood a mist arose as from a scummy marsh at this through all his bulk an agony crept gradual from the feet unto the crown like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way with head and neck convulsd from overstrained might releasd he fled to the eastern gates and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush he breathd fierce breath against the sleepy portals cleard them of heavy vapours burst them wide suddenly on the oceans chilly streams the planet orb of fire whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through spun round in sable curtaining of clouds

 the northern lights         i wouldn’t have noticed them if the deer hadn’t told me a doe         her coat of pearls         her glowing hoofs proud and inquisitive eager for my appraisal and i went out into the night with electrical steps but with my head held also proud to share the animal’s fear and see what i had seen before a sky flaring and spectral greenish waves and ribbons and the snow         under strange light         tossing in the pasture like a storming ocean caught by a flaring beacon the deer stands away from me         not far there among bare black apple trees a presence i no longer see we are proud to be afraid proud to share the silent magnetic storm that destroys the stars and flickers around our heads like the saints’ cold spiritual agonies of old i remember         but without the sense         other lightstorms cold memories discursive and philosophical in my mind’s burden and the deer remembers nothing we move our feet         crunching bitter snow         while the storm crashes like godwars down the east we shake the sparks from our eyes we quiver inside our shocked fur we search for each other in the apple thicket a glimpse an acknowledgment it is enough and never enough we toss our heads         and say good night moving away on bitter bitter snow

 i wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high oer vales and hills when all at once i saw a crowd a host of golden daffodils beside the lake beneath the trees fluttering and dancing in the breeze  continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way they stretched in neverending line along the margin of a bay ten thousand saw i at a glance tossing their heads in sprightly dance  the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee a poet could not but be gay in such a jocund company i gazedand gazedbut little thought what wealth the show to me had brought  for oft when on my couch i lie in vacant or in pensive mood they flash upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude and then my heart with pleasure fills and dances with the daffodils

 in the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan earth stood hard as iron water like a stone snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow in the bleak midwinter long ago  our god heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed the lord god almighty jesus christ  enough for him whom cherubim worship night and day breastful of milk and a mangerful of hay enough for him whom angels fall before the ox and ass and camel which adore  angels and archangels may have gathered there cherubim and seraphim thronged the air but his mother only in her maiden bliss worshipped the beloved with a kiss  what can i give him poor as i am if i were a shepherd i would bring a lamb if i were a wise man i would do my part yet what i can i give him give my heart

 there lies a somnolent lake under a noiseless sky where never the mornings break nor the evenings die  mad flakes of colour whirl on its even face iridescent and streaked with pallour and warding the silent place  the rocks rise sheer and gray from the sedgeless brink to the sky dulllit with the light of pale halfday thro’ a void space and dry  and the hours lag dead in the air with a sense of coming eternity to the heart of the lonely boatman there that boatman am i  i in my lonely boat a waif on the somnolent lake watching the colours creep and float with the sinuous track of a snake  now i lean o’er the side and lazy shades in the water see lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide crawled in from the living sea  and next i fix mine eyes so long that the heart declines on the changeless face of the open skies where no star shines  and now to the rocks i turn to the rocks around that lie like walls of a circling sun wherein lie bound  the waters that feel my powerless strength and meet my homeless oar labouring over their ashen length never to find a shore  but the gleam still skims at times on the somnolent lake and a light there is that swims with the whirl of a snake  and tho’ dead be the hours i’ the air and dayless the sky the heart is alive of the boatman there that boatman am i

 i would drive the predawn dark to stake my spot to fish for dinner to numb my hands in the ice bucket to pluck from the neat stack a herring to fit the skullcap and pierce the eye with a toothpick the body doublehooked my fingertips glimmering with the scales of the dead while the line whined free from the reel and the bait arced out over the tidal current on a point in view of   the town where i lived  where i had become a man with no money suddenly concerned only with money for there were mouths and i had helped to make them   the eddy swirled kept my line taut my whole body taut though a man a few down the row laughed sitting back on his bucket while he pulled in more fish than he could take  i hated the other men hated the ones who caught nothing who crossed lines or hooked gulls who plucked even birds from the sky and slowly drew them in while they struggled and looked away even finally in the hands of the man who only wanted them free  i climbed the breakwater and fished and spoke to no one  i baited my line and thought of a woman who would carry my body over the threshold of our small white house simply with her eyes because i had brought something home for her for us our boys at my side while one fish was divided and indeed did feed many   now to sift the facts for truth  i reeked of   the sea and had nothing to show for it  darkling saltwater for a dream and no other place to be

 i will arise and go now and go to innisfree and a small cabin build there of clay and wattles made nine beanrows will i have there a hive for the honeybee and live alone in the beeloud glade  and i shall have some peace there for peace comes dropping slow dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings there midnight’s all a glimmer and noon a purple glow and evening full of the linnet’s wings  i will arise and go now for always night and day i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore while i stand on the roadway or on the pavements grey i hear it in the deep heart’s core  
NEW POEM
 day and night the lake dreams of sky a privacy as old as the mountains and her up there stuck among peaks the whole eye  fastened on hawk gatherings of cloud or stars so little trespass an airplane once crossed her brow she searched but could not find  a face having lived with such strict beauty she comes to know how the sun is nothing but itself and the path it throws the moon  a riddled stone if only a hand would tremble along her cheek would disturb even the elk pass by drawn to the spill of creeks below  how she cannot help abundance even as it leaves her as it sings all the way down the mountain

NEW POEM
 beneath the waver of the dorsal fin lie the bloodshades of lamellae their skin so close to the vein they breathe  filter gather flex set down in loose and frangible parallels you find in gills of mushrooms clams and concertinas  wave after wave the tissues of the water breathers conceal what they reveal according to their vital rhythm  fins that breathe flit this way that in the giveandtake of panic and lust and tropical surge from no one place  to every fish flesh nightmare and song a private opening and the name it bears let us call it tomorrow or lament  the heart of my volition

 surviving in its fragile skin a white egret rises from the gulf of its strength i want the lightest needle of a pine to fall on my hand a pine with ravaged limbs  id stare through saltblind eyes at a remote fragile sea   id roar id make the skeleton of grief id roar like you unreconciled sea

 and what about this boulder knocked off the moutaintop and tumbled down a thousand years ago  to lodge against the streambank does it waste itself with worry about how things are going  to turn out does the current slicing around it stop itself mid stream because it cant get past  all its left behind back at the source or up in the clouds where its waters first fell  to earth and these trees would they double over and clutch themselves or lash out  furiously if they were to discover what the other trees really thought of them would the wind  reascend into the sky forever like an indrawn breath if it knew it was fated simply  to sweep the earth of windlessness to touch everything and keep nothing and be beheld by no one  
NEW POEM
 to mary   1  so now my summer task is ended mary and i return to thee mine own hearts home as to his queen some victor knight of fa ë ry earning bright spoils for her inchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light  2  the toil which stole from thee so many an hour is endedand the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of mossgrown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been  3  thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass i do remember well the hour which burst my spirits sleep a fresh maydawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes  4  and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground so without shame i spakei will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check i then controuled my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold  5  and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined  6  alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clog until revived by thee  7  thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long  8  no more alone through the worlds wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood  9  now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power which sayslet scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath lifes beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me the parents of the song i consecrate to thee  10  is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence neer to sound again though it might shake the anarch customs reign and charm the minds of men to truths own sway holier than was amphions i would fain reply in hopebut i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey  11  and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally  12  they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder notfor one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name  13  one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desart hears the music of his homeunwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and lowthoughted cares like thunderstricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwellingplace  14  truths deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind on his pure name who loves themthou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the worlds tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seamans sight that burn from year to year

 i dont know how it happened but i fell and i was immense one dislocated arm wedged between two buildings i felt some ribs had broken perhaps a broken neck too i couldnt speak my dress caught bunched about my thighs and where my glasses shattered thered spread something like a seacoast or maybe it was a port where my hair tangled with power lines i felt a hot puddle of blood i must have passed out but when i woke a crew of about fifty was building a winding stairway beside my breast and buttressing a platform on my sternum i heard as through cotton the noise of hammers circular saws laughter and some radio droning songs about love out the corner of one eye i could open one eye a bit i saw my pocketbook its contents scattered my lipsticks toppled silo glinting out of reach and then waving a tiny flashlight a man entered my ear i felt his boots sloshing the blood trickling there he never came out so some went looking with flares dogs dynamite even they burst my middle ear and found my skull its cavern crammed with dark matter like a cross between a fungus and a cloud they never found his body though and they never found or tried to find an explanation i think for me they didnt seem to need one even now my legs subdue that dangerous sea the water bright enough to cut the skin where a lighthouse perched on the tip of my great toe each eight seconds rolls another flawless pearl across the waves it keeps most ships from wrecking against my feet on clear days people stand beside the light they watch the waves blue heads slip up and down and scan for landmarks on the facing shore

 saturday morning in late march i was alone and took a long walk though i also carried a book of the alone which companioned me  the day was clear unnaturally clear like a freshly wiped pane of glass a window over the water and blue preternaturally blue like the sky in a magritte painting and cold vividly cold so that you could clap your hands and remember winter which had left a few moments ago if you strained you could almost see it disappearing over the hills in a black parka spring was coming but hadnt arrived yet i walked on the edge of the park the wind whispered a secret to the trees which held their breath and scarcely moved on the other side of the street the skyscrapers stood on tiptoe  i walked down to the pier to watch the launching of a passenger ship ice had broken up on the river and the water rippled smoothly in blue light the moon was a faint smudge in the clouds a brushstroke an afterthought in the vacant mind of the sky seagulls materialized out of vapor amidst the masts and flags dont let our voices die on land they cawed swooping down for fish and then soaring back upwards  the kiosks were opening and couples moved slowly past them arm in arm festive children darted in and out of walkways which sprouted with vendors voices greeted the air kites and balloons handmade signs voyages to unknown places the whole day had the drama of an expectation  down at the water the queenly ship started moving away from the pier banners fluttered the passengers clustered at the rails on deck i stood with the people on shore and waved goodbye to the travelers some were jubilant others were brokenhearted i have always been both  suddenly a great cry went up the ship set sail for the horizon and rumbled into the future but the cry persisted and cut the air like an iron bell ringing in an empty church i looked around the pier but everyone else was gone and i was left alone to peer into the ghostly distance i had no idea where that ship was going but i felt lucky to see it off and bereft when it disappeared

 “the experience of truth is indispensible for the experience of beauty and the sense of beauty is guided by a leap in the dark” arthur koestler i   stoplights edged the licorice street with ribbon neon embroidering wet sidewalks she turned  into the driveway and leaped in the dark a blackbird perched on the bouncing twig of a maple heard  her whisper “stranger lover the lost days are over while i walk from car to door something inward opens  like four o’clocks in rain earth cold from autumn pulls me i can’t breathe the same  with dirt for marrow and mist for skin blurring my vision my vision’s separate self  i stand drunk in this glitter under the sky’s grey shelter the city maple not half so bitter hurls itself  in two directions until both tips darken and disappear as i darken my reflection in the smoking mirror  of my home how faint the sound of dry leaves like the clattering keys of another morning another world”  ii   she looked out the window at some inward greying door the maple held her glance made ground fog from her cigarette  beyond uneven stairs children screamed gunned each other down then she sealed her nimble dreams  with water from a murky bay “for him i map this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer  when it rains i remember his face in the corridor of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth  his wrinkled forehead unguarded eyes the foreign fruit of an intricate sadness with the grace that remains  i catch a glint around a door i cannot enter the clock echoes in dishtowels i search love’s center  and bang pans against the rubble of my day the lucid grandeur of wet ground the strangeness of a fatal sun  that makes us mark on the margin of our loss trust in the gossamer of touch trust in the lateplowed field”  iii   when the sun opened clouds and walked into her mongrel soul she chopped celery into rocky remnants of the sea  and heard fat sing up bread a better dying the magnet in each seed of the green pepper kept her flying  floating toward memories that throb like clustered stars the dark water laughter of ducks a tangle of november oaks  toward sudden music on a wheel of brilliant dust where like a moon she must leap back and forth  from emptiness “i remember the moon shimmering loss and discovery along a water edge and skirting  a slice of carrot i welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn rare and real i dance while vegetables sing in pairs  i hug my death my chorus of years and search and stretch and leap for i will be apprentice to the blood  in spite of the mood of a world that keeps rusting rusting the wild throats of birds”  iv   in lamplight she saw the smoke of another’s dream her daughter walk woods where snow weighs down pine  her son cry on a bridge that ends in deeprooted dark her man stalled on a lonely road realize his torque  was alcohol and hatred “hungry for silence i listen to wind to the sound of water running down mountain  my own raw breath between the sounds a seaborn god plays his reed in the caverns of my being  i wear his amethyst let go my dreams millars lacewings and junebugs scatter widen and batter the dark  brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss  and lets us forgive so that we can answer birds and deer lightning and rain shadow and hurricane  truth waits in the creek cutting the winter brown hills it sings with needles of ice sings because of its scar”

 i’ll know the time to leave the room where i’ve been growing hair from my face drinking dark beers when the light in the lake bums out that’s when fish turn on their music they lie in a blue current waiting for the moon to pass over and the fishermen with their lanterns know this as they spill a can of sweet corn and wonder if they spoke what they were just thinking  i clear my way through the fog as music will break through static the frogs strike up a window goes out in the home for elders don’t you wonder why it is built far from anywhere as though memory needs a terrain for forgetting blind driveways to lost roads as for my own parents they did not grow old what i know dinners without conversation stars that shine for anyone i know my time is brief i know love of the cut sleeve  i want to say don’t feel sorry for men those who leave women smouldering like cigarettes those who are fond of burials war is a habit of mind i swear by my mother’s gender  tonight sticks in the leaves are slick as pilot snakes wherever i part branches no one is in a boat no one has stirred a wake not jackknifing off the dock it’s hauling myself back up that gooses my titties and makes my peter shrink  don’t wake the cottonmouths summertime if you were here and you remembered to stash your smokes in a glad bag so they didn’t soak like mine we’d fall quiet now as pollen on water i would tell you the true story of urashima and the turtle

 nothing by or for itself the sound of eggs hardboiling in the hot water echoed by the heavy rain that pours down the broken spout the cowardly lion’s roar answered by the moos of the buffalo the bloody mouth of the one by the sharp and polished horns of the other even nelson eddy could hear someone else singing in his bathtub the songs from his dumb movies  though when i once drove up the vertical highway in colorado to visit elaine the gnostic and take her to the stone mountain where her husband fell we drove back without talking though she touched my knee in gratitude and when we reached the very top there were no trees only flowers grew there accompanied by nothing the name of which was loneliness which shelley the poet himself suffered from among his beleaguered women you’ll die remembering

   one hundred breaths split the air as i lean on the only pine tree i find it’s early or late it’s breezy or hot the fields are dry summer is near the horses are everywhere strangely galloping a dream but i can’t remember how to call them so i stand back watch them pass     the first time i rode a horse my body found the music of fire crackling the wind an unbearable pleasure that also left me with a burn on the side of my leg a sign the horsekeeper told meof longing a need to returnto belong after all departure is like pushing the weight of our heart against the village whose name has kept us awake     rafael came from somewhere in eurasia i passed my hands through his mane saw a history of conquests and battles a field of hay a mount of truth heard a silent ring his eyes asking me to go with him to confess something sacred to name something lustful nothing of where he came from or who i was disturbed us     i knew he was different by the way he ran without pause without grace without distraction without ease he was told how to move in the world and resented it he knew he would never own anything     he came toward me it was a quiet afternoon i stood unmoving and we listened to the untitled music circling the earth like an anthem free of its nation     he was unfamiliar to me approaching as if he possessed the land every morning he stopped five feet from the river

 in a drawer i found a map of the world folded into eighths and then once again and each country bore the wrong name because the map of the world is an orphanage  the edges of the earth had a margin as frayed as the hem of the falling night and a crease moved down toward the center of the earth halving the identical stars  every river ran with its thin blue brother out from the heart of a country there cedars twisted toward the southern sky and reeds plumed eastward like an augur’s pens  no dates on the wrinkles of that broad face no slow grinding of mountains and sand for all at once like a knife on a whetstone the map of the world spoke in snakes and tongues  the hardtopped roads of the western suburbs and the distant lights of the capitol each pull away from the yellowed beaches and step into the lost sea of daybreak  the map of the world is a canvas turning away from the painter’s inkstained hands while the pigments cake in their little glass jars and the brushes grow stiff with forgetting  there is no model shy and halfundressed no open window and flickering lamp yet someone has left this sealed blue letter this gypsy’s bandana on the darkening  table each corner held down by a conch shell what does the body remember at dusk that the palms of the hands are a map of the world erased and drawn again and  again then covered with rivers and earth

 i have had to learn the simplest things last which made for difficulties even at sea i was slow to get the hand out or to cross a wet deck the sea was not finally my trade but even my trade at it i stood estranged from that which was most familiar was delayed and not content with the man’s argument that such postponement is now the nature of obedience that we are all late in a slow time that we grow up many and the single is not easily known  it could be though the sharpness the achiote i note in others makes more sense than my own distances the agilities  they show daily who do the world’s businesses and who do nature’s as i have no sense i have done either  i have made dialogues have discussed ancient texts have thrown what light i could offered what pleasures doceat allows  but the known this i have had to be given a life love and from one man the world tokens but sitting here i look out as a wind and water man testing and missing some proof  i know the quarters of the weather where it comes from where it goes but the stem of me this i took from their welcome or their rejection of me  and my arrogance was neither diminished nor increased by the communication   2  it is undone business i speak of this morning with the sea stretching out from my feet

 in the backyard of our house on norwood there were five hundred steel cages lined up each with a wooden box roofed with tar paper inside two stories with straw for a bed sometimes the minks would pace back and forth wildly looking for a way out or else they’d hide in their wooden houses even when we’d put the offering of raw horse meat on their trays as if they knew they were beautiful and wanted to deprive us in spring the placid kits drank with glazed eyes sometimes the mothers would go mad and snap their necks my uncle would lift the roof like a god who might lift our roof look down on us and take us out to safety sometimes one would escape he would go down on his hands and knees aiming a flashlight like a bullet of light hoping to catch the orange gold of its eyes he wore huge boots gloves so thick their little teeth couldn’t bite through “they’re wild” he’d say “never trust them” each afternoon when i put the scoop of raw meat rich with eggs and vitamins on their trays i’d call to each a greeting their small thin faces would follow as if slightly curious in fall they went out in a van returning sorted matched their skins hanging down on huge metal hangers pinned by their mouths my uncle would take them out when company came and drape them over his armthe sweetest cargo he’d blow down the pelts softly and the hairs would part for his breath and show the shining underlife which like the shining of the soul gives us each character and beauty

 i never glimpse her but she goes who had been basking in the sun her links of chain mail one by one aglint with pewter bronze and rose  i never see her lying coiled atop the garden step or under a dark leaf unless i blunder and by some motion she is foiled  too late i notice as she passes zither of chromatic scale i only ever see her tail quicksilver into tall grasses  i know her only by her flowing by her glamour disappearing into shadow as i’m nearing i only recognize her going

 momus is the name men give your face the brag of its tone like a long low steamboat whistle finding a way mid mist on a shoreland where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray against horizons purple silent  yes momus men have flung your face in bronze to gaze in gargoyle downward on a streetwhirl of folk they were artists did this shaped your sad mouth gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm broad wisdom all your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes purple silent fled from all the iron things of life evaded like a sought bandit gone into dreams by god  i wonder momus whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter on men who play in terrible earnest the old known solemn repetitions of history a droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze you give me the human ease of a mountain peak purple silent granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves careless eyewitness of the spawning tides of men and women swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil the salt of tears and blood drops of undiminishing war

 for pos moua what is the name for an antelope who grazes inside a dream  then vanishes into the nebula’s brush  what is the face for refurbishing grammar  at each comma’s lip whose identity never  remembers the shape of beige what is the word  for how to conjure the sigh of a line hushed  beneath the flap of a thousand shifting plumes  what is the body of a garden where a crescent  despairs drifts beneath the melt of amber  the season is always growing out its hooves  one cradlesong of your leaving is not larger  than the forest of your arrival to make you a noun forever  a loss of you cannot be equal to the loss of you

 the moon is distant from the sea – and yet with amber hands – she leads him – docile as a boy – along appointed sands –  he never misses a degree – obedient to her eye – he comes just so far – toward the town – just so far – goes away –  oh signor thine the amber hand – and mine – the distant sea – obedient to the least command thine eye impose on me –

 i was so worried the hickory i recognized had died from salt burn in the last hurricane i may have passed by vervain and apple haw like they didn’t matter but this spring it put out seven shoots from its base still the oldest trick is the moon missing then the “new” moon appears though we know it’s the old one and we pretend to be taken in like the mother or baby behind the bath towel really it’s the moon winking being the stone that holds stones and now footprints and when i tell frances i see she is a moon motionless in the doorway skin reflecting a lamp a face that awakens on paper

 o joys infinite sweetness with what flow’rs and shoots of glory my soul breaks and buds all the long hours of night and rest through the still shrouds of sleep and clouds this dew fell on my breast oh how it bloods and spirits all my earth hark in what rings and hymning circulations the quick world awakes and sings the rising winds and falling springs birds beasts all things adore him in their kinds thus all is hurl’d in sacred hymns and order the great chime and symphony of nature prayer is the world in tune a spirit voice and vocal joys whose echo is heav’n’s bliss o let me climb when i lie down the pious soul by night is like a clouded star whose beams though said to shed their light under some cloud yet are above and shine and move beyond that misty shroud so in my bed that curtain’d grave though sleep like ashes hide my lamp and life both shall in thee abide

 i see the mosquito kneeling on the soft underside of my arm kneeling like a fruitpicker kneeling like an old woman with the proboscis of her prayer buried in the idea of god and i know we shall not speak with the aliens and that peace will not happen in my life not unless it is in the burnt oil spreading across the surfaces of ponds in the dark egg rafts clotting and the wiggletails expiring like batteries bring a little alcohol and a little balm for these poppies planted by the queen of neptune in her photographs she is bearded and spurred embellished five hundred times her modular legs crouching her insufferable head unlocking to lower the razoredge of its tubes and she is there in the afternoon when the wind gives up the spirit of cleanliness and there rises from the sound the brackish oyster and squid smell of creation i lie down in the sleeping bag sodden with rain nights with her i am loved for myself for the succulent flange of my upper lip the twin bellies of my eyelids she adores the easy the soft she picks the tenderest blossoms of insomnia mornings while the jackhammer rips the pavement outside my window while the sanitation workers bang the cans against the big truck and shout to each other over the motor i watch her strut like an udder with my blood imagining the luminous pick descending into trotsky’s skull and the eleven days i waited for the cold chill nightmare and nightsweat of malaria imagining the mating call in the vibrations of her wings and imagining in the simple knot of her ganglia how she thrills to my life how she sings for the harvest

 sleepy and suburban at dusk i learn again the yard’s geometry edging around the garden and the weedy knots of flowers circling trees and shrubs giving a wide berth to the berry patch heavy and sprawled out of its bounds shoving such a machine around a fairway of dandelions it is easy to feel absurd the average lawn left alone one hundred years could become a hardwood forest an admirable project still i carry on following week on week the same mowing pattern cutting edges almost sprinting the last narrow swaths and tonight as i mow over the bushels of fallen peaches sending pits soaring over the neighbors’ fences seems hardly any different but on one crooked march i walk across the thin hidden hole to a yellowjacket hive the blade pulls them up from their deep sweet chamber just as my bare legs go by  a bee lands heavily all blunder and revenge and the sting is a quick embrace and release like the dared kid’s run and touch of a blind man i’m blind now with the shock and pain of it howling in a sprint toward the house the mower flopped on its side wild blade loose in the darkening air later the motor sputtered quiet starved by tilt i’m back in the twilight a halfdozen stings packed in wet tobacco carrying a can of gasoline a fivefoot torch the destruction is easy shove can slow to entranceway lip pull back and light torch use torch to tip can one low whump and it’s over a few flaming drones flutter out and fall stragglers late returners cruise wide circles around the ruins in the cool september night they fly or die in the morning i finish my chores  all the way to winter the blackened hole remains on christmas eve a light late snow covers it and all the lawn’s other imperfections crabgrass hummocks high maple roots the mushroomladen fairy ring that defies obliteration and appears every spring more visible than ever standing in the window the scent of pine powerful around me the snap of wood undoing itself in the stove i wonder at this thin and cold camouflage falling gradually falling over what has gone and grown before and i hear that other rattle and report that engine driven by another fire i think of a gold that is sweet and unguent a gold that is a blaze of years behind me i hear wind in its regular passes blowing across the roof feel in my legs a minute and icy tingling as though i have stood too long in one place or made again another wrong step as though the present itself were a kind of memory coiled waiting dying to be seen from tomorrow

 hanshan sits on a flat stone in his garden and plays the flute mimicking the birds singing among the gourd vines or from the top of the blue pine tree  or he constructs a new trellis for the rambling rose over his front gate or works at the great loom in his porch weaving his own coverlets  sometimes he paints drinking gourds to hang at his cold spring  his poems delicate but strong paper the ceiling above his bed so he can lie and read his own masterpieces  no man he avers can catch such fish in one basket

 i do not understand the poets who tell me that i should not personify every morning the willow auditions for a new role  outside my bedroom windowtoday she is clytemnestra yesterday a southern belle lost in her own melodrama sinking on her skirts  nor do i like the mathematicians who tell me i cannot say the zinnias are counting on their fingers or the dog is practicing her geometry  even though every day i watch her using the yards big maple as the apex of a triangle from which she bisects the circumference  of the lawn until she finds the place where the rabbit has escaped or the squirrel upped the ante by climbing into a new euclidian plane  she stumbles across the lawn eyes pulling her feet along gaze fixed on a rodent working the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention  her feet tangling in the roots of trees and tripping yes even over themselves until i go out to assist by pointing at the squirrel and repeating there  there but instead of following my outstretched arm to the crown of the tree where the animal is now lounging under a canopy of leaves  catching its breath charting its next escape she looks to my mouth eager to read my lips confident that iwho can bring her home  from across the field with a word who can speak for the willow and the zinnia can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree

 some dictator or other had gone into exile and now reports were coming about his regime the usual crimes torture false imprisonment cruelty and corruption but then a detail that the way his henchmen had disposed of enemies was by hammering nails into their skulls horror then what mind does after horror after that first feeling that you’ll never catch your breath mind imagineshow not be annihilated by itthe preliminary tap feels it in the tendons of the hand feels the way you do with your nail when you’re fixing something making something shelves a bed the first light tap to set the slant and then the slightly harder tap to embed the tip a little more   no no more this should be happening in myth in stone or paint not in reality not here it should be an emblem of itself not itself something that would mean not really have to happen something to go out expand in implication from that unmoved mass of matter in the breast as in the image of an anguished face in grief for us not us as us us as in a myth a moral tale a way to tell the truth that grief is limitless a way to tell us we must always understand it’s we who do such things we who set the slant embed the tip lift the sledge and drive the nail drive the nail which is the axis upon which turns the brutal human world upon the world

 there was a fire in the night across the street i slept among the others as the ashes snowed upon small pines i slept owning nothing a child ignorant of fortune’s blistering story the playful flash in the dark the unseen smolder that would leave us revealed unchanged i said my prayers for luck but the man trying to live in two houses answers me now losing neither the old one whose windows burst with weariness nor the one halfbuilt whose roofless green timbers he would leave unfinished like a vision i had climbed there all summer to smoke  awake i found him sitting at his stool halfway between the houses where i would go each morning the story of the sea would be upon his tongue his hands weaving the wire to a trap making the careful seams to catch a scuttling crab beyond him his wife already had begun to stretch her wash indifferent in that early light and a dog lapped from the ruts of the fire truck  i believed little had been changed by fire only his toolshed limp as a black sail left in a heap and a new hole in the landscape this was an old place where no one came luckless desperate eternal as guilt in silence i greeted that old one but now i remember seeing also as if for the first time the shocking gray face of the sea it loomed up human and beautiful as far off the figures of boats crossed worked and seemed to sink while they burned in the sullen sun

 in the woods at the corner of our yards we hang the plywood squares the magic marker images of pronghorn panther grizzly whitetail and step off the paces we use to measure our skill here in the soft light filtering through needles and cones green shifting membrane of poplar hickory live oak white skin of dogwood beginning to flower we heft the blades grind points on stone gauge the fine balance between what is real and what is imagined the knives bringing all the animals to life and killing them again as our throws bury steel deep in the heart of the quivering wood and the blades tremble back through their bones in our own hearts we love what they might be their shapes frozen in brush as though suddenly they had turned from wood and caught our scent drifting in a windshift so we hunt this suburb whet our aim to move among them in the little wilderness beyond the brickedin beds of azaleas sunflowers tied against tall sticks the halfacres of razored grass trellised vines boxwoods manicured by wives

 1 when the loons cry the night seems blacker the water deeper  across the shore an eyelashcharcoal fringe of pine trees  2 the lake reflects indefinite pewter  and intermittent thunder lets us know  the gods are arriving one valley over  3 after the long melancholy of the fall one longs for the crisp brass shout of winter  the blaze of firewood the window’s spill of parlor lamplight across the snow  4 flaring like a match dropped in a dry patch one sunset tells the spectrum’s story  see the last hunter’s flashlight dim as he hurries home to his lighted window

 the body is a nation i have not known the pure joy of air the moment between leaping from a cliff into the wall of blue below like that or to feel the rub of tired lungs against skin covered bone like a hand against the rough of bark like that “the body is a savage” i said for years i said that the body is a savage as if this safety of the mind were virtue not cowardice for years i have snubbed the dark rub of it said “i am better lord i am better” but sometimes in an unguarded moment of sun i remember the cowdungscent of my childhood skin thick with dirt and sweat and the screaming grass but this distance i keep is not divine for what was christ if not god’s desire to smell his own armpit and when i see him i know he will smile fingers glued to his nose and say “next time i will send you a down as a dog to taste this pure hunger”

 to reg  1season opener  the ants are licking open the peonies unwrapping the seal to the tight globes of bloom    they gang up on and chase away a ladybug i can sit here    on the porch stoop as on the step    of an amphitheater and watch    ours is a great sports city the tour guides say   even the house roofs are bleachers    some ball is always in the air ready to open    its colors fragrance like stadium food scent reaches the street    our mouths drop open    tongues about to do the work   2  the wind is so high the lake surface contracts in a gasp  the waves jump straight up  our side must be winning  i cant hear the crowd of whitecap i see from the bus run  the joggers and cyclists look as though hysterically they carry  themselves     the news and breaking sound        that maybe  theres not another side to water        nor to the whole of what we play  we field against a fog or the home game in solids ice in a change of uniform  we contend against what is and is ourselves        though  we want a side that isnt ours to have of the universe    to have us on our feet  like the waves cheering on this morning this morning  we want our messengers to lie    a pool of good news  dead silent at our feet for us to walk open    our winnings winning or not still won a life  that lets us live it the excitement    of winged ankles seas of dancing streets in the envelope   3  when the waves jumped straight up the messenger sand smashed them to pieces for winning  when the surface fainted back the stampeding sky sank its foot in that face to leave winning  there were two countless words for the score you hear the roar of silence over winning  someone screaming what are you doing what are you doing    something answers i am winning  doing nothing is thrown out the window to eliminate that way to deal with winning  we burned gridlocked cars in morse code before we took off running to say living is winning  lake shore drive reads chicago is living life city quoting the song          winning   4  the whole street     ladies lay afloat in the gondola stroll     of their own legs  the daylit lanterns of their dreams hide inexpressibly their faces made up with not being in kansas  they fan with maps like feathers of brightly colored directions to famous brands  of which this street is that one direction     and all one direction only         no movement  as if since people move there are no people on this street the stalks of the buildings reeds a hem of the lake sweeps through   5  daylight you see peoples reflections off each other fill the street cascading one from another the crowd slips like a fan out of itself  in the angling of store displays the glass facets kaleidoscope a rose window back of themselves full of the flash petals of grace  that fall by evening home when the ones dressed in evening wear        possessionless and so without reflection here        take all the empties back  all the want and people scavenged back off the streets     into these who dine with starving    off the streets   6  the street in the opening between buildings is running a strip of the el like a frame by frame tape the windows of the train different shots of the sky then it breaks  and the clouds are caught up in the walls of nearby glassskin architecture i never get to see what i think would be the whole movie i too move on  the turns in the drive roll the buildings out from behind one another in a scenery change only i am the one on wheels the drop backs a larger stage than this town  and just as i can see betrayal coming by the music my eyes braille the thunder hidden even up the sleeve of a silent film the hand shakes anyway not meant  to be the end of things an inbound train toward the loop will be arriving shortly the street in the opening   7  the john hancock building has never struck the actual oil it looks like it should wildcatters call this a dry hole but it isnt it has the pool of lake michigan  on the bottom when youre looking from the top what an amazing hole he said enchantments name to call into      what we all are looking for a spell to an opening as deep     into seeing  he had the gift of new    first time in a city pick pockets hadnt sighted yet the eyes the bulging wealth of openness the shiny change we were watching the old movie of our century  our village root the wells drawnwords drip into volumes in our pack trying to solve our plot a closeup on the winchrope frayed by so continuously raising the question  cuts off    not to mislead the viewer and screened on our bodies the billboard buses city wall the crude that is this day struck from our drilling   8  all over everything    the sun rises funny i heard the eagle flies on friday as the eagle shits on friday where i lived not enough for any growth to get paid  its flowers mostly weed bouquet of distraction broken glass season gives way to plastic in the lots only the packaging changes it snows something or other year round  white to deal with powder or rock or through the window the country unable to stop opening its poverties making the sun go round to the back but the sun reserves its someday  someday to shine where door don llow light and i am drenched by a slow barely brought in gusher of my working through the cracks a gold opened in myself like a vein through  blinding pain through the names of

 what can i tell you it was a summer that seemed to be making history  their personal history  almost before it began and they stood back slightly still in it but observing it saying “the summer this” “the summer that” all the while it was going on they became obsessed with a fountain for example one they walked past each day how abundantly it would reach upwards and yet be pouring back down itself the whole time  all winter this fountain had been dry not saying a word what more can i tell you oh everything  like how they would walk home in the evenings when the light was soft anything bad sliding off them and they would feel owned completely owned in a good way by the air which would touch them constantly sometimes urgently sometimes lightly just to let them know it was there and they would think maybe this is what being alive is when they saw how complicated a tree was and how it wanted them looking at it and saying this how the color of a particular flower at this particular moment was redder even than the life force whatever that is if you could open it up and get right down inside it if you could put your mouth to it and become as red as that rose even it was still redder than that and they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves so they wouldn’t do anything except listen to the songs in their heads which were sad ones like nearly all good songs and watch this feeling rolling in sunshine or rain we don’t know yet it’s a good one it’s the best one though it has no name

 this happened long ago before the onset of universal genetic correctness  boys and girls would stand naked before mirrors studying the defects of their structure  nose too long ears like burdocks sunken chin just like a mongoloid  breasts too small too large lopsided shoulders penis too short hips too broad or else too narrow  and just an inch or two taller  such was the house they inhabited for life  hiding feigning concealing defects  but somehow they still had to find a partner  following incomprehensible tastesairy creatures paired with potbellies skin and bones enamored of salt pork  they had a saying then “even monsters have their mates” so perhaps they learned to tolerate their partners’ flaws trusting that theirs would be forgiven in turn  now every genetic error meets with such disgust that crowds might spit on them and stone them  as happened in the city of k where the town council voted to exile a girl  so thickset and squat that no stylish dress could ever suit her  but let’s not yearn for the days of prenormalization just think of the torments the anxieties the sweat the wiles needed to entice in spite of all   translated by clare cavanagh

 the first time i went to the tree was to knock on wood  no one answered the second time i knocked the tree wild in the wind  leaned toward me no bad luck arrived i went back and knocked again  to tell the tree my good fortune was not forgotten  •   chiseling a nest hole in dead wood a woodpecker drills a downed log  the rapid blows of its beak hammer me awake each night for a week  •   beneath the bark nymphs live like hidden charms  people leave in drawers or cupboards for protection  i believe in tree spirits who embed their souls in this wood  •   they are not immortal  •   but their lives says hesiod are ten times  that of the phoenix who outlives nine ravens who outlive  three glorious stags who outlive four crows who outlive  nine generations of aged men  •   beyond the shelter belts of farmsteads found deep  in poplar woods and birch thickets a flicker assaults a tree  as nymphs retreat into the tunneled ruts of the trunk  the bird chips away without distraction its showy  red patch a splash of blood catches my eye  •   tender wing buds of an immature insect  are like the rising nipples of a young girl  the temptation to slide a finger over the small mounds  •   fly away  •   the nymphs are free changed forever as they brush  the ponds scalloped edge what part of me they take away will settle some day  deep in dying wood i will be there when you knock

 home thou returnst from thames whose naiads long have seen thee lingring with a fond delay mid those soft friends whose hearts some future day shall melt perhaps to hear thy tragic song go not unmindful of that cordial youth whom long endeard thou leavst by lavants side together let us wish him lasting truth and joy untainted with his destined bride go nor regardless while these numbers boast my shortlived bliss forget my social name but think far off how on the southern coast i met thy friendship with an equal flame fresh to that soil thou turnst whose evry vale shall prompt the poet and his song demand to thee thy copious subjects neer shall fail thou needst but take the pencil to thy hand and paint what all believe who own thy genial land  there must thou wake perforce thy doric quill tis fancys land to which thou settst thy feet where still tis said the fairy people meet beneath each birken shade on mead or hill there each trim lass that skims the milky store to the swart tribes their creamy bowl allots by night they sip it round the cottagedoor while airy minstrels warble jocund notes there evry herd by sad experience knows how winged with fate their elfshot arrows fly when the sick ewe her summer food forgoes or stretched on earth the heartsmit heifers lie such airy beings awe th untutored swain nor thou though learned his homelier thoughts neglect let thy sweet muse the rural faith sustain these are the themes of simple sure effect that add new conquests to her boundless reign and fill with double force her heartcommanding strain  evn yet preservd how often mayst thou hear where to the pole the boreal mountains run taught by the father to his listning son strange lays whose powr had charmed a spensers ear at evry pause before thy mind possessed old runic bards shall seem to rise around with uncouth lyres in manycoloured vest their matted hair with boughs fantastic crowned whether thou biddst the welltaught hind repeat the choral dirge that mourns some chieftain brave when evry shrieking maid her bosom beat and strewed with choicest herbs his scented grave or whether sitting in the shepherds shiel thou hearst some sounding tale of wars alarms when at the bugles call with fire and steel the sturdy clans pourd forth their bonny swarms and hostile brothers met to prove each others arms  tis thine to sing how framing hideous spells in skyes lone isle the gifted wizard seer lodged in the wintry cave with            or in the depth of uists dark forest dwells how they whose sight such dreary dreams engross with their own visions oft astonished droop when oer the watry strath or quaggy moss they see the gliding ghosts unbodied troop or if in sports or on the festive green their        glance some fated youth descry who now perhaps in lusty vigour seen and rosy health shall soon lamented die for them the viewless forms of air obey their bidding heed and at their beck repair they know what spirit brews the stormful day and heartless oft like moody madness stare to see the phantom train their secret work prepare  stanza 5 and the first eight lines of stanza 6 are missing  what though far off from some dark dell espied his glimmring mazes cheer th excursive sight yet turn ye wandrers turn your steps aside nor trust the guidance of that faithless light for watchful lurking mid th unrustling reed at those mirk hours

 from the high terrace porch i watch the dawn no light appears though dark has mostly gone sunk from the cold and monstrous stone the hills lie naked but not light the darkness spills down the remoter gulleys pooled will stay too low to melt not yet alive with day below the windows the lawn matted deep under its closecropped tips with dewy sleep gives off a faint hush all its plushy swarm alive with coolness reaching to be warm gray windows at my back the massy frame dull with the blackness that has not a name but down below the garden is still young of five years’ growth perhaps and terracehung drop by slow drop of seeping concrete walls such are the bastions of our pastorals  here are no palms they once lined country ways where old white houses glared down dusty days with small round towers bluntheaded through small trees those towers are now the hiving place of bees the palms were coarse their leaves hung thick with dust the roads were muffled deep but now deep rust has fastened on the wheels that labored then peace to all such and to all sleeping men i lived my childhood there a passive dream in the expanse of that recessive scheme  slow air slow fire o deep delay of time that summer crater smoked like slaking lime the hills so dry so dense the underbrush that where i pushed my way the giant hush was changed to soft explosion as the sage broke down to powdered ash the sift of age and fell along my path a shadowy rift  on these rocks now no burning ashes drift mowed lawn has crept along the granite bench the yellow blossoms of acacia drench the dawn with pollen and with waxen green the long leaves of the eucalypti screen the closer hills from viewlithe tall and fine and nobly clad with youth they bend and shine the small dark pool jutting with living rock trembles at every atmospheric shock blurred to its depth with the cold living ooze from cloudy caves heavy with summer dews the shyest and most tremulous beings stir the pulsing of their fins a lucent blur that like illusion glances off the view the pulsing mouths like metronomes are true  this is my father’s house no homestead here that i shall live in but a shining sphere of glass and glassy moments frail surprise my father’s phantasy of paradise which melts upon his death which he attained with loss of heart for every step he gained too firmly gentle to displace the great he crystallized this vision somewhat late forbidden now to climb the garden stair he views the terrace from a window chair his friends hard shaken by some twenty years tremble with palsy and with senile fears in their late middle age gone cold and gray fine men now broken that the vision stay they spend astutely their depleted breath with tired ironic faces wait for death  below the garden the hills fold away deep in the valley a mist fine as spray ready to shatter into spinning light conceals the city at the edge of night the city on the tremendous valley floor draws its dream deeper for an instant more superb on solid loam and breathing deep poised for a moment at the edge of sleep  cement roads mark the hills wide bending free of cliff and headland dropping toward the sea through suburb after suburb vast ravines swell to the summer drone of fine machines the driver melting down the distance here may cast in flight the faint hoof of a deer or pass the faint head set perplexedly and manmade stone outgrows the living tree and at its rising air is shaken men are shattered and the tremor swells again extending to the naked salty shore rank with the sea which crumbles evermore

 we dont see the ocean not ever but in july and august when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay of this valley you could be walking through a fig orchard when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment you get a whiff of salt and in that moment you can almost believe something is waiting beyond the pacheco pass something massive irrational and so powerful even the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it  you probably think im nuts saying the mountains have no word for ocean but if you live here you begin to believe they know everything they maintain that huge silence we think of as divine a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls slowly between the pines and the wind dies to less than a whisper and you can barely catch your breath because youre thrilled and terrified  you have to remember this isnt your land it belongs to no one like the sea you once lived beside and thought was yours remember the small boats that bobbed out as the waves rode in and the men who carved a living from it only to find themselves carved down to nothing now you say this is home so go ahead worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust wait on the wind catch a scent of salt call it our life

 in memoriam mary ann 1932–1980 the five or six of them sitting on the rocks out at lanesville near gloucester it is like listening to music several of them are teachers one is a psychologist one is reading a book the page glares white in the summer sunlight others are just sunning themselves or just sitting there looking out over the water a couple of them seem to be talking together from this far off you can’t hear what they are saying  the day is hot the absolute middle of summer someone has written an obscenity in huge letters on the rocks above and behind this group of people and someone else one of them maybe or maybe a neighbor the owner of one of the cottages up behind and back in the woods has tried to erase it and only partly done so so that for years it will say hoarsely fuck  to the random winds and to the senseless waves  one of them is sitting with her back turned to me and to the others on the rocks the purple loosestrife and the tigerlilies are like the flags of some celebration they bloom along the edge of a small stream that makes its way unseen down to the rocks and sand her shoulders are round and rather luxuriously heavy and the whole figure has a youthful and graceful amplitude of being whose beauty will last her her whole life long  the voices of some people out in a boat somewhere are carried in over the water with surprising force and clarity though saying i don’t know what happiness unhappiness something about the conditions of all such things work done not done the saving of the self in the intense work of its singleness learning to live with it their lives have separate ends suddenly she turned her head and seems to look toward me and toward the others on the rocks  so that her body turned away is more expressive than her blank face a pure reflector of light

 i the owl and the pussycat went to sea in a beautiful peagreen boat they took some honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a fivepound note the owl looked up to the stars above and sang to a small guitar o lovely pussy o pussy my love what a beautiful pussy you are you are you are what a beautiful pussy you are  ii pussy said to the owl you elegant fowl how charmingly sweet you sing o let us be married too long we have tarried but what shall we do for a ring they sailed away for a year and a day to the land where the bongtree grows and there in a wood a piggywig stood with a ring at the end of his nose his nose his nose with a ring at the end of his nose  iii dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling your ring said the piggy i will so they took it away and were married next day by the turkey who lives on the hill they dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with a runcible spoon and hand in hand on the edge of the sand they danced by the light of the moon the moon the moon they danced by the light of the moon

 downhill i came hungry and yet not starved cold yet had heat within me that was proof against the north wind tired yet so that rest had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof  then at the inn i had food fire and rest knowing how hungry cold and tired was i all of the night was quite barred out except an owl’s cry a most melancholy cry  shaken out long and clear upon the hill no merry note nor cause of merriment but one telling me plain what i escaped and others could not that night as in i went  and salted was my food and my repose salted and sobered too by the bird’s voice speaking for all who lay under the stars soldiers and poor unable to rejoice

 my sister and i went out to them with sugar cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down to eat from our palms we led them over to the long white fence on which we climbed to the topmost rail then threw our legs across their backs clutching the reins to steady ourselves against their girth steering them out into the hills until we were lost or thought we were only to find ourselves at judith creek or holcomb rock where we’d turn back in the early dark gripping their manes crouching low galloping hard on the high soft road across the fields to the open barn

 when god at first made man having a glass of blessings standing by “let us” said he “pour on him all we can let the world’s riches which dispersèd lie contract into a span”  so strength first made a way then beauty flowed then wisdom honour pleasure when almost all was out god made a stay perceiving that alone of all his treasure rest in the bottom lay  “for if i should” said he “bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gifts instead of me and rest in nature not the god of nature so both should losers be  “yet let him keep the rest but keep them with repining restlessness let him be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead him not yet weariness may toss him to my breast”

 oh greenly and fair in the lands of the sun the vines of the gourd and the rich melon run and the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold with broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold like that which oer ninevehs prophet once grew while he waited to know that his warning was true and longed for the stormcloud and listened in vain for the rush of the whirlwind and red firerain  on the banks of the xenil the dark spanish maiden comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden and the creole of cuba laughs out to behold through orangeleaves shining the broad spheres of gold yet with dearer delight from his home in the north on the fields of his harvest the yankee looks forth where crooknecks are coiling and yellow fruit shines and the sun of september melts down on his vines  ah on thanksgiving day when from east and from west from north and from south come the pilgrim and guest when the grayhaired new englander sees round his board the old broken links of affection restored when the carewearied man seeks his mother once more and the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before what moistens the lip and what brightens the eye what calls back the past like the rich pumpkin pie  oh fruit loved of boyhood the old days recalling when woodgrapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling when wild ugly faces we carved in its skin glaring out through the dark with a candle within when we laughed round the cornheap with hearts all in tune our chair a broad pumpkinour lantern the moon telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam in a pumpkinshell coach with two rats for her team  then thanks for thy present none sweeter or better eer smoked from an oven or circled a platter fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine brighter eyes never watched oer its baking than thine and the prayer which my mouth is too full to express swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less that the days of thy lot may be lengthened below and the fame of thy worth like a pumpkinvine grow and thy life be as sweet and its last sunset sky goldentinted and fair as thy own pumpkin pie

 her body is not so white as anemony petals nor so smoothnor so remote a thing it is a field of the wild carrot taking the field by force the grass does not raise above it here is no question of whiteness white as can be with a purple mole at the center of each flower each flower is a hand’s span of her whiteness wherever his hand has lain there is a tiny purple blemish each part is a blossom under his touch to which the fibres of her being stem one by one each to its end until the whole field is a white desire empty a single stem a cluster flower by flower a pious wish to whiteness gone over or nothing

 with acknowledgments to “rain” by cynthia barnett whether the rain on mars was delicate or brutal  whether it was blue or gray  whether it fell on bare rocks that remained bare or on fertile ground that raised large forests of leafing trees  it could not last  mars froze eventually in the same duration that venus by contrast bowed her burning head in noxious vapors and gas clouds   •   on planet earth meanwhile  after half a billion years of continuous volcanohavoc meteor storms earthquakes               and lightning strikes  vapor stored in the atmosphere eventually began falling  it soothed the fires  when the fires died it fell silently on the first outcrops of moss  on the tender grass with a sizzle  with more strenuous drumming on the resilient fronds of ferns  it became an orchestra of millions across the luxurious expanse of the tree canopy  •   then the sun wiped its forehead with long filmy fingers and beamed afresh  it worked through to creatures flourishing beneath the canopy and persuaded them to interrupt their work of scouring on all fours for delectable roots and berries  in the clarified light they stared at their hands  they saw the wrinkled fingertips that gave them a firm grip on slippery branches and vines gradually smooth      and soften  they rose in amazement onto their hind legs and crept from shelter across the dazzling savannah  •   after a summer of twelve thousand years  after the interruptions of ice  after one particular inundation and the shadow of an ark darkening fishshoals as they scooted over hills and valleys  after the blaze of one civilization then another  after the destruction of several experiments with law and order  after the extinction of many beautiful languages  rain by and large found its place in the scheme of things  it began to defeat its purpose on the private sky of umbrellas  it babbled through long green fields and melted into the seams of poetry  it larked in the puddle of its many names  cobblers and chair legs and pipe stems  frogs and jugs and beards  cats and dogs  men  •   although they are shaped like a parachute thanks to the air pressure beneath them raindrops                     explode on landing  then the sun bears down again fitting his monocle into his eye  the glass flashes and burns  the rain sweats and evaporates into the ocean of its air  the ocean continues on its way continually overflowing here and there in quick little splashes or reckless floods and drenching  it is delicate or brutal  it is blue sometimes              and sometimes gray  sometimes it falls on bare rocks at others                     it raises large forests of leafing trees

 i close my eyes so that i can see it what we so freely eliminate who is  not guilty of it we reek of paper everywhere we go is paper our  hands are stained with paper walls what echoes from our walls  the sweet whisper of rainforest even the name makes the sound of  rushing water or perhaps it’s a ghost that haunts us they say the dead  that did not die a peaceful death are doomed forever to wander the earth  but perhaps this earth is for them already a cemeterystacks and  stacks of flesh on a desk which one belongs to which tree  already we’ve traded oxygen for so much

 the darkness draws me kindly angels weep forlorn beyond receding rings of light the torrents of the earth’s desires sweep my soul through twilight downward into night  once more the light grows dim the vision fades myself seems to myself a distant goal i grope among the bodies’ drowsy shades once more the old illusion rocks my soul  once more the manifold in shadowy streams of falling waters murmurs in my ears the one voice drowns amid the roar of dreams that crowd the narrow pathway of the years  i go to seek the starshine on thewaves to count the dewdrops on the grassy hill i go to gather flowers that grow on graves the world’s wall closes round my prisoned will  yea for the sake of the wild western wind the sphered spirit scorns her flamebuilt throne because of primroses time out of mind the lonely turns away from the alone  who once has loved the cornfield’s rustling sheaves who once has heard the gentle irish rain murmur low music in the growing leaves though he were god comes back to earth again  oh earth green windswept eirinn i would break the tower of my soul’s initiate pride for a gray field and a starhaunted lake and those wet winds that roam the country side  i who have seen am glad to close my eyes i who have soared am weary of my wings i seek no more the secret of the wise safe among shadowy unreal human things  blind to the gleam of those wild violet rays that burn beyond the rainbows circle dim bound by dark nights and driven by pale days the sightless slave of time’s imperious whim  deaf to the flowing tide of dreams divine that surge outside the closed gates of birth the rhythms of eternity too fine to touch with music the dull ears of earth  i go to seek with humble care and toil the dreams i left undreamed the deeds undone to sow the seed and break the stubborn soil knowing no brightness whiter than the sun  content in winter if the fire burns clear and cottage walls keep out the creeping damp hugging the old illusion warm and dear the silence and the wise book and the lamp

 the smashed weirdness of the raving cadenzas of god takes over all of a sudden in our time it speaks through the voices of talk show moderators  it tells us in a ringing anthem like heavenly hosts uplifted that the rhapsody of the pastoral is out to lunch we can take it from there  we can take it to easy street but when things get tough on easy street what then is it time for realism  and who are these guys on the bus who glide in golden hats past us on their way to kansas city

 argument  how a ship having passed the line was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole and how from thence she made her course to the tropical latitude of the great pacific ocean and of the strange things that befell and in what manner the ancyent marinere came back to his own country part i  it is an ancient mariner and he stoppeth one of three by thy long grey beard and glittering eye now wherefore stoppst thou me  the bridegrooms doors are opened wide and i am next of kin the guests are met the feast is set mayst hear the merry din  he holds him with his skinny hand there was a ship quoth he hold off unhand me greybeard loon eftsoons his hand dropt he  he holds him with his glittering eye the weddingguest stood still and listens like a three years child the mariner hath his will  the weddingguest sat on a stone he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the brighteyed mariner  the ship was cheered the harbour cleared merrily did we drop below the kirk below the hill below the lighthouse top  the sun came up upon the left out of the sea came he and he shone bright and on the right went down into the sea  higher and higher every day till over the mast at noon the weddingguest here beat his breast for he heard the loud bassoon  the bride hath paced into the hall red as a rose is she nodding their heads before her goes the merry minstrelsy  the weddingguest he beat his breast yet he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the brighteyed mariner  and now the stormblast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his oertaking wings and chased us south along  with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe and forward bends his head the ship drove fast loud roared the blast and southward aye we fled  and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice masthigh came floating by as green as emerald  and through the drifts the snowy clifts did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken the ice was all between  the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound  at length did cross an albatross thorough the fog it came as if it had been a christian soul we hailed it in gods name  it ate the food it neer had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with a thunderfit the helmsman steered us through  and a good south wind sprung up behind the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the mariners hollo  in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it perched for vespers nine whiles all the night through fogsmoke white glimmered the white moonshine  god save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus why lookst thou sowith my crossbow i shot the albatross  part ii  the sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist and on the left went down into the sea  and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or play came to the mariners hollo  and i had done a hellish thing and it would work em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow  nor dim nor red like gods own head the glorious sun uprist then all averred i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist  the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow followed free we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea  down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down twas sad as sad could be and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea  all in a hot and copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon  day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink  the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea  about about in reel and rout the deathfires danced at night the water like a witchs oils burnt green and blue and white  and some in dreams assurèd were of the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow  and every tongue through utter drought was withered at the root we could not speak no more than if we had been choked with soot  ah well aday what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung  part iii  there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye  when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky  at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist  a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a watersprite it plunged and tacked and veered  with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail  with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all  see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel  the western wave was all aflame the day was well nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun  and straight the sun was flecked with bars heavens mother send us grace as if through a dungeongrate he peered with broad and burning face  alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres  are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that womans mate  her lips were redher looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare lifeindeath was she who thicks mans blood with cold  the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice the game is done ive won ive won quoth she and whistles thrice  the suns rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with farheard whisper oer the sea off shot the spectrebark  we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my lifeblood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersmans face by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb above the eastern bar the hornèd moon with one bright star within the nether tip  one after one by the stardogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye  four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one  the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow  part iv  i fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the ribbed seasand  i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown fear not fear not thou weddingguest this body dropt not down  alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony  the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i  i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay  i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust  i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay dead like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet  the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away  an orphans curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is the curse in a dead mans eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die  the moving moon went up the sky and no where did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside  her beams bemocked the sultry main like april hoarfrost spread but where the ships huge shadow lay the charmèd water burnt alway a still and awful red  beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the watersnakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes  within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire  o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware  the selfsame moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea  part v  oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul  the silly buckets on the deck that had so long remained i dreamt that they were filled with dew and when i awoke it rained  my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank  i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so lightalmost i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost  and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere  the upper air burst into life and a hundred fireflags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between  and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain poured down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge  the thick black cloud was cleft and still the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide  the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan  they groaned they stirred they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise  the helmsman steered the ship moved on yet never a breeze upblew the mariners all gan work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools we were a ghastly crew  the body of my brothers son stood by me knee to knee the body and i pulled at one rope but he said nought to me  i fear thee ancient mariner be calm thou weddingguest twas not those souls that fled in pain which to their corses came again but a troop of spirits blest  for when it dawnedthey dropped their arms and clustered round the mast sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths and from their bodies passed  around around flew each sweet sound then darted to the sun slowly the sounds came back again now mixed now one by one  sometimes adropping from the sky i heard the skylark sing sometimes all little birds that are how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning  and now twas like all instruments now like a lonely flute and now it is an angels song that makes the heavens be mute  it ceased yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of june that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune  till noon we quietly sailed on yet never a breeze did breathe slowly and smoothly went the ship moved onward from beneath  under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it was he that made the ship to go the sails at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also  the sun right up above the mast had fixed her to the ocean but in a minute she gan stir with a short uneasy motion backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion  then like a pawing horse let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell down in a swound  how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declare but ere my living life returned i heard and in my soul discerned two voices in the air  is it he quoth one is this the man by him who died on cross with his cruel bow he laid full low the harmless albatross  the spirit who bideth by himself in the land of mist and snow he loved the bird that loved the man who shot him with his bow  the other was a softer voice as soft as honeydew quoth he the man hath penance done and penance more will do  part vi

 there’s a shadow over the city the light as usual framing and erasing  just say you dream fires each night smoothing each collapsing page from  the throat talking in a series of measures in the high desert  the perfect life in a series of measured gestures an invitation to  see the world from a bridge that burns in the next night

 god knows the law of life is death and you can feel it in your warbler neck your riverquick high stick wrist at the end of day but the trophies a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle a magpie dipping her wing tips in a white cloud an ouzel barreling hiphigh upstream with a warning you wish you had a river to make a river it takes some mountains some rain to watershed you wish you had a steady meadow and pink thistles bobbing at the border for your horizons pale robins bouncing their good postures in the spruce shadows instead the law of life comes for you like three men and a car in your dreams you win them over with your dreams a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle a magpie so slow she knows how to keep death at bay she takes her time with argument and hides her royal blue in black shy as a blue grouse nevertheless god doesn’t forget his green mountains you wish you had a river

 i shall foot it down the roadway in the dusk where shapes of hunger wander and the fugitives of pain go by  i shall foot it in the silence of the morning see the night slur into dawn hear the slow great winds arise where tall trees flank the way and shoulder toward the sky  the broken boulders by the road shall not commemorate my ruin regret shall be the gravel under foot i shall watch for slim birds swift of wing that go where wind and ranks of thunder drive the wild processionals of rain  the dust of the travelled road shall touch my hands and face

 they look like big strong hands don’t they  but for some they are eerily reminiscent of drunken stepfathers who didn’t listen abusive lovers who didn’t ask permission of bullies who never got to see the gold within ’cause they were too busy fracking the aether out of innocents  these bronze hands give people flashbacks of brass knuckles tall dark and sinister skip across their eyelids wary of their trinkets these hands look like they would snatch their children out of the night  fright in the eyes of a stranger is hard to chisel away so i choose to dispel the myths and preconceived notions  not all giants from the ocean are created violent some of us dream of violin solos while fumbling with a lack of nimble  sometimes these big strong hands are too small to cradle all these broken dreams  i hold them too close i suppose  the pitterpatter of shattered hopes on tattered heartstrings are a practiced tune these fingers sing  sometimes they make me a target so many napoléons want their volley to knock the nose off the sphinx so i meandered to the metamorphosis of these metacarpals into mandible munchers and it made me malignant  they look like big ol’ meat mashers don’t they  these boulders used to reduce mountains into molehills but though they once were warriors  these old soldiers gather moss now they’ve seen enough violence for two lifetimes and have since retired they beg forgiveness for sinning against their brothers and taking up arms against them  nobody ever asks me what i see ’cause to me they look like blame the big kid for defending himself against the antagonistic little shit with the chip on his shoulder  they look like these big digits won’t fit fingertip thimble kisses they look like highroller scapegoats and tactile regret  i know what they look like but they are  grandpa’s fissures filled with pride in combing my hair they’re grandma’s amethyst veins helping me cross cracked pavement they’re dad’s throwing discus my uncle’s shooting hoops my brothers playing music  regardless of what they look like my hands are large and powerful from a long line of love with no time for the presumptions of mice and men  my hands were trained by earth mothers who let ‘ōlelo hawai‘i roll thunder ’cross the valleys and echo from the cliffs  my granite palms are diamonds in the rough smooth enough to wipe away little streams from northern springs and put pressure on cuts to stop rivulets from leaking  my hands massage caress intertwine and heal move nimbly with knot work they tremble and quake they help me stand up straight  my hands can stand the heat  so that even while it’s still molten they will help shape the golden heart within the next mountain

 think of our blindness where the water burned are we so certain that those wings returned and turning we had half discerned before our dazzled eyes had surely seen the bird aloft there did not mean our hearts so seized upon the sign  think how we sailed upwind the brine tasting of daphne the enormous wave thundering in the water cave thunder in stone and how we beached the skiff and climbed the coral of that iron cliff and found what only in our hearts we’d heard the silver screaming of that one white bird the fabulous wings the crimson beak that opened red as blood to shriek and clamor in that world of stone no voice to answer but its own  what certainty hidden in our hearts before found in the bird its metaphor

 surprised by a frill of white flower where id never planted an eye i decided to fence it with sticks  and let the renegade live in undoctored soil where the garden gave way to volunteer poplars  and acidic white pine why not after all away from the tribe in clay where beetles drill  and weeds emerge inspired it might grow eccentric proliferate and thrive when autumn air  said disinter  to fill the bin for winter i troweled under and pulled the stem  until a rabble of rough spuds red as etruscan urns emerged as if to prove  that whatever urge drove the rogue to sow itself and strive beyond all cultivation  might offer a vital lesson to any apostate instinct aspiring to survive

 along the campo manin’s bronze winged lion prowled among the tanned intruders licking their hands pools of iridescent shellfish lay open in the restaurant window  a shop of otherworldly opals the mussels’ sheen the skies of a closed heaven crabs flat on their backs their armor intricate trapped plates and escapements the squid slumped in its own ink the octopus appalled  in its slime many and ingenious are the postures of death but look there in a corner beneath a willowware plate a lone crab clicked its claws creeping over a casket of walleyed fish  through a valley of oysters keeping their counsel only to shift warily under the shadow of a wine bottle which saint o saints watches over the saintly crab the man of forks and spears the man of arrows  in the ca’ d’oro the stiffened sebastian takes each arrow through his flesh like a skewer he wears a little napkin around his middle saint watch over the fragile boat of the runaway crab  let him steal his way back to the green lagoon go floating down the grand canal on his own motoscafo let him take second life a later martyrdom let him wave his bent claws in a mockery of farewell  lest we eat in his hollow shell his captive meat

 the bud stands for all things even for those things that don’t flower for everything flowers from within of selfblessing though sometimes it is necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch it is lovely until it flowers again from within of selfblessing as saint francis put his hand on the creased forehead of the sow and told her in words and in touch blessings of earth on the sow and the sow began remembering all down her thick length from the earthen snout all the way through the fodder and slops to the spiritual curl of the tail from the hard spininess spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart to the sheer blue milken dreaminess spurting and shuddering from the fourteen teats into the fourteen mouths sucking and blowing beneath them the long perfect loveliness of sow

 our ropes are the roots of our life we fish low in the earth the river beneath runs through our veins blue and cold in a riverbed  when the sun comes up the moon moves slowly to the left  i tie the logs and limbs together holding them in place  the ocean beats them smooth like rock here my sense of time is flat  i find in a strip of damp sand footprints and marks of hands and torn pieces of flesh  night is a beast the tide moves gushing back and forth  sunlight touches our faces turning us turning us turning us in our morning sleep   1976

 i’m wondering where you are now married or mad or free wherever you are you’re likely glad but memory troubles me  we could’ve had us children we could’ve had a home but you thought not and i thought not and these nine years we roam  today i worked in the deep dark tanks and climbed out to watch the sea gulls and salty waves pass by and mountains of araby  i’ve travelled the lonely oceans and wandered the lonely towns i’ve learned a lot and lost a lot and proved the world was round  now if we’d stayed together there’s much we’d never’ve known but dreary books and weary lands weigh on me like a stone indian ocean 1959

 natchez afternoon burns everything off franklin street even the birds even the flies  or icedtea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone into a doze all indoors in a cool  they said would never come eighty years ago when this was still the center of business  and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs ice in a highball and let each house  close its lids a while theyve kept their quiet so im alone before the windows  the radiant panes each with its scrim of clay the finish the river gives everything  so nothing not even glass is clear its almost painful this saturation  this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags bright and strange as a magazine photo  youd find in an attic or an antique store hard to believe the color was ever real  the teacups the painted china and jeweled eggs even the bottles medicine vials  and flasks each with its ounce of dirt even the smell of the prolific earth  the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs and oak armoires and mantles that survive  their tall white homes like the plantation house where later ill witness again  the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt that still feels like a dream where ill walk  out ofor is it intomyself the maitreds small solicitous voice  proffering another julepcottonleaf hand silver cupthough even he must be  a reenactment or a revenant a hanger for the clothes of memory  i will take it i would a handful of refuge in unthinking weather will take  the same lethargic joy in a breeze any chill in the throat any kind of shade  so i enter the dim of one old cotton house its airconditioned maze of handtools  and quilts corn cribs and cotton gins and of course the owners smile porcelain bright almost  blinding blooming in welcome and howyoudo and whatbringsyou we talk amid rows  of cookstoves stewpots and castiron skillets about the wedding ive come to see  on the famed estate the time the town exploded the rhythm clubs inferno and then  she ventures she knows the accent knows im from alabama and soon shes eloquent  on our lakes and rivers where the mister takes her every chance they get shes seen it all  so she asks where im from and when i say she starts to glow gushing over mountains  all the way to gatlinburg shes walked each one even skied the states one slope which conjures  not the southern snow that required almost everything around us but snow cold snow a thought  that cools me further so my sweat is nearly dry when the smile tightens across her teeth  and she leans in to say ijust love it you knowthere are no darkies there  then afternoon is a conspiracy of color an echo the heat or the history  in our voices draws us into someone elses version of ourselves  and the inevitable painful quiet in which an answer must arrive  what can you say and how long do you have to wait before you can leave before you can walk  out of yourself and down the cottontrading streets into the smother of trees  on some more recent lane how long do you have to wait before you can leave and not be followed  and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds drown in bass and drum and anger  before you can cross back into the proper century the smell of the river stays with you  maybe even grows as you move so you dont know where youre going and the key in your hand  could open a car door or a plantation room or nothing at all some door thats vanished  in the air junes shimmer from the asphalt and the roofs of every house so you walk  toward that moment when the sun starts burning and the magnolias thick perfume washes  all around and you find yourself on a corner all linen and sweat again the only one  whod walk in a heat like this you have no idea where you are so you cock your head  as if you might hear your way through the afternoon and when you raise your head you see  across the street two men hunched in shadow on a barbershops stoop ties  dangling like smoke in the solid air theyve seen you and now their brows sharpen  as if they know too youre not from here and in the space between you anything  could pass the ghosts of farragut or grant or a hot white caddy rattling new orleans bounce  youre waiting to see it seems like years or centuries then one rises ties his tie and steps back in  leaving the other who keeps your eye a moment longer then looks into the distance  through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air for something far behind you something  you dont even know how to look for something that may never arrive

 the whiskey stink of rot has settled in the garden and a burst of fruit flies rises when i touch the dying tomato plants  still the claws of tiny yellow blossoms flail in the air as i pull the vines up by the roots and toss them in the compost  it feels cruel something in me isn’t ready to let go of summer so easily to destroy what i’ve carefully cultivated all these months those pale flowers might still have time to fruit  my greatgrandmother sang with the girls of her village as they pulled the flax songs so old and so tied to the season that the very sound seemed to turn the weather

 there were bees about from the start i thought the day was apt to hurt there is a high hill of sand behind the sea and the kids were dropping from the top of it like schools of fish over falls cracking skulls on skulls i knew the holiday was hot i saw the august sun teeming in the bodies logged along the beach and felt the yearning in the brightly covered parts turning each to each for lunch i bit the olive meat a yellow jacket stung me on the tongue i knelt to spoon and suck the healing sea  a little girl was digging up canals with her toes her arm hanging in a cast as white as the belly of a dead fish whose dead eye looked at her with me as she opened her grotesque system to the sea  i walked away now quietly i heard a child moaning from a low mound of sand abandoned by his friend the child was tricked trapped upon his knees in a shallow pit the older ones will say you can get out i dug him up his legs would not unbend i lifted him and held him in my arms as he wept oh i was gnarled as a witch or warlock by his naked weight was slowed in the sand to a thief’s gait when his strength flowed he ran and i rested by the sea  a girl was there i saw her drop her hair let it fall from the doffed cap to her breasts tanned and swollen over wine red woolen a boy his body blackened by the sun rose out of the sand stripping down his limbs with graceful hands he took his gear and walked toward the girl in the brown hair and wine and then past me he brushed her with the soft brilliant monster he lugged into the sea  by this tide i raised a small cairn of stone light and smooth and clean and cast the shadow of a stick in a perfect line along the sand my own shadow followed then until i felt the cold swirling at the groin

 three years ago in the afternoons i used to sit back here and try to answer the simple arithmetic of my life but never could figure it this object and that object never contained the landscape nor all of its implications this tree and that shrub never completely satisfied the sum or quotient i took from or carried to nor do they do so now though im back here again looking to calculate looking to see what adds up  everything comes from something only something comes from nothing lao tzu says more or less eminently sensible i say rubbing this tiny snail shell between my thumb and two fingers delicate as an earring it carries its emptiness like a child it would be rid of i rub it clockwise and counterclockwise hoping for anything resplendent in its vocabulary or disguise but one and one make nothing he adds endless and everywhere the shadow that everything casts

 if you refuse me once and think again i will complain you are deceiv’d love is no work of art it must be got and born not made and worn by every one that hath a heart  or do you think they more than once can die whom you deny who tell you of a thousand deaths a day like the old poets feign and tell the pain they met but in the common way  or do you think ’t too soon to yield and quit the field nor is that right they yield that first entreat once one may crave for love but more would prove this heart too little that too great  oh that i were all soul that i might prove for you as fit a love as you are for an angel for i know none but pure spirits are fit loves for you  you are all ethereal there’s in you no dross nor any part that’s gross your coarsest part is like a curious lawn the vestal relics for a covering drawn  your other parts part of the purest fire that e’er heav’n did inspire makes every thought that is refin’d by it a quintessence of goodness and of wit  thus have your raptures reach’d to that degree in love’s philosophy that you can figure to yourself a fire void of all heat a love without desire  nor in divinity do you go less you think and you profess that souls may have a plenitude of joy although their bodies meet not to employ  but i must needs confess i do not find the motions of my mind so purified as yet but at the best my body claims in them an interest  i hold that perfect joy makes all our parts as joyful as our hearts our senses tell us if we please not them our love is but a dotage or a dream  how shall we then agree you may descend but will not to my end i fain would tune my fancy to your key but cannot reach to that obstructed way  there rests but this that whilst we sorrow here our bodies may draw near and when no more their joys they can extend then let our souls begin where they did end

 full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with alltriumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath maskd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

 why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds o’ertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke ‘tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss the offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offence’s cross ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

 while one sere leaf that parting autumn yields trembles upon the thin and naked spray november dragging on this sunless day lours cold and sullen on the watery fields and nature to the waste dominion yields stripped her last robes with gold and purple gay  so droops my life of your soft beams despoiled youth health and hope that long exulting smiled and the wild carols and the bloomy hues of merry springtime spruce on every plain her halfblown bushes moist with sunny rain more pensive thoughts in my sunk heart infuse than winter’s grey and desolate domain faded like my lost youth that no bright spring renews

 i wonder about the trees why do we wish to bear forever the noise of these more than another noise so close to our dwelling place we suffer them by the day till we lose all measure of pace and fixity in our joys and acquire a listening air they are that that talks of going but never gets away and that talks no less for knowing as it grows wiser and older that now it means to stay my feet tug at the floor and my head sways to my shoulder sometimes when i watch trees sway from the window or the door i shall set forth for somewhere i shall make the reckless choice some day when they are in voice and tossing so as to scare the white clouds over them on i shall have less to say but i shall be gone

 who is speaking our correspondent on the hill above the river making pictures for exhibition in other places each stroke of his pen ricochets across the valley he sees what he wants to see he does not hear what he cannot see a smoking ruin behind him another  waiting just around the bendairy particulates  a path leads from the pa to a ford of the river hard by which was that traversed by the raiders on their return nothing was heard but the occasional yell until about 8 pm when we could again distinctly hear the yells repeated and then all was again quiet save the sentinels’ “all’s well” was it seems waha mouth  the stream at this spot is about 90 yards wide and its depth is about 3 feet then a shout of “stand to your arms” which was followed by a heavy volley from the rebels who set up a most unearthly yell wavering with two hearts  the south bank is flat and low and on that side there is a good deal of marsh they were full of determination and at times came within speaking distance inviting our men to come on who replied by recommending them to stand out led the women in resisting the survey  the north bank is high and steep and its precipitous sides are clothed with karaka and fern trees whose luxuriant foliage thickly matted with the vine and parasite plants which grow there in abundance forms a sort of vegetable wall several old women were vociferous in encouraging the enemy to get shellfish from the reef  the landscape is extremely pretty they were blowing their horns and shouting for a long time and in the morning it was found that the sap rollers had disappeared and also a quantity of gabions this white flag is not an emblem of peace  the camp shows above the windings of the river which pursues its tortuous course over a shingly bed and is lost to view in the distance all the peach trees karaka trees where the picnic parties used to go have been cut down a comet west northwest portending  the sun shining on the white tops of the tents renders their outline particularly distinct every time a shell is thrown they set up a general howl of defiance followed by such challenges as “come on pakeha” “come on  soldier  come on” left on the ground for the pigs and sea gulls karoro  in the distance the sea presents an unvaried unbroken line and the snowy peak of the mountain to the left adds considerably to the scene during the night they contented themselves by wasting on us all the bad epithets and evil wishes their language is capable of “a mate noa” till death  the road down to the ford on the north bank is very steep insomuch that it is a necessary precaution to dismount and lead a horse they have several blowing horns by means of which they mimic our bugle sounds these horns are heard both day and night and it is probable that they have certain established calls which they all understand and adopt on particular occasions wrote his name on a tub  the raiders however managed to get their bullock drays up to the top but it is presumed they were empty and that their contents must have been brought up by hand on monday night the guard in no 8 redoubt were entertained until about 2 o’clock by hapurona who was urging his people most vehemently to attack them and said they were very weak in it he said the governor had done him all sorts of injury and that he would scatter our bones over the waitara a blue shirt braided with scarlet  the ground about the pa is tolerably clear and it is in part intersected by fences several of the men in the redoubt knew his voice and what he said quite well being covered with myriads of empty cartridge cases  a solitary canoe was found half full of water near the ford during the night voices heard on our right that of a woman being most conspicuous she was endeavoring to incite the people to some desperate action by relating the deeds of her forebears being pouri grieved  how do they sound drifting back to him there on the side of the road down by the river or along the beach a group of riders coming the other way a group the artist did not catch in his notebook and they were gone before he thought to turn around and look after their retreating voices top hat and sidesaddle onaero urenui waiiti pukearuhe

 people are putting up storm windows now or were this morning until the heavy rain drove them indoors so coming home at noon i saw storm windows lying on the ground framefull of rain through the water and glass i saw the crushed grass how it seemed to stream away in lines like seaweed on the tide or blades of wheat leaning under the wind the ripple and splash of rain on the blurred glass seemed that it briefly said as i walked by something i should have liked to say to you something  the dry grass bent under the pane brimful of bouncing water  something of a swaying clarity which blindly echoes this lonely afternoon of memories and missed desires while the wintry rain unspeakable the distance in the mind runs on the standing windows and away

 after thomas james the strangers in the woods must mimic squirrels and crackle with the undergrowth they must not flinch at the cruelty of breaking golden leaves with their feet or of interring stones and like any of these deciduous trees in autumn they must be  stingy with shadow and move deceptively across the sludge i listen to these strangers stirring with the evenings i invent paths for them to the soft edge of the lake each descent is as graceful as a sinking ship but less tragic somehow because these strangers  don’t possess a lung i cannot hear them breathe yet the air is all whispers all sighsthe same ethereal muscle that rubs the color off the foliage i lost my way out of the woods on the night every bird went south or numb a plump rat snatched the moon  and dragged it by the white rope of its tail the strangers were a cloak of silhouettes flattening against a trunk like bark i must have disappeared among them because the mouth i touched was not my own and was cruelly closing in on someone’s rib i carried  such a bite on me an arc of green and yellow on my side from the man who said he loved me in that darkness i knew as much about him as i did of the amputee swimming his way up the hill with his only arm so this is the home of the unturned stone where  the fugitive keeps his kiss archeologists will discover a paradise in the place no touch died of neglect is it any wonder all things forgotten or abandoned find their way here the winter is back so too the bloated body of a book i tossed over the bridge last week  and there on the bench is my old smoking habit a cigarette glowing on my mouth like a beacon i’m patient waiting for the fugitive to claim me as his own i’m as wise as any stranger here alone but with the knowledge that the grief of separation is always brief

 when clouds turn heavy rich and mottled as an oyster bed  when the temperature drops so fast that fog conjures itself inside the cars as if the parking lots were filled with row upon row of lovers  when my umbrella veils my face and threatens to reverse itself at every gust of wind and rain lashes my legs and the hem of my skirt  but i am walking to meet a man who’ll buy me coffee and kiss my fingers  what can be more beautiful then than these boys sprinting through the storm laughing shouldering the rain aside running to their dorms perhaps to class carrying like torches their useless shoes

 excerpt ’tis morning and the sun with ruddy orb ascending fires the horizon while the clouds that crowd away before the driving wind more ardent as the disk emerges more resemble most some city in a blaze seen through the leafless wood  his slanting ray slides ineffectual down the snowy vale and tinging all with his own rosy hue from ev’ry herb and ev’ry spiry blade stretches a length of shadow o’er the field mine spindling into longitude immense in spite of gravity and sage remark that i myself am but a fleeting shade provokes me to a smile  with eye askance i view the muscular proportion’d limb transform’d to a lean shank  the shapeless pair as they design’d to mock me at my side take step for step and as i near approach the cottage walk along the plaster’d wall prepost’rous sight the legs without the man the verdure of the plain lies buried deep beneath the dazzling deluge and the bents and coarser grass upspearing o’er the rest of late unsightly and unseen now shine conspicuous and in bright apparel clad and fledg’d with icy feathers nod superb the cattle mourn in corners where the fence screens them and seem half petrified to sleep in unrecumbent sadness  there they wait their wonted fodder not like hung’ring man fretful if unsupply’d but silent meek and patient of the slowpac’d swain’s delay he from the stack carves out th’ accustom’d load deepplunging and again deep plunging oft his broad keen knife into the solid mass smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands with such undeviating and even force he severs it away no needless care lest storms should overset the leaning pile deciduous or its own unbalanc’d weight      ’tis liberty alone that gives the flow’r of fleeting life its lustre and perfume and we are weeds without it  all constraint except what wisdom lays on evil men is evil hurts the faculties impedes their progress in the road of science blinds the eyesight of discov’ry and begets in those that suffer it a sordid mind bestial a meagre intellect unfit to be the tenant of man’s noble form thee therefore still blameworthy as thou art with all thy loss of empire and though squeez’d by public exigence till annual food fails for the craving hunger of the state thee i account still happy and the chief among the nations seeing thou art free my native nook of earth      but there is yet a liberty unsung by poets and by senators unprais’d which monarchs cannot grant nor all the powers of earth and hell confed’rate take away a liberty which persecution fraud oppression prisons have no pow’r to bind which whoso tastes can be enslav’d no more ’tis liberty of heart deriv’d from heav’n bought with his blood who gave it to mankind and seal’d with the same token  it is held by charter and that charter sanction’d sure by th’ unimpeachable and awful oath and promise of a god  his other gifts all bear the royal stamp that speaks them his and are august but this transcends them all

 beautiful railway bridge of the silv’ry tay alas i am very sorry to say that ninety lives have been taken away on the last sabbath day of 1879 which will be remember’d for a very long time  ’twas about seven o’clock at night and the wind it blew with all its might and the rain came pouring down and the dark clouds seem’d to frown and the demon of the air seem’d to say “i’ll blow down the bridge of tay”  when the train left edinburgh the passengers’ hearts were light and felt no sorrow but boreas blew a terrific gale which made their hearts for to quail and many of the passengers with fear did say “i hope god will send us safe across the bridge of tay”  but when the train came near to wormit bay boreas he did loud and angry bray and shook the central girders of the bridge of tay on the last sabbath day of 1879 which will be remember’d for a very long time  so the train sped on with all its might and bonnie dundee soon hove in sight and the passengers’ hearts felt light thinking they would enjoy themselves on the new year with their friends at home they lov’d most dear and wish them all a happy new year  so the train mov’d slowly along the bridge of tay until it was about midway then the central girders with a crash gave way and down went the train and passengers into the tay the storm fiend did loudly bray because ninety lives had been taken away on the last sabbath day of 1879 which will be remember’d for a very long time  as soon as the catastrophe came to be known the alarm from mouth to mouth was blown and the cry rang out all o’er the town good heavens the tay bridge is blown down and a passenger train from edinburgh which fill’d all the people’ hearts with sorrow and made them for to turn pale because none of the passengers were sav’d to tell the tale how the disaster happen’d on the last sabbath day of 1879 which will be remember’d for a very long time  it must have been an awful sight to witness in the dusky moonlight while the storm fiend did laugh and angry did bray along the railway bridge of the silv’ry tay oh illfated bridge of the silv’ry tay i must now conclude my lay by telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay that your central girders would not have given way at least many sensible men do say had they been supported on each side with buttresses at least many sensible men confesses for the stronger we our houses do build the less chance we have of being killed

 and then came the ten moons full in the sun’s glare and the seraphim and it was light all night in the orchards and on the plains and even in the towns and mankind rejoiced because it was now the case that the wrecking and equivocating could carry on the pale night long mankind rejoiced and went forth to those places twelve hours of light had not made it worth the while to despoil and gamboled collectively on the cliff tops and regarded the nightbroiling of the sea hitherto forbidden but now opened in festival half the world’s time unpeeled and exposed so fruit might ripen faster and trees flourish higher and forced photosynthesis green all the land then night ramblers nightsunworshippers nightmotorists fanned out and made the most of spectral light which bleached out stars and even the cozy old moon herself who had once held a sickle broadside to the sun and now was a hollow daytime shadow only a few old believers slept hand in hand shoulder to breast as if their lives depended on it knowing yet that the morning would bring nothing because the day knew no beginning and had no end

 for nathaniel 19001968 all afternoon you worked at cutting them down branch after branch tossed into the heap you had your ceremony old pants the pipe the pipe rested in the cleft of the tree when the pile got big enough you threw the kerosene  now the woods are clouded again you forgot the world could be this messy air thickens into leaves the leaves into worms behind the barn overnight it seems tents have spread out in the apple trees  there’s work for you so you come back in your pants old as dirt with a pipe heavy as stone no time to lose whatever is rotten whatever won’t hold the weight of another season you hack down there’s one moment though  when you feel almost sorry for them the tents break into flame and the small black pieces of anguish crawl out into the grass those that get away well you let them get away this time

 that child was dangerous that justborn newly washed and silent baby wrapped in deerskin and held warm against the side of its mother could understand the language of birds and animals even when asleep it knew why bluejay was scolding the bushes what hawk was explaining to the wind on the cliffside what bittern had found out while standing alone in marsh grass it knew what the screams of fox and the whistling of otter were telling the forest that child knew the language of fire as it gnawed at sticks like beaver and what water said all day and all night at the creeks mouth as its small fingers closed around stone it held what stone was saying it knew what bear mother whispered to herself under the snow it could not tell anyone what it knew it would laugh or cry out or startle or suddenly stare at nothing but had no way to repeat what it was hearing what it wanted most not to remember it had no way to know why it would fall under a spell and lie still as if not breathing having grown afraid of what it could understand that child would learn to sit and crawl and stand and begin putting one foot forward and following it with the other would learn to put one word it could barely remember slightly ahead of the other and then walk and speak and finally run and chatter and all the tillamook would know that child had forgotten everything and at last could listen only to people and was safe now

 they call the mountain carlos because it is brown though its purple slopes at dusk suggest other names those who name it have to brand the earth with something they know  a name a face even the heat that says i know carlos and he is the mountain i am going to cover his eyes in light they call its peak carlos because it is the sharpest feature on the face that stares south watching people cross the border pausing to catch their breath and meet the cliffs of carlos because he is there  when they ascend the canyons inside the face carlos shifts and the climbers discover what he has done the moving earth changes everything and they are forced to stop playing the game of naming a mountain that keeps touching the sun

 what happened is we grew lonely living among the things so we gave the clock a face the chair a back the table four stout legs which will never suffer fatigue  we fitted our shoes with tongues as smooth as our own and hung tongues inside bells so we could listen to their emotional language  and because we loved graceful profiles the pitcher received a lip the bottle a long slender neck  even what was beyond us was recast in our image we gave the country a heart the storm an eye the cave a mouth so we could pass into safety

 1  it is calm it is as though we lived in a garden that had not yet arrived at the knowledge of good and evil but there is a man in it   2  there will be rain falling vertically from an indifferent sky there will stare out from behind its bars the face of the man who is not enjoying it   3  nothing higher than a blackberry bush as the sun comes up fresh what is the darkness stretching from horizon to horizon it is the shadow here of the forked man   4  we have eaten the blackberries and spat out the seeds but they lie glittering like the eyes of a man   5  after we have stopped singing the garden is disturbed by echoes it is the man whistling expecting everything to come to him   6  we wipe our beaks on the branches wasting the dawn’s jewellery to get rid of the taste of a man   7  neverthless which is not the case with a man our bills give us no trouble   8  who said the number was unlucky it was a man who trying to pass us had his licence endorsed thirteen times   9  in the cool of the day the garden seems given over to blackbirds yet we know also that somewhere there is a man in hiding   10  to us there are eggs and there are blackbirds but there is the man too trying without feathers to incubate a solution   11  we spread our wings reticulating our airspace a man stands under us and worries at his ability to do the same   12  when night comes like a visitor from outer space we stop our ears lest we should hear tell of the man in the moon   13  summer is at an end the migrants depart when they return in spring to the garden will there be a man among them

 the fields are infertile as far as i can tell their winter systems sparkle like the diamonds that pelt neptune  limpid silvers reflect in the dark museums and theaters back in town  to them we run to elevate our eyes to a wellshaped ethics colors are supplied by our nervous minds  •  towards a just and invisible image behind each substance and its place in a sentence you must have been walking  welldefended best when lost from wanting  be like grass she told me lie flat spring up  •  we drop the shadows where they are then return to them when the light has grown heavy  you’ll take your time lugging the weight into our room or stand over there in the shade  we’ve never been too sure that we exist as the earth does we’re most at home in water that soaks up the letters in our brains  it could be we have been dry too long  a spirit is a mess when excess spoils it  •  i see them through the slats and crack of the open window a cold rain leaves flipped and palsied  the river is brown near the sand loose banks and twigs stick at the edge and a lilac’s silhouette of a child i love   how in the dark hole can i hide if   i can’t get outside   then i won’t remember what i did to deserve it   that arch and bridge will form a shape of repentance  if  i’m hanging then judgment has been passed  and i am hanging  upside down head swinging towards the moon  years of  inversion a face in a mirror displaced by its position outside silver  and so next will come muscle a little grief   but no shoulder  •  you’re learning how to be a unit with an infinite in its attic  it’s not difficult  light is the last message   white streaks like oil paint are the first to appear along the wet railing  next similar colors correspond by chance   we would rather be die with total strangers than with partial ones we realized in the elevator going down it was the only time that day that we were as alone as we were awake   sensing a just and impartial ghost close to each living thing i could see the genius  of  institutional religion examine your conscience confess in darkness and take away a task  soon you’ll wash off flesh scented by its parallel past what were your feet thinking in their hurry to connect the parts  get the children to the other side what children you were the one running  there was never any other

 how changed is here each spot man makes or fills in the two hinkseys nothing keeps the same the village street its haunted mansion lacks and from the sign is gone sibyllas name and from the roofs the twisted chimneystacks are ye too changed ye hills see tis no foot of unfamiliar men tonight from oxford up your pathway strays here came i often often in old days thyrsis and i we still had thyrsis then  runs it not here the track by childsworth farm past the high wood to where the elmtree crowns the hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames the signalelm that looks on ilsley downs the vale the three lone weirs the youthful thames this wintereve is warm humid the air leafless yet soft as spring the tender purple spray on copse and briers and that sweet city with her dreaming spires she needs not june for beautys heightening  lovely all times she lies lovely tonight only methinks some loss of habits power befalls me wandering through this upland dim once passd i blindfold here at any hour now seldom come i since i came with him that single elmtree bright against the westi miss it is it goner we prized it dearly while it stood we said our friend the gipsyscholar was not dead while the tree lived he in these fields lived on  too rare too rare grow now my visits here but once i knew each field each flower each stick and with the countryfolk acquaintance made by barn in threshingtime by newbuilt rick here too our shepherdpipes we first assayd ah me this many a year my pipe is lost my shepherds holiday needs must i lose them needs with heavy heart into the world and wave of men depart but thyrsis of his own will went away  it irkd him to be here he could not rest he loved each simple joy the country yields he loved his mates but yet he could not keep for that a shadow lourd on the fields here with the shepherds and the silly sheep some life of men unblest he knew which made him droop and filld his head he went his piping took a troubled sound of storms that rage outside our happy ground he could not wait their passing he is dead  so some tempestuous morn in early june when the years primal burst of bloom is oer before the roses and the longest day when gardenwalks and all the grassy floor with blossoms red and white of fallen may and chestnutflowers are strewn so have i heard the cuckoos parting cry from the wet field through the vext gardentrees come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze the bloom is gone and with the bloom go i   too quick despairer wherefore wilt thou go soon will the high midsummer pomps come on soon will the musk carnations break and swell soon shall we have golddusted snapdragon sweetwilliam with his homely cottagesmell and stocks in fragrant blow roses that down the alleys shine afar and open jasminemuffled lattices and groups under the dreaming gardentrees and the full moon and the white eveningstar  he hearkens not light comer he is flown what matters it next year he will return and we shall have him in the sweet springdays with whitening hedges and uncrumpling fern and bluebells trembling by the forestways and scent of hay newmown but thyrsis never more we swains shall see see him come back and cut a smoother reed and blow a strain the world at last shall heed for time not corydon hath conquerd thee  alack for corydon no rival now but when sicilian shepherds lost a mate some good survivor with his flute would go piping a ditty sad for bions fate and cross the unpermitted ferrys flow and relax plutos brow and make leap up with joy the beauteous head of proserpine among whose crowned hair are flowers first opend on sicilian air and flute his friend like orpheus from the dead  o easy access to the hearers grace when dorian shepherds sang to proserpine for she herself had trod sicilian fields she knew the dorian waters gush divine she knew each lily white which enna yields each rose with blushing face she loved the dorian pipe the dorian strain but ah of our poor thames she never heard her foot the cumner cowslips never stirrd and we should tease her with our plaint in vain  well winddispersed and vain the words will be yet thyrsis let me give my grief its hour in the old haunt and find our treetoppd hill who if not i for questing here hath power i know the wood which hides the daffodil i know the fyfield tree i know what white what purple fritillaries the grassy harvest of the riverfields above by ensham down by sandford yields and what sedged brooks are thamess tributaries  i know these slopes who knows them if not i but many a tingle on the loved hillside with thorns once studded old whiteblossomd trees where thick the cowslips grew and far descried high towerd the spikes of purple orchises hath since our day put by the coronals of that forgotten time down each green bank hath gone the ploughboys team and only in the hidden brookside gleam primroses orphans of the flowery prime  where is the girl who by the boatmans door above the locks above the boating throng unmoord our skiff when through the wytham flats red loosestrife and blond meadowsweet among and darting swallows and light watergnats we trackd the shy thames shore where are the mowers who as the tiny swell of our boat passing heaved the rivergrass stood with suspended scythe to see us pass they all are gone and thou art gone as well  yes thou art gone and round me too the night in evernearing circle weaves her shade i see her veil draw soft across the day i feel her slowly chilling breath invade the cheek grown thin the brown hair sprent with grey i feel her finger light laid pausefully upon lifes headlong train  the foot less prompt to meet the morning dew the heart less bounding at emotion new and hope once crushd less quick to spring again  and long the way appears which seemd so short to the less practised eye of sanguine youth and high the mountaintops in cloudy air the mountaintops where is the throne of truth tops in lifes morningsun so bright and bare unbreachable the fort of the longbatterd world uplifts its wall and strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows and near and real the charm of thy repose and night as welcome as a friend would fall  but hush the upland hath a sudden loss of quietlook adown the dusk hillside a troop of oxford hunters going home as in old days jovial and talking ride from hunting with the berkshire hounds they come quick let me fly and cross into yon farther fieldtis done and see backd by the sunset which doth glorify the orange and pale violet eveningsky bare on its lonely ridge the tree the tree  i take the omen eve lets down her veil the white fog creeps from bush to bush about the west unflushes the high stars grow bright and in the scatterd farms the lights come out i cannot reach the signaltree tonight yet happy omen hail hear it from thy broad lucent arnovale for there thine earth forgetting eyelids keep the morningless and unawakening sleep under the flowery oleanders pale  hear it o thyrsis still our tree is there ah vain these english fields this upland dim these brambles pale with mist engarlanded that lone skypointing tree are not for him to a boon southern country he is fled and now in happier air wandering with the great mothers train divine and purer or more subtle soul than thee i trow the mighty mother doth not see within a folding of the apennine  thou hearest the immortal chants of old putting his sickle to the perilous grain in the hot cornfield of the phrygian king for thee the lityersessong again young daphnis with his silver voice doth sing sings his sicilian fold his sheep his hapless love his blinded eyes and how a call celestial round him rang and heavenward from the fountainbrink he sprang and all the marvel of the golden skies  there thou art gone and me thou leavest here sole in these fields yet will i not despair despair i will not while i yet descry neath the mild canopy of english air that lonely tree against the western sky still still these slopes tis clear our gipsyscholar haunts outliving thee fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay woods with anemonies in flower till may know him a wanderer still then why not me  a fugitive and gracious light he seeks shy to illumine and i seek it too this does not come with houses or with gold with place with honour and a flattering crew tis not in the worlds market bought and sold but the smoothslipping weeks drop by and leave its seeker still untired out of the heed of mortals he is gone he wends unfollowd he must house alone yet on he fares by his own heart inspired  thou too o thyrsis on like quest wast bound thou wanderedst with me for a little hour men gave thee nothing but this happy quest if men esteemd thee feeble gave thee power if men procured thee trouble gave thee rest and this rude cumner ground its firtopped hurst its farms its quiet fields here camst thou in thy jocund youthful time here was thine height of strength thy golden prime and still the haunt beloved a virtue yields  what though the music of thy rustic flute kept not for long its happy country tone lost it too soon and learnt a stormy note of men contentiontost of men who groan which taskd thy pipe too sore and tired thy throat it faild and thou wage mute yet hadst thou always visions of our light and long with men of care thou couldst not stay and soon thy foot resumed its wandering way left human haunt and on alone till night  too rare too rare grow now my visits here mid citynoise not as with thee of yore thyrsis in reach of sheepbells is my home then through the great towns harsh heartwearying roar let in thy voice a whisper often come to chase fatigue and fear why faintest thou i wanderd till i died  roam on the light we sought is shining still  dost thou ask proof our tree yet crowns the hill  our scholar travels yet the loved hillside

 the tigerwoman came to me when dusk was close and men were dull she beckoned from the junglepath i followed dreaming fanciful  the tigerwoman’s face is pale but oh her speaking eyes are dark no beast can move so lithe as she beside the matted river’s mark  the jungle is a fearsome place for men who hunt and men who slay but i was not afraid to go where tigerwoman led the way  the tigerwoman’s lips are thin her teeth are like the tiger’s teeth yet her soft hands are woman’s hands and oh the blood beats warm beneath  she led me to a little glade the creepers with the moon inwove and two great striped beasts leaped up and fawned upon her breast in love  the tigerwoman’s voice was sweet i hearkened and was not afraid she stroked the tigers’ fearful jaws upon their heads my hands i laid  and all the jungle things drew near and all the leaves a music made like spirits chanting in a choir along the bamboo colonnade  too sweet for human harps to sound it touched my blood it fired my heart the tigerwoman sang and i sang too and understood her art  she kissed the tiger’s snarling mouth she kissedi marveled that she could but now her lips were warm on mine i cared not they were dabbed with blood  what if the traveller shuns my hut what if the world forgets to be what if i have the tiger’s heart the tigerwoman loveth me

 people like to mock my town they mock it for being too provincial and too boring and it’s true not much of import happens here but i don’t mind some people say when they are asked what they like about palmerston north that you can always find a park and that’s true too you can always find a park just a short walk from where you want to go sometimes right outside you don’t have to walk at all you’re right there of course only people who live in new zealand mock palmerston north as people who live outside new zealand know nothing about it people who don’t live in new zealand mock our entire little country as a 1950s throwback with honest rural folk and unspoilt scenery which isn’t quite true our scenery is spoilt from being looked at too often and freedom campers they say are a problem but me i blame dairy cows when i lived in the uk people there thought new zealand was a state of australia and they would ask me what was coming up on neighbours thinking i had some kind of inside knowledge but the truth is i don’t even watch neighbours or indeed any soap operas actually the whole southern hemisphere is more or less written off by people who don’t live here as somewhere elsewhere insignificant like palmerston north where as i said nothing much happens and it’s an undeniable fact that the magazines i subscribe to come from exotic places that they flaunt in their titles magazines like the new yorker and london review of books and the paris review but not the palmerston northerner it’s another fact that the paris review isn’t even published in paris and has nothing to say about that city but it has insightful interviews with famous writers some of whom i have read i have been to paris and apart from the architecture and the food and some very fine cemeteries and of course the language it’s quite like palmerston north though parking is a nightmare i never visited the louvre but one fine afternoon i went to the musée d’orsay which in the opinion of many educated people really is just as good if you like impressionist and postimpressionist art which i do still it was nice to come home again home to palmerston north new zealand and to see the good brown manawatū river moving sluggishly under the bridge it’s not the seine but water is water paul celan threw himself  odd phrase as if he were both baseball and pitcher  into the seine john cleese said palmerston north is the suicide capital of new zealand yet you don’t hear of people throwing themselves into the manawatū which would be a risky business but only because of the effluent from those dairy cows leaching into the river we live on a floodplain and the river is ever in our thoughts and sometimes our houses at such times we are downcast but we lift up our eyes unto the hills and the windmills perched on them that turn and turn one time i saw a middleaged woman in the plaza our only shopping mall with her head tilted to where the sky would have been but for the ceiling and the mood lighting a stout middleaged woman with black mascara elegantly dressed her wet mouth a dark soundless o and the crowd not unsympathetically parting and reforming around her  rock in the river  noticing and not noticing which is our way

 and at the picnic table under the ancient elms one of my parents turned to me and said “we hope you end up here” where the shade relieves the light where we sit  in some beneficenceand i felt the shape of the finite  after my ether life the ratio in all dappling of dark to bright and yet how brief my stay would be under the trees because the voice i’d heard could not cradle me could no longer keep me in greenery and i would have to say goodbye again make my way across the white california sand and back or am i now creating the helplessness i heard those words express the psalm torn like a map in my hands

 the weight of a man on a woman is like falling into the river without drowning  above the world is burning and fighting lost worlds flow through others  but down here beneath water’s skin river floor sand everything  is floating rocking water falls through our hands as we fall through it  and when a woman and a man come up from water they stand at the elemental edge of difference  mirrored on water’s skin they are fired clay water evaporating into air  they are where water turns away from land and goes back to enter a larger sea  a man and a woman are like those rivers entering a larger sea  greater than the sum of all its parts

 we have all seen them circling pastures have looked up from the mouth of a barn a pine clearing the fences of our own backyards and have stood amazed by the one slow wing beat the endless dihedral drift but i had never seen so many so close hundreds every limb of the dead oak feathered black  and i cut the engine let the river grab the jon boat and pull it toward the tree the black leaves shined the pink fruit blossomed red ugly as a human heart then as i passed under their dream i saw for the first time its soft countenance the raw fleshy jowls wrinkled and generous like the faces of the very old who have grown to empathize with everything  and i drifted away from them slow on the pull of the river reluctant looking back at their roost calling them what id never called them what they are those dwarfed transfiguring angels who flock to the side of the poisoned fox the mud turtle crushed on the shoulder of the road who pray over the leafgraves of the anonymous lost with mercy enough to consume us all and give us wings

 the village life and every care that reigns oer youthful peasants and declining swains what labour yields and what that labour past age in its hour of languor finds at last what forms the real picture of the poor demands a songthe muse can give no more fled are those times if eer such times were seen when rustic poets praised their native green no shepherds now in smooth alternate verse their countrys beauty or their nymphs rehearse yet still for these we frame the tender strain still in our lays fond corydons complain and shepherds boys their amorous pains reveal the only pains alas they never feel on mincios banks in caesars bounteous reign if tityrus found the golden age again must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong mechanic echoes of the mantuan song from truth and nature shall we widely stray where virgil not where fancy leads the way yes thus the muses sing of happy swains because the muses never knew their pains they boast their peasants pipes but peasants now resign their pipes and plod behind the plough and few amid the rural tribe have time to number syllables and play with rhyme save honest duck what son of verse could share the poets rapture and the peasants care or the great labours of the field degrade with the new peril of a poorer trade from one chief cause these idle praises spring that themes so easy few forbear to sing they ask no thought require no deep design but swell the song and liquefy the line the gentle lover takes the rural strain a nymph his mistress and himself a swain with no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer but all to look like her is painted fair i grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms for him that gazes or for him that farms but when amid such pleasing scenes i trace the poor laborious natives of the place and see the midday sun with fervid ray on their bare heads and dewy temples play while some with feebler heads and fainter hearts deplore their fortune yet sustain their parts then shall i dare these real ills to hide in tinsel trappings of poetic pride no cast by fortune on a frowning coast which can no groves nor happy valleys boast where other cares than those the muse relates and other shepherds dwell with other mates by such examples taught i paint the cot as truth will paint it and as bards will not nor you ye poor of lettered scorn complain to you the smoothest song is smooth in vain oercome by labour and bowed down by time feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme can poets soothe you when you pine for bread by winding myrtles round your ruined shed can their light tales your weighty griefs oerpower or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour lo where the heath with withering brake grown oer lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor from thence a length of burning sand appears where the thin harvest waves its withered ears rank weeds that every art and care defy reign oer the land and rob the blighted rye there thistles stretch their prickly arms afar and to the ragged infant threaten war there poppies nodding mock the hope of toil there the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil hardy and high above the slender sheaf the slimy mallow waves her silky leaf oer the young shoot the charlock throws a shade and the wild tare clings round the sickly blade with mingled tints the rocky coasts abound and a sad splendor vainly shines around so looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn betrayed by man then left for man to scorn whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose while her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose whose outward splendour is but follys dress exposing most when most it gilds distress here joyless roam a wild amphibious race with sullen woe displayed in every face who far from civil arts and social fly and scowl at strangers with suspicious eye here too the lawless merchant of the main draws from his plough th intoxicated swain want only claimed the labor of the day but vice now steals his nightly rest away where are the swains who daily labor done with rural games played down the setting sun who struck with matchless force the bounding ball or made the pondrous quoit obliquely fall while some huge ajax terrible and strong engaged some artful stripling of the throng and foiled beneath the young ulysses fell when peals of praise the merry mischief tell where now are thesebeneath yon cliff they stand to show the freighted pinnace where to land to load the ready steed with guilty haste to fly in terror oer the pathless waste or when detected in their straggling course to foil their foes by cunning or by force or yielding part when equal knaves contest to gain a lawless passport for the rest here wandring long amid these frowning fields i sought the simple life that nature yields rapine and wrong and fear usurped her place and a bold artful surly savage race who only skilled to take the finny tribe the yearly dinner or septennial bribe wait on the shore and as the waves run high on the tossed vessel bend their eager eye which to their coast directs its ventrous way theirs or the oceans miserable prey as on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand and wait for favoring winds to leave the land while still for flight the ready wing is spread so waited i the favouring hour and fled fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign and cried ah hapless they who still remain who still remain to hear the ocean roar whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore till some fierce tide with more imperious sway sweeps the low hut and all it holds away when the sad tenant weeps from door to door and begs a poor protection from the poor but these are scenes where natures niggard hand gave a spare portion to the famished land hers is the fault if here mankind complain of fruitless toil and labor spent in vain but yet in other scenes more fair in view where plenty smilesalas she smiles for few and those who taste not yet behold her store are as the slaves that dig the golden ore the wealth around them makes them doubly poor or will you deem them amply paid in health labors fair child that languishes with wealth go then and see them rising with the sun through a long course of daily toil to run like him to make the plenteous harvest grow and yet not shard the plenty they bestow see them beneath the dogstars raging heat when the knees tremble and the temples beat behold them leaning on their scythes look oer the labour past and toils to come explore see them alternate suns and showers engage and hoard up aches and anguish for their age through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue when their warm pores imbibe the evening dew then own that labour may as fatal be to these thy slaves as luxury to thee amid this tribe too oft a manly pride strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide there may you see the youth of slender frame contend with weakness weariness and shame yet urged along and proudly loth to yield he strives to join his fellows of the field till longcontending nature droops at last declining health rejects his poor repast his cheerless spouse the coming danger sees and mutual murmurs urge the slow disease yet grant them health tis not for us to tell though the head droops not that the heart is well or will you urge their homely plenteous fare healthy and plain and still the poor mans share oh trifle not with wants you cannot feel nor mock the misery of a stinted meal homely not wholesome plain not plenteous such as you who envy would disdain to touch ye gentle souls who dream of rural ease whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please go if the peaceful cot your praises share go look within and ask if peace be there if peace be histhat drooping weary sire or theirs that offspring round their feeble fire or hers that matron pale whose trembling hand turns on the wretched hearth th expiring brand nor yet can time itself obtain for these lifes latest comforts due respect and ease for yonder see that hoary swain whose age can with no cares except his own engage who propped on that rude staff looks up to see the bare arms broken from the withering tree on which a boy he climbed the loftiest bough then his first joy but his sad emblem now he once was chief in all the rustic trade his steady hand the straightest furrow made full many a prize he won and still is proud to find the triumphs of his youth allowed a transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes he hears and smiles then thinks again and sighs for now he journeys to his grave in pain the rich disdain him nay the poor disdain alternate masters now their slave command and urge the efforts of his feeble hand who when his age attempts its task in vain with ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain oft may you see him when he tends the sheep his wintercharge beneath the hillock weep oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow oer his white locks and bury them in snow when roused by rage and muttering in the morn he mends the broken hedge with icy thorn why do i live when i desire to be at once from life and lifes long labour free like leaves in spring the young are blown away without the sorrows of a slow decay i like yon withered leaf remain behind nipped by the frost and shivering in the wind there it abides till younger buds come on as i now all my fellowswains are gone then from the rising generation thrust it falls like me unnoticed to the dust these fruitful fields these numerous flocks i see are others gain but killing cares to me to me the children of my youth are lords slow in their gifts but hasty in their words wants of their own demand their care and who feels his own want and succors others too a lonely wretched man in pain i go none need my help and none relieve my woe then let my bones beneath the turf be laid and men forget the wretch they would not aid thus groan the old till by disease oppressed they taste a final woe and then they rest theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door there where the putrid vapours flagging play and the dull wheel hums doleful through the day there children dwell who know no parents care parents who know no childrens love dwell there heartbroken matrons on their joyless bed forsaken wives and mothers never wed dejected widows with unheeded tears and crippled age with more than childhoodfears the lame the blind and far the happiest they the moping idiot and the madman gay here too the sick their final doom receive here brought amid the scenes of grief to grieve where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow mixed with the clamors of the crowd below here sorrowing they each kindred sorrow scan and the cold charities of man to man whose laws indeed for ruined age provide and strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride but still that scrap is bought with many a sigh and pride embitters what it cant deny say ye oppressed by some fantastic woes some jarring nerve that baffles your repose who press the downy couch while slaves advance with timid eye to read the distant glance who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease to name the nameless evernew disease who with mock patience dire complaints endure which real pain and that alone can cure how would ye bear in real pain to lie despised neglected left alone to die how would ye bear to draw your latest breath where all thats wretched paves the way for death such is that room which one rude beam divides and naked rafters form the sloping sides where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen and lath and mud is all that lie between save one dull pane that coarsely patched gives way to the rude tempest yet excludes the day here on a matted flock with dust oerspread the drooping wretch reclines his languid head for him no hand the cordial cup applies nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes no friends with soft discourse his pain beguile nor promise hope till sickness wears a smile but soon a loud and hasty summons calls shakes the thin roof and echoes round the walls anon a figure enters quaintly neat all pride and business bustle and conceit with looks unaltered by these scenes of woe with speed that entering speaks his haste to go he bids the gazing throng around him fly and carries fate and physic in his eye a potent quack long versed in human ills who first insults the victim whom he kills whose murdrous hand a drowsy bench protect and whose most tender mercy is neglect paid by the parish for attendance here he wears contempt upon his sapient sneer in haste he seeks the bed where misery lies impatience marked in his averted eyes and some habitual queries hurried oer without reply he rushes on the door his drooping patient long inured to pain and long unheeded knows remonstrance vain he ceases now the feeble help to crave of man and mutely hastens to the grave but ere his death some pious doubts arise some simple fears which bold bad men despise fain would he ask the parish priest to prove his title certain to the joys above for this he sends the murmuring nurse who calls the holy stranger to these dismal walls and doth not he the pious man appear he passing rich with forty pounds a year ah no a shepherd of a different stock and far unlike him feeds this little flock a jovial youth who thinks his sundays task as much as god or man can fairly ask the rest he gives to loves and labors light to fields the morning and to feasts the night none better skilled the noisy pack to guide to urge their chase to cheer them or to chide sure in his shot his game he seldom missed and seldom failed to win his game at whist then while such honors bloom around his head shall he sit sadly by the sick mans bed to raise the hope he feels not or with zeal to combat fears that evn the pious feel now once again the gloomy scene explore less gloomy now the bitter hour is oer the man of many sorrows sighs no more up yonder hill behold how sadly slow the bier moves winding from the vale below there lie the happy dead from trouble free and the glad parish pays the frugal fee no more oh death thy victim starts to hear churchwarden stern or kingly overseer no more the farmer gets his humble bow thou art his lord the best of tyrants thou now to the church behold the mourners come sedately torpid and devoutly dumb the village children now their games suspend to see the bier that bears their ancient friend for he was one in all their idle sport and like a monarch ruled their little court the pliant bow he formed the flying ball the bat the wicket were his labours all him now they follow to his grave and stand silent and sad and gazing hand in hand while bending low their eager eyes explore the mingled relics of the parish poor the bell tolls late the moping owl flies round fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound the busy priest detained by weightier care defers his duty till the day of prayer and waiting long the crowd retire distressed to think a poor mans bones should lie unblessed

 down in a green and shady bed a modest violet grew its stalk was bent it hung its head as if to hide from view  and yet it was a lovely flower its colours bright and fair it might have graced a rosy bower instead of hiding there  yet there it was content to bloom in modest tints arrayed and there diffused its sweet perfume within the silent shade  then let me to the valley go this pretty flower to see that i may also learn to grow in sweet humility

 carpaccio san giorgio degli schiavoni venice you are amazed to find trees in venice  to turn a corner into a campo where two or three rustling acacias spread their halo of leaves over two or three redslatted benches it’s as if you had slipped through a curtained doorway into a hall full of dull gold scenes by carpaccio  a miraculous light  though the rio’s still shrouded in a mist compounded of water vapour and smog so it’s not that the sun has come out it’s something to do with the leaves and painting  in the realm of echoes where footsteps reverberate endlessly between two walls and dawn is the chink of a stonemason at his reparations disembodied voices irresistible as bird calls yes you’re amazed to find trees in venice shedding their gold leaf onto the pavement outside a secondhand bookstore it’s like carpaccio’s little white dog wagging his tail at the feet of saint augustine who is staring out of the window looking for the voice of saint jerome

 twas the night before christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads and mamma in her kerchief and i in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winters nap when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter away to the window i flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash the moon on the breast of the newfallen snow gave a lustre of midday to objects below when what to my wondering eyes did appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick i knew in a moment he must be st nick more rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name nowdasher nowdancer now prancer and vixen oncomet oncupid ondonner and blitzen to the top of the porch to the top of the wall now dash away dash away dash away all as leaves that before the wild hurricane fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky so up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof as i drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a pedler just opening his pack his eyeshow they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight “happy christmas to all and to all a good night”

 when i met vivaldi it was dark a ragman lashed his horse’s bells streets tilted into slow wind tunnels  no it was another night in winter snow as soft as opium two winoes wassailed down an alley through a milk truck’s ruts  in the subways a violin was whistling down chrome tracks past cobalt semaphores rats and pennies underneath the 3rd rail     has it never been so quiet that you’ve heard the manhole covers rumble when the el goes overhead icicles growing could you tell the difference between the sound of filaments in light bulbs burning down and a dulcimer played in a padded cell  a meager music hovers everywhere at mouths of drains echoing stairwells where girls in muslin disappear whispering “allegro”  when i closed my eyes less than a ghost vivaldi cupped a mouth harp like a match against the wind

 you yearn so much you could be a yacht your mind has already set sail it takes a few days to arrive  at island pace but soon you are barefoot on the sand the slim waves testing your feet  like health professionals you toe shells sea glass and odd things that have drifted for years and finally washed up here  you drop your towel and step out of your togs ungainly first your right foot then  the other stepping down the sand to stand in the water  there is no discernible difference in temperature you breaststroke in the lazy blue  a guy passing in a rowboat says “beautiful isn’t it” and it is your body afloat in salt as if cured

 inside the veins there are navies setting forth tiny explosions at the waterlines and seagulls weaving in the wind of the salty blood  it is the morning the country has slept the whole winter window seats were covered with fur skins the yard was full of stiff dogs and hands that clumsily held heavy books  now we wake and rise from bed and eat breakfast shouts rise from the harbor of the blood mist and masts rising the knock of wooden tackle in the sunlight  now we sing and do tiny dances on the kitchen floor our whole body is like a harbor at dawn we know that our master has left us for the day

 sets the folds in alignment this a shallow a constitution of drops that moves to displace itself and unconsciously reverts to image  in such a state the wave has become a setting a table across which cups with propositions rolled inside them are passed  the passage of cups does not limit the range of potential outcomes and yet at no point does the wave dissolve into abstraction  the shades are drawn and we are overwhelmed by flags crossing the black divan  an axis of rotation gliding a fraction of an inch and yet unveiling its total mass  advancing the disc of its body shimmers alighting on the sand it reveals itself in a cluster of pulses  dilated it lifts from the sea floor fine spokes radiating on a wheel it passes between bands of bright water a kiss or a plow

 1  in prologue let me plainly say i shall not ever come to that discretion where i do not rage to think i grow decrepit burstenbellied bald and toothless thick of hearing tremulous of leg dry and roughbarked as a hemlock slab the soft rot setting in and all my wheezy dreams the tunnelling of beetles in a raspy bark for now i am fleshed at smaller sports and grow in time into the mineral thick fell of earth vermont hairy with violets roses lilies and like minions and darlings of the spring meantime working wonders rousing astonishments and being a humble man i at the same time acknowledge my miscreate the nightshades cabbages and fleaworts of my plot though always i try to turn my back and scorn upon the inkhorn term and speak as is most commonly received with smile and wink and approbative nod not overfine nor at the same time reckless of the phrase nor ever ugly turdy tutmouthed but always joyous at the goosey brain the woolpack of the solid cloud a crowd a heap a troop a plume of trees grass gulls and rabbits in the end no doubt a vulgar prattle but the planet swells and bulges and protrudes beyond my eyes’ aversions and tottery fuddled always i give up i am not understood or wrongly out of some general assumption of my innocence   2  this much i wish to say my nonesuch nosegay native sweet in someway plainer this is my letter to you and out of most severe purpose the bee the honey stalk the whole keep of the house endanger me the perspectives of the clapboard the steep falls of the lawn the razory apices of ridges and the abdominous curves of the meadow into the far trees there are ponds below the house and water runs the road crosses the water and the road diminishes to the reach of the next farm and the farm beyond that and two miles bearing right or left somewhere runs highway 25 i have found my way with difficulty i am confused halfway i have suffered a failure of vital powers a swoon have been smirked at by the natives and misdirected fitting for i always dream of the painless redemption the return from fiasco and tumultuous journey to the transcendentally serene lawns of a transcendentally white house with columns of oak trees and iron deer and the affectionate greeting of one who has these many years waited in full patience without complaint for me to come in bleeding dusty and deliquescent from the fields the blade in my thigh or blinded the victim of fire or ravenous birds the lovely blood on my cheek like tears onelimbed a bullet in my heart my hands my head cut off and the dark pulses of my blood diminishing yet never a reproach for my criminal selfnegligence my careless japeries and clumsy flounderings instead my brow is wiped my wounds attended to blood let leeches applied i heal i grow strong i can set forth again renewed valiant sturdy full of high spirits lively gay spruce in looks a reveler a merry prankster dimpled in the cheek from smiling perfect pilgrim fit for the chemistry of the resurrection yet  i am of wild and changeful moods i am perhaps worthy of being stoned sometimes i lie hid and lurk in wait for the giggling girleries and leap out and shout and scatter them like chickens from the boot to the safe and flying four winds i am easy and fluent in the telling of lies and let it be said that i roar and sing scurrilous songs in base places and shall no doubt for this little vain merriment find a sorrowful reckoning in the end still my noises please me and what this wretched poet overmuch desires he easily believes it is his conventional cowardice it makes him immortally glad but then he always grows morose that is in his favor he repents lances his soul thinks of the willows and the columned porch and the wind melliloquent about the chimneys and you from where he sits now at the far end of this small porch of a federal farmhouse in this very and summery vermont   3  i look down the pitches of the lawn fireflies make small explosions among the grass stems and i think that to walk down that slant of lawn to the black waters of the brook at the dark join of the cleft would be like dying and that if i die i will never pardon time i think my words will echo only in my own mind forever to what purpose i do not know i see a firefly trapped inside the screen i have no name for any of this i know it clearly in the same way i know the dead cry of the starlings in the eaves the smell of after rain the warm air holding in the hollows of the roads for this there is no name the holding mind is likewise without name that is the final thought it is the disorder the reason for all this the clouds begin to reach up blood mountain and i am sitting on a farmhouse porch and there are trees and it is late and i am dreaming that i dream i stare down into a fouled well and see the white legbones of a deer and the water’s surface matte with loose hair the green stink welling and bellying from the fertile sump up and flowing outwards in a fountaining current of vines and melons and leaves and the knotgrass lawns blossoming with gilliflowers shoulderhigh cloudhigh the sun finally smothering in grass and then in the entire silence of this growth the grasses thickening darkening becoming clouds reaching up from the ridges and all night  there is rain i dream that when i awaken it is a shining milky day four roosters are crowing in the yard and geese dabble in the green soft muds of the ditches this is the literal surface and for all the extravagance of what has gone before i now repent and make an image all of vermont each night blazes with fireflies the comet is a faint green phosphorescence to the north the catalpas blossom and each noon the sunlight hardens and the sky is a clear ground and i can look from my open doorway into dry and fiery yards you see i draw back always i cannot be understoodo i wud slepe all the swete darkemans nor ever speke

 about the age of twenty when the first hairfall signals that nature is finished with the organism and we just begin to conceive the use of women having been all this time more enamored of the fountain than the cistern we retire to nursing homes whether they be kaleidoscopic gardens aimed like a blunderbuss of hermeticism at our neighbors or a desperate dream safari through old zambesi where the suicidal waves of angry natives give the illusion that we are advancing rapidly or the crow’snest of this windless office block where the cook is already boiling the last sail  and sitting on the bench like a snowfall of beard expectorated by a cloudy hat we consider the byproducts of life such as to name only the least offensive to the nose the body itself when it has finally reached that eminence from which all is visible and from which it nonetheless feels the need to move on to a homestead of its dreams like an abandoned chicken coop on the sandy streamside under the tulip poplars and to words which result from an instinct for what is impossible to soften the blow for others including ourselves

 the field is filled with what we see without sleep never completely closed it quickly erodes when tilled before rain  if clogged with boulders it won’t be razed and once burdened cannot quicken under flocks  the field reveals glint and holds leaning pulls twist from taut knots of buds  we watch the field for stirring wait for stems to spring back from sparrows  we hope for a swell in its middle so we can say we saw the sway that comes from noticing  water meanders to prairie potholes throws cordgrass into switchbacks as we push past bramble and scare a whistling wheel of geese into air  the field draws hawks and sides of trains cradles pools from storms where ducks plumb for water snails  we trample light between us no way to lope in parting the swales we must flatten to fill the space with all the rolling wrapped up in us  before home the gabled barn across the road throws the brightest rise we’ve ever seen the field try on  the field is not in rows is not a faded sawsonged croon it pushes green a mist above mud shows how we make do  we wonder what we’re not in the field what scours cuts or knocks if we could stay and still feel full the low line rounding out a spread of subtle slope

 when i am asked how i began writing poems i talk about the indifference of nature  it was soon after my mother died a brilliant june day everything blooming  i sat on a gray stone bench in a lovingly planted garden but the day lilies were as deaf as the ears of drunken sleepers and the roses curved inward nothing was black or broken and not a leaf fell and the sun blared endless commercials for summer holidays  i sat on a gray stone bench ringed with the ingenue faces of pink and white impatiens and placed my grief in the mouth of language the only thing that would grieve with me

 from this height the sunset spans the whole world  before me houses and trees are shadows  neon flares between them like sudden fire  the freeways run always  strangely vacant with riderless cars  empty air   the windows up here  refract the blue slate and rose light  making the hills on the horizon collide  with ideas of sussex piedmont  or the cold clear wind of the abruzzi  but that is never what is out there   at home the lamp curls its aurora  into the corners of the room  and out the windows  squares rectangles of light  stake out a territory on the ragged lawn   in the center of things  between the pressing of the window and air   a small space   there is a meeting that defines  nothing everything

 the time has been that these wild solitudes yet beautiful as wild were trod by me oftener than now and when the ills of life had chafed my spiritwhen the unsteady pulse beat with strange flutteringsi would wander forth and seek the woods the sunshine on my path was to me a friend the swelling hills the quiet dells retiring far between with gentle invitation to explore their windings were a calm society that talked with me and soothed me then the chant of birds and chime of brooks and soft caress of the fresh sylvan air made me forget the thoughts that broke my peace and i began to gather simples by the fountain’s brink and lose myself in daydreams while i stood in nature’s loneliness i was with one with whom i early grew familiar one who never had a frown for me whose voice never rebuked me for the hours i stole from cares i loved not but of which the world deems highest to converse with her when shrieked the bleak november winds and smote the woods and the brown fields were herbless and the shades that met above the merry rivulet were spoiled i sought i loved them still they seemed like old companions in adversity still there was beauty in my walks the brook bordered with sparkling frostwork was as gay as with its fringe of summer flowers afar the village with its spires the path of streams and dim receding valleys hid before by interposing trees lay visible through the bare grove and my familiar haunts seemed new to me nor was i slow to come among them when the clouds from their still skirts had shaken down on earth the feathery snow and all was white the pure keen air abroad albeit it breathed no scent of herb nor heard lovecall of bird nor merry hum of bee was not the air of death bright mosses crept over the spotted trunks and the close buds that lay along the boughs instinct with life patient and waiting the soft breath of spring feared not the piercing spirit of the north the snowbird twittered on the beechen bough and ’neath the hemlock whose thick branches bent beneath its bright cold burden and kept dry a circle on the earth of withered leaves the partridge found a shelter through the snow the rabbit sprang away the lighter track of fox and the raccoon’s broad path were there crossing each other from his hollow tree the squirrel was abroad gathering the nuts just fallen that asked the winter cold and sway of winter blast to shake them from their hold  but winter has yet brighter sceneshe boasts splendors beyond what gorgeous summer knows or autumn with his many fruits and woods all flushed with many hues come when the rains have glazed the snow and clothed the trees with ice while the slant of sun of february pours into the bowers a flood of light approach the incrusted surface shall upbear thy steps and the broad arching portals of the grove welcome thy entering look the massy trunks are cased in pure crystal each light spray nodding and tinkling in the breath of heaven is studded with its trembling waterdrops that glimmer with an amethystine light but round the parentstem the long low boughs bend in a glittering ring and arbors hide the glassy floor oh you might deem the spot the spacious cavern of some virgin mine deep in the womb of earthwhere the gems grow and diamonds put forth radiant rods and bud with amethyst and topazand the place lit up most royally with the pure beam that dwells in them or haply the vast hall of fairy palace that outlasts the night and fades not in the glory of the sun where crystal columns send forth slender shafts and crossing arches and fantastic aisles wind from the sight in brightness and are lost among the crowded pillars raise thine eye thou seest no cavern roof no palace vault there the blue sky and the white drifting cloud look in again the wildered fancy dreams of spouting fountains frozen as they rose and fixed with all their branching jets in air and all their sluices sealed all all is light light without shade but all shall pass away with the next sun from numberless vast trunks loosened the crashing ice shall make a sound like the far roar of rivers and the eve shall close o’er the brown woods as it was wont  and it is pleasant when the noisy streams are just set free and milder suns melt off the plashy snow save only the firm drift in the deep glen or the close shade of pines ’tis pleasant to behold the wreaths of smoke roll up among the maples of the hill where the shrill sound of youthful voices wakes the shriller echo as the clear pure lymph that from the wounded trees in twinkling drops falls mid the golden brightness of the morn is gathered in with brimming pails and oft wielded by sturdy hands the stroke of axe makes the woods ring along the quiet air come and float calmly off the soft light clouds such as you see in summer and the winds scarce stir the branches lodged in sunny cleft where the cold breezes come not blooms alone the little windflower whose just opened eye is blue as the spring heaven it gazes at startling the loiterer in the naked groves with unexpected beauty for the time of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar and ere it comes the encountering winds shall oft muster their wrath again and rapid clouds shade heaven and bounding on the frozen earth shall fall their volleyed stores rounded like hail and white like snow and the loud north again shall buffet the vexed forest in his rage

 out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day i paused and said i will turn back from here no i will go on fartherand we shall see the hard snow held me save where now and then one foot went through the view was all in lines straight up and down of tall slim trees too much alike to mark or name a place by so as to say for certain i was here or somewhere else i was just far from home a small bird flew before me he was careful to put a tree between us when he lighted and say no word to tell me who he was who was so foolish as to think what he thought he thought that i was after him for a feather the white one in his tail like one who takes everything said as personal to himself one flight out sideways would have undeceived him and then there was a pile of wood for which i forgot him and let his little fear carry him off the way i might have gone without so much as wishing him goodnight he went behind it to make his last stand it was a cord of maple cut and split and piledand measured four by four by eight and not another like it could i see no runner tracks in this years snow looped near it and it was older sure than this years cutting or even last years or the years before the wood was gray and the bark warping off it and the pile somewhat sunken clematis had wound strings round and round it like a bundle what held it though on one side was a tree still growing and on one a stake and prop these latter about to fall i thought that only someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks could so forget his handiwork on which he spent himself the labor of his ax and leave it there far from a useful fireplace to warm the frozen swamp as best it could with the slow smokeless burning of decay

 arent you glad at least that the earthworms under the grass are ignorant as they eat the earth of the good they confer on us that their silence isnt a silent reproof for our bad manners our never casting earthward a crumb of thanks for their keeping the soil from packing so tight that no root however determined could pierce it  imagine if they suspected how much we owe them how the weight of our debt would crush us even if they enjoyed keeping the grass alive the garden flowers and vegetables the clover and wanted nothing that we could give them not even the merest nod of acknowledgment a debt to angels would be easy in comparison bright weightless creatures of cloud who serve an even brighter and lighter master  lucky for us they dont know what theyre doing these puny anonymous creatures of dark and damp who eat simply to live with no more sense of mission than nature feels in providing for our survival better save our gratitude for a friend who gives us more than we can give in return and never hints shes waiting for reciprocity  if i had nickel id give it to you the lover says who having nothing available in the solid indicative world scrapes up a coin or two in the world of the subjunctive a nickel with a hole drilled in the top so you can fasten it to your bracelet a charm to protect you against your enemies  for his sake shed wear it not for her own so he might believe shes safe as she saunters home across the field at night the moon above her below her the loam compressed by the soles of her loafers and the tunneling earthworms tireless silent as they persist oblivious in their service

 lost at sea april 10 1963 i stand on the ledge where rock runs into the river as the night turns brackish with morning and mourn the drowned here the sea is diluted with river i watch it slaver like a dog curing of rabies its ravening over lickspittle ocean nuzzles the dry ground but the dream that woke me was worse than the sea’s gray slipslap there are no such sounds by day  this crushing of people is something we live with daily by unaccountable whim or caught up in some harebrained scheme of death tangled in cars dropped from the sky in flame men and women break the pledge of breath and now under water gone all jetsam and small in the pressure of oceans collected a squad of brave men in a hull  why can’t our dreams be content with the terrible facts the only animal cursed with responsible sleep we trace disaster always to our own acts i met a monstrous self trapped in the black deep all these years he smiled i’ve drilled at sea  for this crush of water then he saved only me  we invest ships with life look at a harbor at first light with better grace than men in their movements the vessels run to their labors working the fields that the tide has made green again their beauty is womanly they are named for ladies and queens although by a wise superstition these are called after fish the finned boats silent and submarine the crushing of any ship has always been held in dread like a house burned or a great tree felled  i think of how sailors laugh as if cold and wet and dark and lost were their private funny derision and i can judge then what dark compression astonishes them now their sunken faces set unsmiling where the currents sluice to and fro and without humor somewhere northeast of here and below   seabrothers i lower to you the ingenuity of dreams strange lungs and bells to escape in let me stay aboard last

 the sky has been dark for many years my skin has become as damp and pale as rice paper and feels the way mother’s used to before the drying sun parched it out there in the fields  lately when i touch my eyelids my hands react as if i had just touched something hot enough to burn my skin aspirin colored tingles with migraine mother has been massaging the left side of my face especially in the evenings when the pain flares up  this morning her breathing was graveled her voice gruff with affection when i wheeled her into the bath she was in a good humor making jokes about her great breasts floating in the milky water like two walruses flaccid and whiskered around the nipples i scrubbed them with a sour taste in my mouth thinking six children and an old man have sucked from these brown nipples  i was almost tender when i came to the blue bruises that freckle her body places where she has been injecting insulin for thirty years i soaped her slowly she sighed deeply her eyes closed it seems it has always been like this the two of us in this sunless room the splashing of the bathwater  in the afternoons when she has rested she prepares our ritual of tea and rice garnished with a shred of gingered fish a slice of pickled turnip a token for my white body we eat in the familiar silence she knows i am not to be trusted even now planning my escape as i toast to her health with the tea she has poured a thousand cranes curtain the window fly up in a sudden breeze
