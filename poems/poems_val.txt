 i’m all alone in this world, she said, ain’t got nobody to share my bed, ain’t got nobody to hold my hand— the truth of the matter’s i ain’t got no man.  big boy opened his mouth and said, trouble with you is you ain’t got no head! if you had a head and used your mind you could have me with you all the time.  she answered, babe, what must i do?  he said, share your bed— and your money, too.

 they wore out the a in the letterpress case only after a few thousand hits under the inked rollers, pulling the crank, turning the giant wheel.  must have been 1820. thereabouts. wanderer, glory-run of letters:thereabouts.  hunger took its due from the belly of the a. so? all kept reading it  as a— those who could read — and anyway, a bite out of that apple proves our kind mortal. rare good paper into page until most everything about the a was shot. practically prayer, humility, a great foreboding not just bare-bones frugal.  simple aaaa from that a— first letter loved, to hear it ache and fill even at half breath.  look, it’s standard. no one but a divine being or two makes perfect copy.  real case in point: my now and again body so poorly echoed off my mother, my father out of a broken skull simmering in a bog, bc probably, long before ad pretended anything in order. earlier, our whole dark hole of a planet copied unto itself via earthquake, flood, star shard, raging molten ball in the middle, some big bang’s idea of a flawed, proper start.  for a while there, the tiny a wounded. what it does. doing, to herald every human sentence.

 he was a big man, says the size of his shoes on a pile of broken dishes by the house; a tall man too, says the length of the bed in an upstairs room; and a good, god-fearing man, says the bible with a broken back on the floor below the window, dusty with sun; but not a man for farming, say the fields cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.  a woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves covered with oilcloth, and they had a child, says the sandbox made from a tractor tire. money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole. and the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames. it was lonely here, says the narrow country road.  something went wrong, says the empty house in the weed-choked yard. stones in the fields say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste. and the child? its toys are strewn in the yard like branches after a storm—a rubber cow, a rusty tractor with a broken plow, a doll in overalls. something went wrong, they say.

 the poet:  fugitive lung, prodigal intestine— where’s the pink crimp in my side where they took you out?   the octopus:  it must be a dull world, indeed, where everything appears to be a version or extrapolation of you.  the birds are you. the springtime is you. snails, hurricanes, saddles, elevators— everything becomes you.  i, with a shift of my skin, divest my self to become the rock that shadows it.  think of when your reading eyes momentarily drift, and in that instant  you see the maddening swarm of alien ciphers submerged within the text gone before you can focus. that’s me.  or your dozing revelation on the subway that you are slowly being digested. me again.  i am the fever dream in which you see your loved ones as executioners. i am also their axe.  friend, while you’re exhausting the end of a day with your sad approximations,  i’m a mile deep in the earth, vamping my most flawless impression of the abyss to the wild applause of eels.

 no, this is not my life, thank god ... ... worn out like this, and crippled by brain-fag; obsessed first by one person, and then (almost at once) most horribly besotted by another; these februaries, full of draughts and cracks, they belong to the people in the streets, the others out there – haberdashers, writers of menus.  salt breezes! bolsters from istanbul! barometers, full of contempt, controlling moody isobars. sumptuous tittle-tattle from a summer crowd that’s fed on lemonades and matinées. and seas that float themselves about from place to place, and then spend

 1   out the barred window sandbags in a sagging wall surround the guard post where a soldier half-hidden by the flag holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost.  it’s sunday and quiet, the traffic noise off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps pulled tight over the troop trucks. somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys,  telling some joke in arabic in which i’m pretty sure i hear the word “zubrak”: i walk between shelves loaded with canned rations,  the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room while a pinned-up psyops leaflet declares, if you sleep in a cemetery,you’re bound to have nightmares.   2   no one sees the doll’s decapitated head small and neat in rubble. never tired or sleepy, the head is its own country obstinately surviving, the pupil  of   its one eye peering through the glass’s pure transparency. and a few feet away lie its slim, plastic, long-legged thighs almost like an obscenity the eye watches over —  no one in the street, nothing but bolt-marks from tank-treads scarring the concrete to give any of   it drama — and what  about the way the lips’ frozen smirk keeps daring me to touch the sexless v between the thighs staring up at me?   3   the barracks dissolve into a reef   of   rubble in the fog. on either side of the road, crater after crater flashes with glints of glass, plastic bags, a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair.  the tv station, the power stacks thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded posters and banners strung across the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:  all that’s left in the emptied town after the army pulled out are psyops leaflets fluttering up around the car that winds  down the coast road deeper into mist, headlights probing like instruments in a wound they illuminate the more they violate.

 the mower alone saw from the median the cloud come over the mountain down to trawl the valley like a whale and the swifts like water passing through her white baleen.  the mower alone patrolling the haw with the hawks saw from the median the cloud come over the mountain to swallow where the sky had been and where the town had been pinned by steeples and hummed electric hubris.  for everyone else on either side of the narrow the cloud was only a minute of a single verse because the highway treats the blues as all the same as if bentonia were sunflower county but the land between the lanes even while under the blades sees the power in every cloud and hears each song spiral out of an old familiar tune just so to devour our hearts.

NEW POEM
 when you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city, mad-eyed from stating the obvious, not proclaiming our fall but begging us in god’s name to have self-pity,  spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range, the long numbers that rocket the mind; our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind, unable to fear what is too strange.  nor shall you scare us with talk of the death of the race. how should we dream of this place without us?— the sun mere fire, the leaves untroubled about us, a stone look on the stone’s face?  speak of the world’s own change. though we cannot conceive of an undreamt thing, we know to our cost how the dreamt cloud crumbles, the vines are blackened by frost, how the view alters. we could believe,  if you told us so, that the white-tailed deer will slip into perfect shade, grown perfectly shy, the lark avoid the reaches of our eye, the jack-pine lose its knuckled grip  on the cold ledge, and every torrent burn as xanthus once, its gliding trout stunned in a twinkling. what should we be without the dolphin’s arc, the dove’s return,  these things in which we have seen ourselves and spoken? ask us, prophet, how we shall call our natures forth when that live tongue is all dispelled, that glass obscured or broken  in which we have said the rose of our love and the clean horse of our courage, in which beheld the singing locust of the soul unshelled, and all we mean or wish to mean.  ask us, ask us whether with the worldless rose our hearts shall fail us; come demanding whether there shall be lofty or long standing when the bronze annals of the oak-tree close.

 somewhere zeno was smiling, the foul goblins of paradox were wearing their fairest clothes that night. my dinner with a chainsaw, the evening could have been called; and when one too many led to wise judgements too few, “i’m trying to break up with you!” he shouted as stockings and scruples flew; and what was over wasn’t; the brutal doings were sweeter than a caress; the thrill of it happening and the horror of it being an awful mistake collided like sweaty bodies in the dark, disheveled room. so this is moving on, she reflected after he left. but what was motion? no straight bright line but a wind every bit as stormy as the people it carried away from safety, through towns that froze and burned, helping them forward but not letting them forget for a second their ceaseless looking for what is lost, their sad resemblance to the quick and stubborn arrows that never arrive.  
NEW POEM
 after experience taught me that all the ordinary surroundings of social life are futile and vain;  i’m going to show you something very ugly: someday, it might save your life.  seeing that none of the things i feared contain in themselves anything either good or bad  what if you get caught without a knife; nothing—even a loop of piano wire;  excepting only in the effect they had upon my mind, i resolved to inquire  take the first two fingers of this hand; fork them out—kind of a “v for victory”—  whether there might be something whose discovery would grant me supreme, unending happiness.  and jam them into the eyes of your enemy. you have to do this hard. very hard. then press  no virtue can be thought to have priority over this endeavor to preserve one’s being.  both fingers down around the cheekbone and setting your foot high into the chest  no man can desire to act rightly, to be blessed, to live rightly, without simultaneously  you must call up every strength you own and you can rip off the whole facial mask.  wishing to be, to act, to live. he must ask first, in other words, to actually exist.   and you, whiner, who wastes your time dawdling over the remorseless earth, what evil, what unspeakable crime have you made your life worth?

 when one thing is becoming another, when writing is morphing, when the writing of an hour becomes the desire to write at all hours and into the night, fueled on caffeine or wine and desiring instruments of writing; typewriters, even a nib and ink well, and considering all the ways of stretching a space, digital or hard copy; hard copy, an ugly expression for printed matter, and for that matter, printed matter is efficient but lacks beauty. page, a soft and elongated word; page, an extension at the end of my fingers; page, a screen that holds dreams and desires; the page of legal document that bind. the page is a promise. i read all sides, turning the page counterclockwise and turning the page over for what i may have missed. desire is a stick for scratching words into the dirt and for chiseling stone until the words become solid. the pen is a body, an anatomy, not an earthworm with indecipherable ends; the pen has a head and tail, and inky guts. and the brain of the pen belongs to the maker of marks. later hours/another hour/late hours/early hours/happy hour/visiting hours.  all the elements of the dying hour surround my laptop, in the dying blades of cut grass and in the dying battery. finches continue their making of a nest of twigs and grasses, but i know the nest is early paper, the raw ingredients and pulp. i know the world is a page turner, a paper globe, and i know that the birds are the great writers of the sky.

 i’ve lived within half a mile of it for twenty years. west by the black iron weather-hen half-strangled with clematis on the garage roof i can locate it. past a low ridge in the cliff face of a limestone dale there’s a cave in the bushes.  when the old tigers were long since gone, leaving their teeth, the valley people would climb there with the dead they thought most useful;  push them well in,  take them out again, walk them around: ‘they’re coming! they’re coming’  we malagasies love our second burials. we hire a band that comes in a van. again with liquefaction almost done we hold our cherished ones in our arms. from the grave-clothes they fall in gobbets as dog-food falls from the can. we wrap them in fresh dry linen. they bless our lives with their happiness.  walk them around the valley. drop here a finger for the god that is a rat or a raven, here a metatarsal to set under the hearth for luck.  and what was luck?  the afterlife back then was fairly long: nothing demented like for ever,  nothing military. the afterlife would come to the party.

 after the yoruba though the amaryllis sags and spills so do those my wishes serve, all along the town. and yes, the new moon, kinked there in night's patch, tugs me so—but i can't reach to right the slant. and though our cat pads past without a tail, some with slinking tails peer one-eyed at the dawn, some with eyes are clawless, some with sparking claws contain no voice with which to sing of foxes gassing in the lane. round-shouldered pals parade smart shirts, while my broad back supports a scrubby jumper, fawn or taupe. the balding english air their stubble while some headless hero sports a feathered hat. i know a man whose thoroughbred grazes in his porch for want of livery. there are scholars of kant who can't find kent on the map, and men of kent who cannot fathom kant. we who would polish off a feast have lain late in our beds, our bellies groaning, throats on fire. we who'd drain a vat of wine have drunk our own blood for its sting. each of us in tatters flaunts one treasured garment flapping in the wind.

NEW POEM
 the glories of our blood and state are shadows, not substantial things; there is no armor against fate; death lays his icy hand on kings. scepter and crown must tumble down and in the dust be equal made with the poor crooked scythe and spade.  some men with swords may reap the field and plant fresh laurels where they kill, but their strong nerves at last must yield; they tame but one another still. early or late they stoop to fate and must give up their murmuring breath, when they, pale captives, creep to death.  the garlands wither on your brow, then boast no more your mighty deeds; upon death’s purple altar now see where the victor-victim bleeds. your heads must come to the cold tomb; only the actions of the just smell sweet and blossom in their dust.

 o this political air so heavy with the bells and motors of a slow night, and no place to rest but rain to walk—how it rings the washington streets! the umbrella’d congressmen; the rapping tires of big black cars, the shoulders of lobbyists caught under canopies and in doorways, and it rains, it will not let up, and meanwhile lame futurists weep into spengler’s prophecy, will the world be over before the races blend color? all color must be one or let the world be done— there’ll be a chance, we’ll all be orange! i don’t want to be orange! nothing about god’s color to complain; and there is a beauty in yellow, the old lama in his robe the color of cathay; in black a strong &amp; vital beauty, thelonious monk in his robe of norman charcoal— and if western civilization comes to an end (though i doubt it, for the prophet has not executed his prophecy) surely the eastern child will sit by a window, and wonder the old statues, the ornamented doors; the decorated banquet of the west— inflamed by futurists i too weep in rain at night at the midnight of western civilization; dante’s step into hell will never be forgotten by hell; the gods’ adoption of homer will never be forgotten by the gods; the books of france are on god’s bookshelf; no civil war will take place on the fields of god; and i don’t doubt the egg of the east its glory— yet it rains and the motors go and continued when i slept by that wall in washington which separated the motors in the death-parlor where joe mccarthy lay, lean and stilled, ten blocks from the capitol— i could never understand uncle sam his red &amp; white striped pants his funny whiskers his starry hat: how surreal yankee doodle dandy, goof! american history has a way of making you feel george washington is still around, that is when i think of washington i do not think of death— of all presidents i have been under hoover is the most unreal and fdr is the most president-looking and truman the most jewish-looking and eisenhower the miscast of time into space— hoover is another america, mr. 1930 and what must he be thinking now? fdr was my youth, and how strange to still see his wife around. truman is still in presidential time. i saw eisenhower helicopter over athens and he looked at the acropolis like only zeus could. of the people is fortunate and select. for the people has never happened in america or elsewhere. by the people is the sadness of america. i am not politic. i am not patriotic. i am nationalistic! i boast well the beauty of america to all the people in europe. in me they do not see their vision of america. o whenever i pass an american embassy i don’t know what to feel! sometimes i want to rush in and scream: “i’m american!” but instead go a few paces down to the american bar get drunk and cry: “i’m no american!” the men of politics i love are but youth’s fantasy: the fine profile of washington on coins stamps &amp; tobacco wraps the handsomeness and death-in-the-snow of hamilton. the eyeglasses shoe-buckles kites &amp; keys of ben franklin. the sweet melancholy of lincoln. the way i see christ, as something romantic &amp; unreal, is the way i see them. an american is unique among peoples. he looks and acts like a boyman. he never looks cruel in uniform. he is rednecked portly rich and jolly. white-haired serious harvard, kind and wry. a convention man a family man a rotary man &amp; practical joker. he is moonfaced cunning well-meaning &amp; righteously mean. he is madison avenue, handsome, in-the-know, and superstitious. he is odd, happy, quicker than light, shameless, and heroic great yawn of youth! the young don’t seem interested in politics anymore. politics has lost its romance! the “bloody kitchen” has drowned! and all that is left are those granite façades of pentagon, justice, and department— politicians do not know youth! they depend on the old and the old depend on them and lo! this has given youth a chance to think of heaven in their independence. no need to give them liberty or freedom where they’re at— when stevenson in 1956 came to san francisco he campaigned in what he thought was an italian section! he spoke of italy and joe dimaggio and spaghetti, but all who were there, all for him, were young beatniks! and when his car drove off ginsberg &amp; i ran up to him and yelled: “when are you going to free the poets from their attics!” great yawn of youth! mad beautiful oldyoung america has no candidate the craziest wildest greatest country of them all! and not one candidate— nixon arrives ever so temporal, self-made, frontways sideways and backways, could he be america’s against? detour to vehicle? mast to wind? shore to sea? death to life? the last president?

 1    kinship: is embarrassing the wind, like dead black boys, falling down from the trees, then downstream– on their knees, blood like, like a rich nation.  2    metaphor: becomes humiliating, and clean, ticking like a ripe machine. do not bend, fold, or mutilate me– this is your future speaking.  3    the air smells so metaphysical we have accused it– of smog, and lost manhood, then all ritual.  4    whoever wrote: a view is a mountain speaking but left the introduction for the snow, and accused silence of its soul.  5    the whole nation: is a stanza of blackness, a huge white whale, faith in space (like the newspapers), and the quiet insistence we have peace, and it’s your world, brother.

 the gates of mercy slammed on the right foot. they would not permit return and bent a wing. there was no choice but to learn to boogaloo. those horrid days were not without their pleasure, learning to swear and wearing mock leather so tight eyes bulged, a stolen puff or two behind crack-broken backs and tickled palms in hallways dark, flirtations during choir practice as the body organized itself against the will (a mystic gone ballistic, not home but blood on the range) as one descended on this effed-up breeding hole of greeds—to suffer chronic seeings  was’t hunger or holiness spurred the sighting?

 i surrender my weapons: catapult tears, rain-cloud hat, lip zip, brittle coat, taut teeth in guarded rows. pluck this plate of armor from my ear, drop it in the amnesty bin, watch my sadness land among the dark shapes of memory.  unarmed, now see me saunter past ticking baggage, loaded questions, gangs of doubt; my love equips me. i swear, ever since your cheeky face span round i trust this whole bloody world.

 we called off the search, and the weary climbed down from the glacier with their dogs exhausted in the spring sun too tired to eat the ice in their paws.  we had called his name, mostly for show, a ritual that kept us moving: in the high bowls, their stunted pines predating the flood, in the steep ravines sliding loose with scree, loudly at first, then speaking it to each other then spelling it out on forms required by law.  it is a form of praying, he claimed, to walk out to the very edge of your life. every time the reply comes clear as a stone at our thin crowns. it misses almost every time, humming as it goes.

 consider the toucan’s festive gold breast. its multicolored pecker, oddly cutesy &amp; perhaps, a cartoon-comfort to the gym-roped westerners reclining on a beach in costa rica. it’s the same old song: good-natured smile, hard work, a hat’s off kind of attitude &amp; before you can say post-racial, you’re a resort toucan. the benefits are room &amp; board but the cost is blood. most times it’s the closest ones—birds of the same rainforest, same quadrant, same tree—who give up your whereabouts to the jaguar. quick as you got the gig, the boss is tossing you out on your ass all over some flipped umbrellas &amp; a tourist’s scarfed thumb. so now you’re roofless, alone, vulnerable &amp; the beast is licking his chops in your mirrored aviators. stifling too is the midwestern subdivision in its treatment of the black squirrel. science tells us black squirrels have driven out native grey squirrels in numerous areas, but no bullshit in my development, black squirrels are relegated to lots with a view of the highway. mornings they work shade for acorns between homes narrow as lincoln logs. history tells us black squirrels can’t afford robust landscaping but will pay their mortgage— chair the neighborhood watch if you like. slenderizing, their night of hair. they’re sun’s prey. they avoid overexposure, make tanning trend. black squirrels they fit in, get along. know no one. they see other black squirrels &amp; run.

 there might be the quibble of birds and the swag of a river and a distantly belled altar of animals, softly spoken; certainly cattail, sumac, and fern would rise from the marshes nearby, revealed in forms too perfect to envy trees— not trying for larger and larger keepsakes.  cryptic and subtle green, hedgerows hiding mysterious deer, the start of a rabbit, as if towers and clouds had suddenly shadowed an open field— these would be the events of the day, life having narrowed down to please natural hungers and thirsts, the grass thick at our feet, and, above our heads, the stars, their fireworks anemones.  what shall i say of the house? or you? only industrious ghosts would know how lazily cropping up the view would make the impossible possible; nothing but weekdays would blankly graze on time’s oblivious pastures, free at last of motive and thought, and we, becoming ourselves so naturally, would never say, looking up at the sky, another life is shining in the sky.

 i have a special ticket to another planet beyond this earth. a comfortable world, and beautiful: a world without much smoke, not too hot and not too cold. the creatures are gentler there, and the governments have no secrets. the police are nonexistent: there are no problems and no fights. and the schools don’t exhaust their students with too much work for history has yet to start and there’s no geography and no other languages. and even better: the war has left its “r ” behind and turned into love, so the weapons sleep beneath the dust, and the planes pass by without shelling the cities, and the boats look like smiles on the water. all things are peaceful and kind on the other planet beyond this earth. but still i hesitate to go alone.

 today in el paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. the world is in a delay. all the political consultants drinking whiskey keep their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. they jingle when she brings them drinks. outside the giant plate glass windows the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings. i feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. each of the various faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. i don’t want to talk on the phone to an angel. at night before i go to sleep i am already dreaming. of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings. i examine my feelings without feeling anything. i ride my blue bike on the edge of the desert. i am president of this glass of water.

 on the pan american highway, somewhere between the north and south continent, you come across a chain of volcanoes,  a coast with a thick growth of palm trees, crunching waves of the sea; an isthmus neruda called “slender earth like a whip.”  when the road bends, turns into a street, the walls splattered with “yanqui go home!!!” you see a boy fifteen years old,  barefoot, sniffing glue in a small plastic bag. an old woman in an apron will step out, say, “this is the right street.”  in the public square, there will be no friend from school to welcome you, no drive to sonsonate, city of coconuts,  no one to order cold pilseners, oyster cocktails, or convince the waitress into dancing a cumbia or two with you.  instead, at the local bar, you’ll raise a bottle next to strangers, stub your cigarette out on the floor.  you’ll watch a country ten years after the civil war: an old man sitting on the curb, head between knees,  open hand stretched out. everything will hurt, your hair, your toenails, even your shoes.  you’ll curse dusty streets, demented sun slowly burning the nape of your neck, stray dogs following you to the park.  by nightfall, you drag yourself back to the bars, looking for a lost country in a shot of tíc táck. against the wall, three men with their guitars.  when you lie on a hotel bed, too tired to sleep, when you feel torn, twisted like an old newspaper, blown  from city to city, you have reached the place. you have begun to speak like a man by the side of the road, barefoot.

 what do we do with the body, do we burn it, do we set it in dirt or in stone, do we wrap it in balm, honey, oil, and then gauze and tip it onto and trust it to a raft and to water?  what will happen to the memory of his body, if one of us doesn't hurry now and write it down fast? will it be salt or late light that it melts like? floss, rubber gloves, and a chewed cap  to a pen elsewhere —how are we to regard his effects, do we throw them or use them away, do we say they are relics and so treat them like relics? does his soiled linen count? if so,  would we be wrong then, to wash it? there are no instructions whether it should go to where are those with no linen, or whether by night we should memorially wear it ourselves, by day  reflect upon it folded, shelved, empty. here, on the floor behind his bed is a bent photo—why? were the two of them lovers? does it mean, where we found it, that he forgot it or lost it  or intended a safekeeping? should we attempt to make contact? what if this other man too is dead? or alive, but doesn't want to remember, is human? is it okay to be human, and fall away  from oblation and memory, if we forget, and can't sometimes help it and sometimes it is all that we want? how long, in dawns or new cocks, does that take? what if it is rest and nothing else that  we want? is it a findable thing, small? in what hole is it hidden? is it, maybe, a country? will a guide be required who will say to us how? do we fly? do we swim? what will i do now, with my hands?

 there is ghazal swimming inside of her, wanting to be born. on the matter of foretelling, of small miracles, cactus flowers in bloom on this city fire escape, where inside your tongue touches every inch of her skin, where you lay your hand on her belly and sleep. here, she fingers the ornate remains of ancient mosques. here, some mythic angel will rise from the dust of ancestors’ bones. this is where you shall worship, at the intersections of distilled deities and memory’s sharp edges. the country is quite a poetic place; water and rock contain verse and metaphor, even wild grasses reply in rhyme. you are not broken. she knows this having captured a moment of lucidity; summer lightning bugs, sun’s rays in a jelly jar.  this is not a love poem, but a cove to escape the flux, however momentary. she is still a child, confabulating the fantastic; please do not erode her wonder for the liquid that is your language. there is thunderstorm in her chest, wanting to burst through her skin. this is neither love poem nor plea. this is not river, nor stone.

 rain commenced, and wind did.  a crippled ship slid ashore.  our swimmer’s limbs went heavy.  the sand had been flattened.  the primary dune, the secondary dune, both leveled.  the maritime forest, extracted.  every yard of the shore was shocked with jellyfish.  the blue pillow of the man o’ war empty in the afterlight.  the threads of the jellyfish, spent.  disaster weirdly neatened the beach.  we cultivated the debris field.  castaway trash, our treasure.  jewel box, spoon ring, sack of rock candy.  a bicycle exoskeleton without wheels, grasshopper green.  our dead ten speed.  we rested in red mangrove and sheltered in sheets.  our bruises blushed backwards, our blisters did.  is it true is it true  god help us we tried to stay shattered but we just got better.  we grew adept, we caught the fish as they fled.  we skinned the fish, our knife clicked like an edict.  we were harmed, and then we healed.

 one of those appointments you postpone until anxiety propels you to the phone, then have to wait too long for, to take an inconvenient time . . . late in the day, an old man and i watch the minute hand  on the waiting room wall. i’ve papers to grade, but he wants someone to talk to, and his attendant’s rude, so he turns his whiskery face to me: “y’ know, i lived my whole life in waltham, worked 40 years  at the watch factory—oh, that city used to be so beautiful, now it’s a mess, those cubans and puerto ricans, they ruined it.” coiled in his wheelchair, he’s mad for company, probably scared he’s dying,  *  and so am i. i don’t remember watch city as beautiful the year i was eleven, when merle and i rode the grove street bus to moody street to shoplift haircurlers and pond’s vanishing cream, nickel items  at the waltham woolworth’s. it was an old factory town, wooden triple-deckers, water rats swimming in the oily river. merle and i didn’t risk a furtive life of crime in our well-kempt auburndale  where we thought we were well-known, and canoers paddled the same charles river past our homes. and i still wonder what could have vanished when we rubbed the mystery elixir on our silky cheeks?  *  his cheeks sucked in, this geezer could be my grandfather forty years ago, so i ignore his racist overture and agree waltham was beautiful, as the attendant takes his social security card,  and whistles: “boy, are you old!” then mutters something else in spanish. the number must be low. . . . “1936— that was the first year of social security!” the old guy brags. the kid forsakes  our ancient history, flexes his muscles. he’s probably been listening to insults for an hour in the elder van, he’s bored and angry—why should he be nice? yet hungry for a distracting  fact or story, i encourage the grandfather, i want to be treated well myself some day, when i’ll need it even more than i do now. . . . my little bids for attention, my birds, fragile fluttering words, desire to be visible and seen. . . .  “fdr was okay, wasn’t he?” i’m playing 90, it’s what i do to make us both less lonely, reminisce as if we’d shared the ’30s, as if i’d been there, come from sicily or limerick, a seamstress  earning her hard living one town over. i always sat this way with doc, years after he’d retired, his best treasure (besides my golden mother) a gold pocket watch, a handsome waltham watch—  *  a different time, when the things a person held or owned weren’t many but were permanent, a part of who you were. so his elegant watch confused me toward the idea my little dentist grandfather  had some connection to the company, as if he’d labored there, a master craftsman, had been rewarded by a grateful boss. his bit of luxury, the swirling monogram on the back (which opened with a click),  ir, for isaac rosenberg, timepiece connected by a chain to a safety pin at his frayed striped trouser pocket; another pin secured his shawmut bankbook, deposits he’d made decades before  *  that i’d inherit, $214, shawmut branch nearby the long-gone waldorf cafeteria where he idled weekday mornings with his cronies, also reminiscing, i suppose (although then i didn’t think  of it), the good old days before the motorcar, before their children moved away. dexterity and skill gone, too, from his arthritic hands. he relished those mornings! the black-and-white  tiled floor, the nearly empty tables, the perfection salad, welsh rarebit, the “bloomberry pie.” the counterman. they serve an elegant porridge there, he told me, gourmet of the ordinary,  state-of-maine-ah grandfather, my mainiac. the soon-to-be-widowed wives elsewhere, polishing mahogany veneer, or playing bridge, or shopping coolidge corner from butcher to baker in prescient  black dresses. old men and women so relieved to be rid of the burden of one another for a whole morning, of the tired bickering sentences of long american marriages, of pain  and disappointment. what memories they’d had of courtships long since passed on to grandchildren, and half-false anyway, like studio photographs, mythic stories they could live with; now forgotten,  the mistakes they’d been too fearful or devout to rectify. i miss that cafeteria, the whole idea of cafeterias, although doc never took me, just pointed to it on our sunday drive, repeating  paeans to gray porridge, something no description’s glow could make me want. waltham had them, too, free-fire zones a kid alone could enter with five cents for huge iced cookies, black-and-whites,  *  half chocolate, half vanilla, all crisco and white sugar, chewed in gluttonous companionable half-light, wonderful— but who’d know that now? who cares? merle and i did everything subversive  we could imagine—which wasn’t much. i’m sure i cruised sin city in my mind, decayed old town—nowhere—but to me forbidden fruit: the 5 &amp; 10, eyelash curlers, odd metal torture instruments  i smuggled home that pinched my lids and made my lashes angle wildly up, delinquent startled in the bathroom mirror; tangee lipsticks the size of my little finger, unflattering coral;  pink girdles i’d eye furtively, wondering that i’d have to wriggle into one someday, or wear the bony corset my grandmother assured me was my fate. oh, esoteric glamorous puzzle of the vanished vanishing cream . . .  *  later, not so much later, the first day of my driver’s license, i drove the family station wagon down moody street and banged the traffic policeman’s rubber perch. he jumped down before it bounced the street,  and yelled me over in a rage. or maybe, he was kindly, it’s only my criminal terror i remember, of punishment fine-tuned, my ruined life, my new rights vanishing. hardly a threat, i know now, the feckless cop.  i gripped the steering wheel so hard to stop the huge recalcitrant ford, doomed to lose my brand-new temporary license— how could i think, my budding power stripped, i’d ever get the chance to live or drive?

 (for e)  i stop my hand midair.  if i touch her there everything about me will be true. the new world discovered without pick or ax.  i will be what brenda jones was stoned for in 1969. i saw it as a girl but didn’t know i was taking in myself.  my hand remembers, treading the watery room, just behind the rose-veiled eyes of memory.  alone in the yard tucked beneath the hood of her car, lucky clover all about her feet, green tea-sweet necklace for her mud-pie crusty work boots.  she fends off their spit &amp; words with silent two-handed twists &amp; turns of her socket wrench. a hurl of sticks &amp; stones and only me to whisper for her, from sidewalk far,  break my bones. a grown woman in grease-pocket overalls inside her own sexy transmission despite the crowding of hurled red hots. beneath the hood of her candy-apple camaro:  souped, shiny, low to the ground.  the stars over the atlantic are dangling salt crystals. the room at the seashell inn is $20 a night; special winter off-season rate. no one else here but us and the night clerk, five floors below, alone with his cherished stack of spiderman. my lips are red snails in a primal search for every constellation hiding in the sky of your body. my hand waits for permission, for my life to agree to be changed, forever. can captain night clerk hear my fingers tambourining you there on the moon? won’t he soon climb the stairs and bam! on the hood of this car? you are a woman with film reels for eyes. years of long talking have brought us to the land of the body. our skin is one endless prayer bead of brown. if my hand ever lands, i will fly past dreaming australian aborigines. the old claw hammer and monkey wrench that flew at brenda jones will fly across the yard of ocean at me. a grease rag will be thrust into my painter’s pants against my will. i will never be able to wash or peel any of this away. before the night is over someone i do not know will want the keys to my ’55 silver thunderbird. he will chase me down the street. a gaggle of spooked hens will fly up in my grandmother’s yard, never to lay another egg, just as i am jump- ed, kneed, pulled finally to the high ground of sweet clover.

 my father built a great worry around me like a dock once i left it before i was finished and he remained with his great, empty worry. and my mother—like a tree on the shore between her arms outstretched for me.  and in '31 my hands were merry and small and in '41 they learned to use a rifle and when i loved my first love my thoughts were like a bunch of colored balloons and the girl's white hand clutched them all with a thin string—and then let them fly.  and in '51 the movement of my life was like the movement of many slaves rowing a ship, and the face of my father like the lantern at the end of a parting train, and my mother closed all the clouds in her brown closet. and i climbed up my street, and the twentieth century was the blood in my veins, blood that wanted to go out to many wars, through many openings. it pounds on my head from inside and moves in angry waves to my heart.  but now, in the spring of '52, i see more birds have returned than left last winter. and i return down the slope of the mountain to my room where the woman's body is heavy and full of time.  
NEW POEM
 i  it is not to be bought for a penny in the candy store, nor picked from the bushes in the park. it may be found, perhaps, in the ashes on the distant lots, among the rusting cans and jimpson weeds. if you wish to eat fish freely, cucumbers and melons, you should have stayed in egypt.  ii  i am alone— and glad to be alone; i do not like people who walk about so late; who walk slowly after midnight through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks. i do not like my own face in the little mirrors of the slot-machines before the closed stores.  iii  walking along the highway, i smell the yellow flowers of a shrub, watch the starlings on a lawn, perhaps— but why are all these speeding away in automobiles, where are they off to in such a hurry? they must be going to hear wise men and to look at beautiful women, and i am just a fool to be loitering here alone.  iv  i like the sound of the street— but i, apart and alone, beside an open window and behind a closed door.  v  winter is here indeed; the leaves have long been swept from the winding walks; trees and ground are brown— all is in order. only the lamps now flourish in the park. we walk about and talk; but the troubles of the unsuccessful middle-aged are so uninteresting!  vi  now it is cold: where the snow was melting the walk crackles with black ice beneath my careful steps; and the snow is old and pitted, here grey with ashes and there yellow with sand. the walks lie in the cold shadow of houses; pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow for cold, out of the wind; but here, where the sunshine pours through a narrow street upon a little tree, black and naked of every leaf, the sparrows are in the sun, thick upon the twigs. those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows, bronze statues now, with outstretched arm or sword brave only the weather.  i find myself talking aloud as i walk; that is bad. only don juan would believe i am in conversation with the snow-covered statues; only st. francis that i am talking to the sparrows in the naked bushes, to the pigeons in the snow.  vii  the ropes in the wind slapping the flag-pole (the flag has been hauled down); behind the bare tree-tops the lights of an aeroplane moving away slowly.  a star or two shining between factory chimneys; the street dark and still because the street-lamp has been broken and it is cold and late.  viii  bright upon the table for your birthday, the burning candles will dissolve in rays and lumps of wax. unlike a skull, they say politely, this is you!  ix  i am afraid because of the foolishness i have spoken. i must diet on silence; strengthen myself with quiet.  where is the wisdom with which i may be medicined? i will walk by myself and cure myself in the sunshine and the wind.  x  i do not believe that david killed goliath. it must have been— you will find the name in the list of david’s captains. but, whoever it was, he was no fool when he took off the helmet and put down the sword and the spear and the shield and said, the weapons you have given me are good, but they are not mine: i will fight in my own way with a couple of pebbles and a sling.  xi  “shall i go there?” “as you like— it will not matter; you are not at all important.” the words stuck to me like burrs. the path was hidden under the fallen leaves; and here and there the stream was choked. where it forced a way the ripples flashed a second. she spoke unkindly but it was the truth: i shared the sunshine like a leaf, a ripple;  thinking of this, sunned myself and, for the moment, was content.  xii  there is nobody in the street of those who crowded about david to watch me as i dance before the lord: alone in my unimportance to do as i like.  xiii  your angry words—each false name sinks into me, and is added to the heap beneath. i am still the same: they are no part of me, which i keep; but the way i go, and over which i flow.  xiv the bridge  in a cloud bones of steel.  xv god and messenger  this pavement barren as the mountain on which god spoke to moses— suddenly in the street shining against my legs the bumper of a motor car.  xvi  a beggar stretches out his hand to touch a fur collar, and strokes it unseen, stealing its warmth for his finger tips.  xvii  the elevator man, working long hours for little—whose work is dull and trivial— must also greet each passenger pleasantly: to be so heroic he wears a uniform.  xviii  this subway station with its electric lights, pillars of steel, arches of cement, and trains— quite an improvement on the caves of the cave-men; but, look! on this wall a primitive drawing.  xix subway  people moving, people standing still, crowds and more crowds; a thousand and ten thousand iron girders as pillars; escape! but how, shut up in the moving train? and upstairs, in the street, the sun is shining as it shines in june.  xx poet with whiskey bottle and sailor  there is anguish there, certainly, and a commotion in the next room; shouts of words and phrases that do not make sentences and sentences that do not make sense. i open the door: ah, the hallway is crowded— descendants of the three wise men, now male and female, come again to worship in a stable.  xxi  the white cat on the lawn, lying in the sun against the hedge, lovely to look at— but this stout gentleman, who needs a shave badly, leaning in an arbor hung with purple grapes, purple grapes all about him, is unpleasant. am i becoming misanthropic? an atheist? why, this might be the god bacchus!  xxii  the bearded rag-picker seated among heaps of rags in a basement sings: it was born that way; that is the way it was born— the way it came out of some body to stink: nothing will change it— neither pity nor kindness.

 why not write something for those who scratched out improbable livings here? someone has managed to sow this broken field with stones, it appears,  so someone’s scratching it still, although that japanese knotweed has edged the tilth. two wasps in the child attempt to catch sun on a rail of the bridge.  the old local doctor has passed at almost a full decade past ninety. he never seemed depressed. seventy now, if barely,  i consider the field again: someone will drag these rocks away but they’ll be back. the air smells like rain, which is fine, the summer’s been much too dry.  nothing is left of the barn but some rusty steel straps in some nasty red osier. the stone fence still looks sound, but even there the knotweed steps over.  hadn’t i pledged an elegy to the old ones who worked here? you couldn’t claim they thrived, exactly, but maybe they likewise scented good wind full of rain,  lifted eyes above this old orchard to the cloud-darkened hills and found their support somehow, somewhere. no matter, they kept going until they could go no more.  the trees’ puckered apples have gathered a flock of birds, and as they alight, they’re full of unseasonable chatter, as if to say that all will be right.  the old ones i promised a poem must have said it too.it’ll be all right. i never knew them. they’re gone. i say it out loud,it’ll be all right.   —caledonia county, vermont

 do you know what’s the unluckiest thing in the world, a differential grasshopper said to me. i paused, i put down the diesel grinder i’d been trying to fix, i turned off the stealth bomber, i faded away from the faded away pedals, i put up finely embroidered silk panels over the faces of the statues, i pulled the green vacillating amplifier into the hallway, i swiveled seven of the chains and loosened the bolts in the balcony, i went into the barn to unlace the cattle and overturn the empty buckets, i put the white flag on the mailbox, i cut the telephone wires, i fed the ducks better than i usually feed them, i adjusted the faucets so they’d drip a little, i waved at old mr. wiley with his smokeless pipe and his manpowered plough across the field, i moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge, i taped the key to the bulldozer to the roof of the canopy, i took the cup of auger bits away from the rabbit hutch, i put a padlock on the children’s playhouse, i picked up a stick by the sideyard gate, i broke it over my knee, i went to the well to fill a stone pitcher with cool water, i let the donkey &amp; the goats go. i took a ladder to the hayloft and took down a suitcase. i could see across the valley down to the river from up there.

 whose woods these are i think i know ... the landings had gone wrong; white silk, like shrouds, covered the woods. the trees had trapped the flimsy fabric in their web—everywhere the harnessed bodies hung—helpless, treading air like water. we thought to float down easily—a simple thing like coming home: feet first, a welcome from the waiting fields, a gentle fall in clover.  we hadn’t counted on this wilderness, the gusts of wind that took us over; we were surprised by the tenacity of branching wood, its reach, and how impenetrable the place we left, and thought we knew, could be. sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling pendulums that mark the time, we still can dream someone will come and cut us down. there is nothing here but words, the calls we try the dark with—hoping for a human ear, response, a rescue party. but all we hear is other voices like our own, other bodies tangled in the lines, the repetition of a cry from every tree:  i can’t help you, help me.

 milij balakirev 1837-1910, russian composer the black grand piano, the gleaming spider stood trembling in the midst of its music-net.  in the concert hall a land was emerging where the stones were no heavier than dew.  but balakirev fell asleep during the music and dreamed a dream about the tsar's carriage.  it rolled along over the cobblestones straight into the crow-cawing dark.  he sat alone in the cab and looked out but at the same time ran alongside in the road.  he knew that the trip had been long and his watch showed years, not hours.  there was a field where the plow lay and the plow was a bird taking flight.  there was a bay where the ship lay ice-bound, lights out, with people on deck.  the carriage glided across that ice and the wheels spun and spun with a sound of silk.  a lesser battleship:sevastopol. he was aboard. the crew came forward.  "you won't have to die if you can play." they showed him a peculiar instrument.  it looked like a tuba, or a phonograph, or a part to some obscure machine.  scared-stiff and helpless he understood: this is the instrument that drives the warship.  he turned to the sailor nearest him, desperately signaled with his hands and begged:  "make the sign of the cross like me, cross yourself!" the sailor stared somberly like a blind man,  stretched his arms out, sunk his head down— he hung as if nailed to the air.  the drums beat. the drums beat. applause! balakirev woke up from his dream.  the applause-wings pattered around the hall. he watched the man at the grand piano rise.  outside the streets lay blacked-out by the strike. the carriages rolled swiftly through the darkness.

 the whole ball of who we are presses into the green baize at a single tiny spot. an aural track of crackle betrays our passage through the fibrous jungle. it’s hot and desperate. insects spring out of it. the pressure is intense, and the sense that we’ve lost proportion. as though bringing too much to bear too locally were our decision.

 after you finish your work after you do your day after you've read your reading after you've written your say – you go down the street to the hot dog stand, one block down and across the way. on a blistering afternoon in east harlem in the twentieth century.  most of the windows are boarded up, the rats run out of a sack – sticking out of the crummy garage one shiny long cadillac; at the glass door of the drug-addiction center, a man who'd like to break your back. but here's a brown woman with a little girl dressed in rose and pink, too.  frankfurters frankfurters sizzle on the steel where the hot-dog-man leans – nothing else on the counter but the usual two machines, the grape one, empty, and the orange one, empty, i face him in between. a black boy comes along, looks at the hot dogs, goes on walking.  i watch the man as he stands and pours in the familiar shape bright purple in the one marked orange orange in the one marked grape, the grape drink in the machine marked orange and orange drink in the grape. just the one word large and clear, unmistakeable, on each machine.  i ask him : how can we go on reading and make sense out of what we read? – how can they write and believe what they're writing, the young ones across the street, while you go on pouring grape in orange and orange into the one marked grape –? (how are we going to believe what we read and we write and we hear and we say and we do?)  he looks at the two machines and he smiles and he shrugs and smiles and pours again. it could be violence and nonviolence it could be white and black          women and men it could be war and peace or any binary system, love and hate, enemy, friend. yes and no, be and not-be, what we do and what we don't do.  on a corner in east harlem garbage, reading, a deep smile, rape, forgetfulness, a hot street of murder, misery, withered hope, a man keeps pouring grape into orange and orange into the one marked grape, pouring orange into grape and grape into orange forever.

 up from the meadows rich with corn, clear in the cool september morn,  the clustered spires of frederick stand green-walled by the hills of maryland.  round about them orchards sweep, apple- and peach-tree fruited deep,  fair as a garden of the lord to the eyes of the famished rebel horde,  on that pleasant morn of the early fall when lee marched over the mountain wall,—  over the mountains winding down, horse and foot, into frederick town.  forty flags with their silver stars, forty flags with their crimson bars,  flapped in the morning wind: the sun of noon looked down, and saw not one.  up rose old barbara frietchie then, bowed with her fourscore years and ten;  bravest of all in frederick town, she took up the flag the men hauled down;  in her attic window the staff she set, to show that one heart was loyal yet.  up the street came the rebel tread, stonewall jackson riding ahead.  under his slouched hat left and right he glanced: the old flag met his sight.  “halt!”— the dust-brown ranks stood fast. “fire!”— out blazed the rifle-blast.  it shivered the window, pane and sash; it rent the banner with seam and gash.  quick, as it fell, from the broken staff dame barbara snatched the silken scarf;  she leaned far out on the window-sill, and shook it forth with a royal will.  “shoot, if you must, this old gray head, but spare your country’s flag,” she said.  a shade of sadness, a blush of shame, over the face of the leader came;  the nobler nature within him stirred to life at that woman’s deed and word:  “who touches a hair of yon gray head dies like a dog! march on!” he said.  all day long through frederick street sounded the tread of marching feet:  all day long that free flag tost over the heads of the rebel host.  ever its torn folds rose and fell on the loyal winds that loved it well;  and through the hill-gaps sunset light shone over it with a warm good-night.  barbara frietchie’s work is o’er, and the rebel rides on his raids no more.  honor to her! and let a tear fall, for her sake, on stonewall’s bier.  over barbara frietchie’s grave flag of freedom and union, wave!  peace and order and beauty draw round thy symbol of light and law;  and ever the stars above look down on thy stars below in frederick town!

 the cave looked much like any other from a little distance but as we approached, came almost to its mouth, we saw its walls within that slanted up into a dome were beating like a wild black lung— it was plastered and hung with the pulsing bodies of bats, the organ music of the body’s deep interior, alive, the sacred cave with its ten thousand gleaming eyes near the clustered rocks where the sea beat with the leather wings of its own dark waves.  below the bat-hung, throbbing walls, an altar stood, glittering with guano, a stucco sculpture like a gaudi church, berserk baroque, stone translated into flux—murk and mud and the floral extravagance of wet sand dripped from a giant hand, giving back blessing, excrement—return for the first fruits offered to the gods.  we stayed outside, superior with fear, like tourists peering through a door, whose hanging beads rattle in the air from one who disappeared into the dim interior; we thought of the caves of marabar, of a writer who entered and never quite emerged— the caves’ echoing black emptiness a tunnel in the english soul where he is wandering still. so the bat cave on the bali coast, not far from denpasar, holds us off, and beckons ...  standing there now, at the mouth of the cave—this time we enter, feel inside the flutter of those many hearts, the radiant heat of pumping veins, the stretch of wing on bone like a benediction, and the familiar faces of this many-headed god, benevolent as night is to the weary—the way at dark the cave releases them all, how they must lift like the foam on a wave breaking, how many they are as they enter the starlit air, and scatter in wild wide arcs in search of fruit, the sweet bites of mosquito ...  while the great domes of our own kind slide open, the eye that watches, tracks the skies, and the huge doors roll slowly back on the hangars, the planes push out their noses of steel, their wings a bright alloy of aluminum and death, they roar down the runways, tear into the night, their heavy bodies fueled from sucking at the hidden veins of earth; they leave a trail of fire behind them as they scar the air, filling the dreams of children, sleeping—anywhere, chicago, baghdad—with blood, as the bombs drop, as the world splits open, as the mothers reach for their own in the night of the falling sky, madness in method, nature gone into reverse ...  here, nearly unperturbed, the bats from the sacred cave fill the night with their calls, high-pitched, tuned to the solid world as eyes to the spectrum of light, gnats to the glow of a lamp—the bats circle, the clouds wheel, the earth turns pulling the dome of stars among the spinning trees, blurring the sweet globes of fruit, shaped exactly to desire—dizzy, we swing back to the cave on our stiff dark wings, the sweet juice of papaya drying on our jaws, home to the cave, to attach ourselves back to the pulsing dome, until, hanging there, sated and sleepy, we can see what was once our world upside down as it is and wonder whose altars those are, white, encrusted with shit.

 long after the sun falls into the sea and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet and the air gets soaked in blackness; long after clouds hover above like boulders and stars crawl up and stud the sky; long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter and fatigue blows in and bends them and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them, a girl unlatches a window, walks shoeless into a forest, her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness.  she walks into woods, her feet light-stepping through puddles, over hard packed dirt, through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled over lakes and frigid streams through dim cobbled streets darkened squares and dusty pastures. she runs from nothing, runs to nothing, beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings. in the dark the eyes of startled creatures gleam like a herd of candles. they scatter and give night its meaning.  what echo of a bell lulled her what spirit, what scent of a word whose storm wrote her what banks fell to drown her which blood star which thread of water which trickle of light whose heart being launched whose floating soul seduced her what promise did it make her whose memory burned her whose prayer did she run to answer whose help, what sorrow clot what pain dammed inside her what wall must she rebuild now whose treasure beckons her who spread ivy like a veil to blind her? daybreak lies chained to a blue wall from which the stars drop and lose all meaning.  she runs past villages that lost their names roads that lost their destinations seas that lost their compasses and sailors rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers houses that lost their sleepers and criers trees that lost their songs and shadows gardens that lost their violets and benches valleys that lost their worms and farmers mountains that lost their prophets and marauders temples that lost their sinners and spires lightning that lost its silver and wires chimeras that lost their bridges minotaurs that lost their fountains. crescent moons hover above her, ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless lost to their own meaning.  music rises out of her vision. it stands, a wall covered with silver mosses. a clarinet sounds a wounded mare, violins women who lost their children. flutes blow their hot dry breezes. drums chuckle the earth’s ceaseless laughter. pianos are mumbling sorcerers calling spirits and powers. cellos chew on the sounds of thunder. dulcimers skip about on crutches. dance floors flash their knives daring their dancers. words mill about the streets like orphans. then a lute begins groaning and dawn loses its meaning.  night girl, night girl your book is full now. you have drawn all the pictures. you have seen many weepers. stars held your sky in place and moons floated on your lakes and washed them. when a bird sings when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes when curtains are soaked with light when mirrors drown in shadows, take your day to the shore, my child. put out the words that fired your waking, scatter them on the sand like seeds, then with your feet gently tap them, and let the bright waves receive your meaning.

 light from the ugliest lamp i ever saw, here on the table that triples for reading, eating (can’t say dining), business on the phone; ugliest except a few around the corner in that guest house at windows  —plaster driftwood; cylinders like rockets or sanitary napkins propping shades; thin torso of a youth; red globe on orange globe, the works,somebody’s collection. wouldn’t she love this one, lump of lamp base  intending landscape, two donkeys in mustard glaze, heads ruefully down, one carrying two rush panniers large enough to hold your pens or salts and peppers; on the other a shifty man with droopy moustache rides,  **  grumping under his sombrero; right leg broken off at the knee, left leg clipped at ankle. they make no progress, this mold-made work—the joins, arthritic ridges where dabs of grayish green suggest  a wizened bush from which a brass post rises to hold a shade that doesn’t fit and twice has tried to burn, as crusty sores at the rim show. still, it lights my work. why hate it? do i care?  these indecorous furnishings stand for failure, are a clutter that weighs down, defeats the purpose, like dumbbells taken along on vacations; the pen jar; lamp base, sextant, portable folding triptych.  **  the writing table fills with clutter. specials coax me to nudge buying into play. a checkout coupon lets me get some brand of lunch meats fifty-five cents off if i spend two dollars  but i just can’t find it when i’m shopping, the ticket— with its rubric of good news and inscrutable forest of bar code, black on red—to lead me on; back home there it is, on the table, laying waste my power to spend.  what i have wanted (with larkin) to do must be “essentially undoable, it belongs to the imagination.” rather, the demolition has begun, piss and shit and blood mix in the snow-white bowl; and yet  **  i find the beech forest (behind the beach dunes) that allen recommended “without reservation.” the man was right—it more than satisfies, these beech ponds and their dune  forest. i sat on a pitch pine that had blown over and then turned round and risen again, and bowed part making a seat something like a saddle; the tree was growing while i sat on it  as were the other pitch pines round the pond ruddy in afternoon, late light of day, rough trunks with tufts of twisted branches green with needles, it was idyllic, wind speaking through the pines,  **  solitude:—o, yes, two high-breasted girls came striding by, i heard them coming, i heard them going, yammering at full volume not looking left or right, they passed me, were  out of sight and soon of earshot, doppler effect caused by exuberant youth in oblivious chitchat. and people are smoking in these dry woods too, not policing their butts is how i know,  the butts will surface from the heavier, sifting sand, sand spilling, surfing down hills, crashing in waves over the path here. but call it solitude, when a thought—but wait! i thought—i should not be  **  having a thought here, this moment: yet a vision of a chinese poet in his study overlooking such a pond as this arrives out of the silence like the yellow water lilies on the water, pads  spreading out in files like a design on the broadloom of a lobby. the sage is working on a poem, brushing it on silk, inspired by a blend of tao and confucius. doubtless he would not forget  allusions to sung poets, if he were not a sung poet himself, in which case he would have to echo han or t’ang; and he would be writing of solitude; time passing; absent friends  **  (enlightenment would have to be inferred). no matter, i didn’t bring a pen today. however, over there are inkberry bushes, so with a reed i just might make a start. . . . farther  on the path i listen to a bird, a warbler perhaps, i do not know the song or see the bird. there with the pines and sand and birdsong, and no prayer- or guide- or selfhelp-book, no  serious commune, the mind must yearn to be led on; it wants a deity, an altar to approach; an altar at least to take steps toward; occasion to rise to—with nothing planned for the mind,  **  it’s like a person suddenly blind, not blind for a long time and knowing the ropes, but just now, rope-stung, blind—and groping, feeling around for the way, any way, or, closer to home,  when the power goes at night just getting from here to there even though you know the drill, —you never find the batteries when you need them, groping down cellar for the circuit breaker then  you flip it; nothing, it’s a bigger failure you are part of— know the layout in general yet without ceremony the mind leans forward, over an edge, hoping for, needing a little ritual, like a guide rail to keep it  **  from falling, going down. even then the mind finds need of other news, keeps on desiring alterity somewhere at hand. for example, walking the streets of provincetown, nothing to see  but lots to look at, all that fluff and buff, the michelin-man day-trippers aching along; suddenly i want a prayer book, maybe not bottles and stools or the little red book but still . . .  even a pocket copy of a shropshire lad, such as i find soon after all the buff and fluff at tim’s, the only bookstore on the street, handy for quick reads. thin as a shortbread biscuit,  **  the richards press london 1915, no doubt with its khaki cover, intended for some tommy’s backpack, a backward solace for off-duty hours in the trenches: admittedly not very much  on the other hand just the thing i’m talking after; a talisman perhaps is all, an amulet with words that say,buck up, come on, you’ll make it, there’s something on after all this, no matter  what the words say. housman’s “vision,” his drear anguish of love for someone, something, lad and landscape that never were, that might shoot threads of gold among the bloody muslins and the mud;  **  mind wants other news than what the ruffled senses bring data of—smoke or flesh or birdsong. it saw there was a space within, reserved for turning toward another; other; that  no bullet, arrowwood or beach plum might fill, though these could occupy that space a moment. again i heard the casual chirping of that bird, off in that tupelo, the song  i did not know, below the cries of gull and jay i did. the unknown i saw was not enough to satisfy; or—satisfied when it was framed, complement of what is known for sure.  **  it’s—like—when you go someplace strange, new, the seashore, any boundary, you want to learn the names of plants. start looking at the edges of leaves. it gives a grip on where you are, and who, or seems to,  to know bullbrier, bearberry, blueberry. you get a guide or a local to tell. on the dune path i found one, a gnarled bush alone, hollylike but succulent leaf; nothing like it in the book. but why feel helped in nature  by a name? when a horde of flower children wanted to know what they should do to be saved (back when) snyder told them, “learn the names of plants; of animals; learn to do something with your hands.”  **  well i went out to that dune again: to cop a copy of the leaf i took and lost: so it’s only bayberry after all; dioecious, two-sexed: some leaves different from others, that’s ok only one got pictured  in my book; but the waxiness, bayberry for sure, set to be rendered into candles for a gifte shoppe, nauseating noose of “scents.” its nutlets twinkle near the oily leaves aglow above the sand,  bone white. doesn’t make me feel better to know now about that scrawny straggler. sanctimonious pilgrim know-alls, bradford &amp; co.! forest into desert, just like that. no time flat, considering.

 1    i gaze through a telescope at the orion nebula, a blue vapor with a cluster of white stars, gaze at the globular cluster in hercules, needle and pinpoint lights stream into my eyes. a woman puts a baby in a plastic bag and places it in a dumpster; someone parking a car hears it cry and rescues it. is this the little o, the earth? deer at dusk are munching apple blossoms; a green snake glides down flowing acequia water. the night is rich with floating pollen; in the morning, we break up the soil to prepare for corn. fossilized cotton pollen has been discovered at a site above six thousand feet. as the character yi, change, is derived from the skin of a chameleon, we are living the briefest hues on the skin of the world. i gaze at the sombrero galaxy between corvus and spica: on a night with no moon, i notice my shadow by starlight.   2    where does matter end and space begin?  blue jays eating suet;  juggling three crumbled newspaper balls wrapped with duct tape;  tasseling corn;  the gravitational bending of light;  “we're dying”;  stringing a coral necklace;  he drew his equations on butcher paper;  vanishing in sunlight;  sobbing;  she folded five hundred paper cranes and placed them in a basket;  sleeping in his room in a hammock;  they drew a shell to represent zero;  red persimmons;  what is it like to catch up to light?  he threw before completion: six in the third place, nine in the sixth.   3    a wavering line of white-faced ibises, flying up the rio grande, disappears. a psychic says, “search a pawnshop  for the missing ring.” loss, a black hole. you do not intend to commit a series of blunders, but to discover in one error  an empty cocoon. a weaver dumps flashlight batteries into a red-dye bath. a physicist says, “after twenty years,  nothing is as i thought it would be.” you recollect watching a yellow- and-black-banded caterpillar in a jar  form a chrysalis: in days the chrysalis lightened and became transparent: a monarch emerged and flexed its wings.  you are startled to retrieve what you forgot: it has the crunching sound of river breakup when air is calm and very clear.   4    beijing, 1985: a poet describes herding pigs beside a girl with a glass eye and affirms the power to dream and transform. later, in exile, he axes his wife and hangs himself. do the transformations of memory become the changing lines of divination? is the continuum of a moment a red poppy blooming by a fence, or is it a woman undergoing radiation treatment who stretches out on a bed to rest and senses she is stretching out to die? at night i listen to your breathing, guess at the freckles on your arms, smell your hair at the back of your neck. tiger lilies are budding in pots in the patio; daikon is growing deep in the garden. i see a bewildered man ask for direction, and a daikon picker points the way with a daikon.   5    he threw duration;  sunspots;  what is it like to catch up to light?  a collapsing vertebra;  the folding wings of a blue dragonfly;  receiving a fax;  buffeted on a floatplane between islands;  a peregrine falcon making a slow circle with outstretched wings;  he crumpled papers, threw them on the floor, called it city of bums;  polar aligning;  inhaling the smell of her hair;  a red handprint on a sandstone wall;  digging up ginseng;  carding wool;  where does matter end and space begin?   6    mushroom hunting at the ski basin, i spot a blood-red amanita pushing up under fir, find a white-gilled man on horseback, notice dirt breaking and carefully unearth a cluster of gold chanterelles. i stop and gaze at yellow light in a clearing. as grief dissolves and the mind begins to clear, an s twist begins to loosen the z twisted fiber. a spider asleep under a geranium leaf may rest a leg on the radial string of a web, but cool nights are pushing nasturtiums to bloom. an eggplant deepens in hue and drops to the ground. yellow specks of dust float in the clearing; in memory, a series of synchronous spaces. as a cotton fiber burns in an s twist and unravels the z twist of its existence, the mind unravels and ravels a wave of light, persimmons ripening on leafless trees.

 the little pitiful, worn, laughing faces, begging of life for joy!  i saw the little daughters of the poor, tense from the long day's working, strident, gay, hurrying to the picture-place. there curled a hideous flushed beggar at the door, trading upon his horror, eyeless, maimed, complacent in his profitable mask. they mocked his horror, but they gave to him from the brief wealth of pay-night, and went in to the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts thrown on the screen; in to the seeking hand covered by darkness, to the luring voice of horror, boy-masked, whispering of rings, of silks, of feathers, bought—so cheap!—with just their slender starved child-bodies, palpitant for beauty, laughter, passion, that is life: (a frock of satin for an hour's shame, a coat of fur for two days' servitude; “and the clothes last,” the thought runs on, within the poor warped girl-minds drugged with changeless days; “who cares or knows after the hour is done?”) —poor little beggars at life's door for joy! the old man crouched there, eyeless, horrible, complacent in the marketable mask that earned his comforts—and they gave to him!  but ah, the little painted, wistful faces questioning life for joy!

 since it always begins in the unlikeliest place we start in an obsolete country on no current map. the camera glides over flower beds, for this is a southern climate. we focus on medals, a horse, on a white uniform, for this is june. the young man waves to the people lining the road, he lifts a child, he catches a rose from a wrinkled woman in a blue kerchief. then we hear shots and close in on a casket draped in the austrian flag. thirty-one days torn off a calendar. bombs on belgrade; then europe explodes. we watch the trenches fill with men, the air with live ammunition. a close-up of a five-year-old living on turnips. her older sister, my not-yet-mother, already wearing my daughter’s eyes, is reading a letter as we cut to a young man with thick glasses who lies in a trench and writes a study of ibsen. i recognize him, he is going to be my father, and this is his way of keeping alive. snow. blood. lice. frostbite. grenades. stretchers. coffins. snow. telegrams with black borders. on the wide screen my father returns bringing his brother’s body; my mother’s father brings back his son’s from the opposite edge. they come together under the oaks of the cemetery. all who will be my family are here, except my sister, who is not yet imagined. neither am i, who imagine this picture, who now jump to my snowy birthday in the year of the million-mark loaf of bread. my early years are played by a blue-eyed child who grows up quickly, for this is a film of highlights, like all documentaries false to the life—the work of selective memory, all i can bear of a painful childhood. the swastika appears and remains as the huge backdrop against which we’re seen. the sound track of a hysterical voice is threatening us. we’re heard as whispers. shortly before my city bursts into flames, my stand-in disappears from the film, which continues with scenes of terror and death i can’t bear to watch. i pick up a new reel, a strange sequel set in a different location and made in another language, in which i am back. the colors are bright, the sound track is filled with music, the focus gentle. a man is beside me. time-lapse photography picks up the inchmeal growth of daughters toward the sky, the slow subversion of dark by gray hair. little happens. the camera sums up the even flow of many years in a shot of a river. the principals from part one are missing, except for me who am the connection. the time is now, and i am playing myself.

 the sun is high, the seaside air is sharp, and salty light reveals the mayan school. the irish hope their names are on the harp, we see the sheep's advertisement for wool, boulders are here, to throw against a tarp, from which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule. perceval seizes it and mounts it, then the blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again.  fateful connections that we make to things whose functioning's oblivious to our lives! how sidewise news of light from darkness springs, how blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives and make the honey while the queen bee sings leadbelly in arrangements by burl ives— how long ago i saw the misted pine trees and hoped, no matter how, to get them into poetry!  stendhal, at fifty, gazing as it happened on rome from the janiculum, decided that one way he could give his life a stipend was to suspend his being amour's fighter and get to know himself. here he had ripened accomplished, loved, and lived, was a great writer but never had explored in true detail his childhood and his growing up. so he set sail  composing la vie de henry brulard  but in five hundred pages scarcely got beyond his seventeenth year, for it is hard to take into account what happens here and fit it all onto an index card. even one moment of it is too hot, complex and cannibalistically connected to every other, which is what might be expected.  sterne's hero has a greater problem, never getting much past his birth. i've had a third one. my autobiography, if i should ever start out to write it, quickly seems a burden an i-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor. whatever life i do write's an absurd one as if some crazy person with a knife cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life.  in any case a life that's hardly possible in the conditions that we really live in, where easy flying leaps to inaccessible mountainy places where love is a given and misery, if there, infinitesimal, are quite the norm. here none by pain is driven that is not curable by the romanza that's kept in readiness to finish any stanza.  whatever, then, i see at this late stage of my life i may or may not have stayed ignorant of that great book i've strained to write one page of yet always hoping my page was significant. be it or not, for me and for the ages i leave it as it is. yet as a figurant who has not stopped, i'm writing in addition more lines to clarify my present disposition.  one person in a million finds out something perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge. newton, copernicus, einstein are cunning. the rest of us just rise and go to college with no more hope to come home with the bunting than a stray dachshund going through the village. however, what a treat our small successes of present and of past, at various addresses!  to be in all those places where i tarried too little or too late or bright and early to love again the first woman i married to marvel at such things as melancholy, sophistication, drums, a baby carriage, a john cage concert heard at alice tully— how my desire when young to be a poet made me attentive and oblivious every moment!  do you remember oceanview the fair? the heights above the river? the canoes? the place we beached them and the grass was bare? those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce? the crooked line of pantry shelves, with pear and cherry jam? and pancho, with his noose? do you remember full and half and empty? do you remember sorrow standing in the entry?  do you remember thought, and talking plainly? michel and i went walking after chartres cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly by giving us an insight into barthes. michel said he was capable of feigning renewed intentions of the soul's deep part, like this cathedral's artificial forces that press a kind of artless thought into our faces.  and yet— the moor is dark beneath the moon. the porcupine turns over on its belly and new conceptions rap at the cocoon. civilization, dealing with us fairly, for once, releases its erectheion of understanding, which consoles us, nearly. later we study certain characteristics that may give us a better chance with the statistics.  how much i'd like to live the whole thing over, but making some corrections as i go! to be a better husband and a father, be with my babies on a sled in snow. by twenty i'd have understood my mother and by compassion found a way to know what separates the what-i-started-out-as from what-i-sometimes-wished-i-was-when-in-the-mountains.  to be once more the one who what was worthy of courtship courted—it was quite as stressful as trying to, er, as they say, give birth to a poem and as often unsuccessful, but it was nice to be sublime and flirty with radiant girls, and, in some strange way, restful. i could be everything i wasn't usually— and then to get somebody else to feel it mutually!  in poems the same problem or a similar. desire of course not only to do old things but things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors and of the melancholy finch be co-finch in singing songs with such a broad parameter that seamstresses would stare, forget to sew things, astronauts quit the sky, athletes the stadium to hear them, and the rest of what they hear be tedium.  such wild desires, i think it's recognizable are part and parcel of the human image and in a way, i'd say, no less predictable than popeye's feelings for a can of spinach. yet if we're set on course by the invisible, all pre-determined, what about the language that teases me each morning with its leanings toward the unprogrammed altitudes beyond its meanings?  are you, o particles, o atoms, nominatives like percevals and stendhals, set in motion by some ordaining will that is definitive? is this invading chill and high emotion, this tendency to know one is regenerative, is this, all, tidal take-home like the ocean? be what you may, my thanks for your society through the long life i've had, your jokes and your variety,  the warmth you've shown in giving me a temperature that i can live with, and the strength you've shared with me in arms and legs—and for your part in literature, what can i say? it is as if life stared at me and kissed my lips and left it as a signature. thank you for that, and thank you for preparing me for love itself, and friendship, its co-agent. thank you for being this, and for its inspiration.

 old now, your eyes nearly blank from plotting the light's movement over the years, you clean your almanac and place it next to the heart of this letter. i have you in mind, giving a final brush and twist to the difficult pages, staring down the shape of the numbers as though you would find a flaw in their forms. solid, these calculations verify your body on god's earth. at night, the stars submit themselves to the remembered way you turn them; the moon gloats under your attention. i, who know so little of stars, whose only acquaintance with the moon is to read a myth, or to listen to the surge of songs the women know, sit in your marvelous reading of all movement, of all relations.  so you look into what we see yet cannot see, and shape and take a language to give form to one or the other, believing no form will escape, no movement appear, nor stop, without explanation, believing no reason is only reason, nor without reason. i read all of this into your task, all of this into the uneasy reproof of your letter.  surely, there must be a flaw. these perfect calculations fall apart. there are silences that no perfect number can retrieve, omissions no perfect line could catch. how could a man but challenge god's impartial distributions? how could a man sit among the free and ordered movements of stars, and waters, beasts and birds, each movement seen or accounted for, and not know god jealous, and not know that he himself must be?  so you go over the pages again, looking for the one thing that will not reveal itself, judging what you have received, what you have shaped, believing it cannot be strange to the man you address. but you are strange to him —your skin, your tongue, the movement of your body, even your mysterious ways with stars. you argue here with the man and god, and know that no man can be right, and know that no god will argue right. your letter turns on what the man knows, on what god, you think, would have us know. all stars will forever move under your gaze, truthfully, leading you from line to line, from number to number, from truth to truth, while the man will read your soul's desire, searcher, searching yourself, losing the relations.

 home, then, where the past was. then, where cold pastorals repeated their entreaties, where a portrait of christ hung in every bedroom. then was a different country in a different climate in a time when souls were won and lost in prairie tents. it was. it was. then it was a dream. i had no will there. then the new continent and the new wife and the new language for no, for unsaved, for communion on credit. then the daughter who should’ve been mine, and the hour a shadow outgrew its body. she was all of my failures, my sermon on the tender comforts of hatred in the shape of a girl. then the knowledge of god like an apple in the mouth. i faced my temptation. i touched its breasts with as much restraint as my need allowed, and i woke with its left hand traced again and again on my chest like a cave wall disfigured by right-handed gods who tried to escape the stone. it was holy. it was fading. my ring, then, on my finger like an ambush, as alive as fire. then the trees offered me a city in the shape of a word followed by a word followed by a blue madonna swinging from the branches. a choir filed out of the jungle singing hallelujah like a victory march and it was.

 old court. old chain net hanging in frayed links from the rim, the metal blackboard dented, darker where the ball for over thirty years has kissed it, the blacktop buckling, the white lines nearly worn away. old common ground where none of the black men warming up before the basket will answer or even look in my direction when i ask if i can run too, the chill a mutual understanding, one of the last we share, letting me join them here, if nowhere else, by not letting me forget i don’t belong.  old court. old courtesy, handshake, exchange of names, in the early days of bussing, between assassinations, before our quaint welcoming of them had come to seem, even to ourselves, the haughty overflow of wealth so thoroughly our own we didn’t need to see it. old beautiful delusion in those courtly gestures that everything now beyond our wanting just to play was out of bounds, and we were free between the white lines of whatever we assumed we each of us assumed.  old court, old dream dreamed by the weave, the trap, the backdoor pass. old fluid legacy, among the others, that conjures even now within our bodies and between them such a useless, such an intimate forgetting, as in the moment when you get a step on your defender and can tell exactly by how another man comes at you where your own man is and, without looking, lob the ball up in the air so perfectly as he arrives that in a single motion he can catch and finger roll it in.  old court. old dwindling cease fire, with no hope of peace, that we silently turn away from when the game is over, hurrying back (as if believing contact meant contagion) to our separate tribes, to the cleansing fires of what, despite ourselves, we momentarily forgot: old lore, old news, old burning certitudes we can’t stoke high or hot enough, yet won’t stop ever stoking until whatever it is we think we are anneals and toughens into an impenetrable shield.

 on the birthday of the world i begin to contemplate what i have done and left undone, but this year not so much rebuilding  of my perennially damaged psyche, shoring up eroding friendships, digging out stumps of old resentments that refuse to rot on their own.  no, this year i want to call myself to task for what i have done and not done for peace. how much have i dared in opposition?  how much have i put on the line for freedom? for mine and others? as these freedoms are pared, sliced and diced, where  have i spoken out? who have i tried to move? in this holy season, i stand self-convicted of sloth in a time when lies choke  the mind and rhetoric bends reason to slithering choking pythons. here i stand before the gates opening, the fire dazzling  my eyes, and as i approach what judges me, i judge myself. give me weapons of minute destruction. let my words turn into sparks.

 openly, yes, with the naturalness of the hippopotamus or the alligator when it climbs out on the bank to experience the  sun, i do these things which i do, which please no one but myself.  now i breathe and now i am sub- merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object  in view was a renaissance; shall i say the contrary?  the sediment of the river which encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but i am used  to it, it may remain there; do away with it and i am myself done away with, for the patina of circumstance can but enrich what was  there to begin with.  this elephant skin which i inhabit, fibered over like the shell of the coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light  can filter—cut into checkers by rut upon rut of unpreventable experience— it is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the  hairy toed.  black but beautiful, my back is full of the history of power.  of power?  what is powerful and what is not?  my soul shall never  be cut into by a wooden spear; through- out childhood to the present time, the unity of life and death has been expressed by the circumference  described by my trunk; nevertheless, i perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after all; and i am on my guard; external poise, it  has its centre well nurtured—we know where—in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where ? my ears are sensitized to more than the sound of  the wind.  i see and i hear, unlike the wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made to see and not to see; to hear and not to hear,  that tree trunk without roots, accustomed to shout its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact by who knows what strange pressure of the  atmosphere; that  spiritual brother to the coral plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light becomes a nebulous green.  the i of each is to  the i of each, a kind of fretful speech which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is? black earth preceded by a tendril?  it is to that  phenomenon the above formation, translucent like the atmosphere—a cortex merely— that on which darts cannot strike decisively the first  time, a substance needful as an instance of the indestructibility of matter; it has looked at the electricity and at the earth-  quake and is still here; the name means thick.  will depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no beautiful element of unreason under it?

 dark as the clouds of even, ranked in the western heaven, waiting the breath that lifts all the dread mass, and drifts tempest and falling brand over a ruined land;— so still and orderly, arm to arm, knee to knee, waiting the great event, stands the black regiment.  down the long dusky line teeth gleam and eyeballs shine; and the bright bayonet, bristling and firmly set, flashed with a purpose grand, long ere the sharp command of the fierce rolling drum told them their time had come, told them what work was sent for the black regiment.  “now,” the flag-sergeant cried, “though death and hell betide, let the whole nation see if we are fit to be free in this land; or bound down, like the whining hound,— bound with red stripes of pain in our old chains again!” oh, what a shout there went from the black regiment!  “charge!” trump and drum awoke, onward the bondmen broke; bayonet and sabre-stroke vainly opposed their rush. through the wild battle’s crush, with but one thought aflush, driving their lords like chaff, in the guns’ mouths they laugh; or at the slippery brands leaping with open hands, down they tear man and horse, down in their awful course; tramping with bloody heel over the crashing steel, all their eyes forward bent, rushed the black regiment.  “freedom!” their battle-cry— “freedom! or leave to die!” ah! and they meant the word, not as with us ’tis heard, not a mere party shout: they gave their spirits out; trusted the end to god, and on the gory sod rolled in triumphant blood.  glad to strike one free blow, whether for weal or woe; glad to breathe one free breath, though on the lips of death. praying—alas! in vain!— that they might fall again, so they could once more see that burst to liberty! this was what “freedom” lent to this black regiment.  hundreds on hundreds fell; but they are resting well; scourges and shackles strong never shall do them wrong.  oh, to the living few, soldiers, be just and true! hail them as comrades tried; fight with them side by side; never, in field or tent, scorn the black regiment.

NEW POEM
 sonnet 19 (on his blindness) by john milton 1. spent  in sonnet 19, milton makes the seemingly deliberate choice to avoid “the” and “a” — respectively, the most common and the sixth most common words in english usage. instead of these articles —  definite and indefinite — the poem stages a territorial dispute between  possessives: the octave is “my” land, the sestet is “his” land, with the occasional “this” or “that” flagging no man’s land. we come to understand milton’s mistake — the professed regret of the poem — as this act of claiming. it is only through his taking possession that the universal light is divided up, apportioned into “my light” — a finite commodity that by being subjected to ownership becomes capable of being “spent.”  “spent” — a word like a flapping sack.  my mistake was similar. i came to consider my body — its tug-of-war of tautnesses and slacknesses — to be entirely my own, an appliance for generating various textures and temperatures of friction. should i have known, then, that by this act of self-claiming, i was cutting  myself off from the eternal, the infinite, that i had fashioned myself into a resource that was bounded and, therefore, exhaustible?  2. wide  the “wide” is always haunted by surprise. in a dark world, the “wide” is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness, the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs. to be bounded is our usual condition; to be open is anomalous, even excessive.  a wide-eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness, her bare membranes flinching at any contact, vulnerable to motes, to smuts, to dryness. a wide-hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide. a wide-legged girl unseals a portal between persons; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers, a trapdoor that must be shut for safety’s sake. a wide-eyed girl is often thought desirable; a wide-hipped girl is often thought eligible; a wide-legged girl is often thought deplorable. a wide-legged girl is rarely wide-eyed, though she may have started out that way.  we can understand why milton, in the narrowing orbit of his blindness, would have considered wideness, unboundedness to be threatening. what’s less clear is why the wideness of the wide-legged girl is also considered threatening. does the wideness of the wide-legged girl evoke a kind of blindness, a dark room where one might blunder into strangers, the way two men once met each other in me?  3. hide  “but why hide it in a hole?” asks the master, returning from his long absence, sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage.  an unanswered question worries at the parable of the talents: why is the master so terribly angry? it is not as if the servant had stolen the money, or spent it—his sin is one of omission, of overly risk-averse investing. a talent was a unit of weight in ancient greece: in monetary terms, it was worth eighty pounds of silver, or 6,000 denarii—nearly twenty years’ wages for the average worker. but milton uses the word in its more modern sense, dating from the fifteenth century: a natural ability or skill.  how did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn, innate? confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem. the master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed. was the servant’s fault to confuse coins for seeds, did he think he was planting when he was merely burying, did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living, what had never been alive?  4. bent  and what about the hole, which for so long had held treasure? did it wonder why — despite all the moistness and richness it could muster — those cold, glinting seeds never sprouted? did it understand that, if released into the wider world, the coins could have quickened, multiplied? that instead of an incubator, the hole had become an oubliette, a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish, to become lodged, useless?  “useless” — a word like a capped lead pipe, like the extra bone in my foot i will never pass down to my daughter.  a thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape. to “get bent” is to be put to another kind of use, a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape. to bend is to be bound, to bow down without breaking, with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward.  5. present  the master has become the maker. the servile body wholly “his,” splayed wide in a welcome-home, bound up in a beribboned bow.  but the reader will object. this is all wrong. first of all, in the sonnet, “bent” doesn’t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force, but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination. second, a “present” is not a gift, but a verb meaning to offer openly, full-faced, the sun beaming down on a clean page. third, the body never comes into it at all.  “therewith” — a safe word, a strongbox to be buried.  6. chide  is a “true account” a story or a sum? is the maker an audience or an auditor?  the page scoured white by little grains of fear.  a story has an ending. a sum has a bottom line. there was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me, month after month, i scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime.  then one day the fear reversed itself. like a photo negative but in higher contrast—its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy, as if a whisper-thin suspicion had come unzipped.  “chide” is an enormous understatement. the servant isn’t merely scolded, he is cast into “the outer darkness” where there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” if the “outer darkness” is deemed to be a punishment, then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward?  7. denied  it seems unfair, is milton’s point. to be assigned a task, but not provided sufficient materials to complete it, is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity, like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale.  the parable of the wise and foolish virgins—which prefaces the parable of the talents — centers on this scarcity. the virgins wait for the bridegroom, to greet him with lamps alight. five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil, but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil. that much we are told, but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story. why isn’t the bridegroom with the bride? why is he so delayed? why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp-bearing virgins, like a troupe of pom-pom girls or like a sacrificial rite?  the virginity of the virgins renders them piquant, memorable. adorning gothic portals, evoking thresholds, entrances, they are a particular feature of french cathedrals—much more so, one suspects, than if the parable had called them “maidservants” or even “bridesmaids.”  the presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much: the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast, the smug, unctuous faces of the wise virgins. instead, the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night, their desperation making them vulnerable, their vulnerability making them erotic, the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. is this how i was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out?  8. prevent  “prevent” — a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth.  a white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away, leaving a star-shaped scar.corpus albicans, the whitening body. such starbursts, at first, are scattered constellations, frost embroidering a dark field. but at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility, opacity, obstacle—the ice disc clogging the round pond, the grid of proteins baffling the eye?  “prevent” — a word that slams shut, a portcullis (latin:cataracta).  letter to leonard philaras, september 28, 1654: “the dimness which i experience by night and day, seems to incline more to white than to black.”  9. need  has patience been looming in the background all along, silent, so as not to intrude upon a blind man’s consciousness? patience, whose garment is “white and close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind.”  at the turn of the sonnet, patience pries open its sculpted lips, its stiff tongue like a weaver’s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of milton’s blindness, a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder.  milton’s little murmur stitched back into his mouth.  woven tight enough to repel need — a liquid beading on the surface, the blood the needles drew from me week after week, hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin, en route to the incinerator.  “need,” from the high german, for danger.  “murmur,” from the sanskrit, a crackling fire.  10. best  the best beam in contentment, ranging themselves in rows. erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness, mustering shoulder-to-shoulder with the fellow-elect. the best arrayed in regimental ranks, in refrigerated racks, white hymn of the unneeded, white hum of the unneeding.  “best,” originally superlative of bot(old english: remedy, reparation).  the best affect a pious pose, mouths held taut in tongueless os.sotto voce chorus of that soft, subjunctive song:if you were complete ... if you were replete ...  superlative. the most remediated. the most repaired.  11. state  to be scooped out, emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears, pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table. enucleated, the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk.  “yolk” from geolu(old english: yellow). not to be confused with “yoke” from geocian(old english: to be joined together). a yoke is an implement, meant to be used, to fill a need. but where there is no field to be plowed, no wagon to be pulled, why demand a yoke that is useless, needless?  one day the romans sent for cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading aequian army. he laid down his plow in the field and went to war. when the aequians surrendered, cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must “pass under the yoke.” the romans fashioned a yoke from three spears, two fixed in the ground, and one tied across the tops of the two verticals. since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground, the aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender. this is thought to be the origin of the word “subjugate,” to be brought under the yoke. to bear a yoke is to be bowed down, oxbowed, cowed.  one day they laid me down on a gurney, my feet strapped in stirrups, my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull.  12. speed  but why would milton, of all people, use the word “kingly” as a compliment? roundheaded milton, who wrote tract after tract in defense of regicide, who would later be detained for opposing the restoration?  at this point, our suspicions are confirmed: milton has disappeared entirely from the poem. we haven’t heard from him since the turn of the sonnet. we’ve been lulled by the cadenced voice of patience, its dusty tongue self-lubricating, its pallid breath clouding the room, precipitating frangible chains of hydrocarbons, their branchings barbed like fluffs of eiderdown. through the faint reticulations, we discern no dark stoop-shouldered figure, but only white-robed forms, upright as if hung from hooks, their faces unyielding as lanterns, shuttered as if once aflame.  13. rest  rest — a word like a gauze bandage, a ropy weave of collagen knitting its way across a wound. outspread as if fingered, gelid gestures suggesting solace: to stanch, to shield, to seal, to shut off.  rest — the rind of the best, a contoured pod that cradles the shape of what it doesn’t hold.  rest — those who are left when thousands have sped away, the bereft, who litter the land, with husks for hands, vacant-eyed, vacant faces raised like basins under a contrail-scarred sky.  14. wait  to stand and wait is a task far weightier than simply to wait. it is to permit the distractible body neither ease nor action, nor food nor drink nor any such reprieve; it is to pit the body in enmity against its own heaviness.  to abide in readiness as in a winter orchard, the lacerated land bandaged in snow. to exist inert as if limbless, skin seamless as if reknit over what had been pruned away, knotted rootstock fit for no other service: no branch, no leaf, no fruit. to persist as a stripped stick persists in a white field, bark peeled back from one exposed split, uptilted as if eager for the grafted slip.  to stand and wait for the one who reaps where he has not sown.  mercy sugars the starving soil with nitrogen, potassium, phosphate. mercy captures rain in silver beads and stitches them through the threadbare weave of cloud. mercy wields a scalpel cutting a cleft in the lopped-off stump, mercy forces home the rootless wand, mercy seals the join with tar and tape.  to foster the raw scion as if it were a son, to siphon light down through its body as if it were your own.

(for a better view, go to ayala avenue in makati. in front of the bank of the philippine islands and the insular life building is the statue with the stairs and the dove on his shoulder. while you're there, look for the statues of lapu lapu and tandang sora among the ipil-ipil trees on makati avenue.)  you pass through a fluorescent-white curtain of warm air as you descend into the unloading tube— a smile from an airline attendant, the long walk to the immigration booth,  balikbayan sir?welcome home.  a stamp for six months on your u.s. passport, another ten dollar bill between its pages for the customs people up ahead,  balikbayan? do you have anything to declare, pasalubong, expensive gifts for the relatives? thank you sir!  a porter in a red shirt takes your luggage to the street level, asks for five dollars, the faces of a hundred people pressed behind a bamboo fence stare as you board a golden or metro taxi cab.  you inhale the humid air, sweat is now running down your face.  2. e. de los santos avenue the jeepnies are engorged with eight or ten passengers, each jeepney speeding and stopping with their fiesta of sounds, of colors, the bodies inside breathing carbon monoxide.  you take the overpass into makati— to the right is the long tan wall topped with barbed-wire hiding the luxury homes of dasmarinas village, to the left is san lorenzo village where you'll find the san lorenzo pre-school. go to the house in zulueta circle, this is where the poet of like the molave once lived. his widow's name is cora.  on the corner of edsa and buendia, among the street vendors selling copies of woman's day, manila bulletin, or marlboro and winston cigarettes, you might see a girl without a left arm tapping on windows of stopped cars pointing to her mouth, asking for money. every other year, before the monsoon rains, it's the same arm that's cut off just above the elbow, a different young face running up to cars in the same intersection.  3. camp crame and camp aguinaldo you pass camp crame where ninoy aquino, jose maria sison, the poet mila d. aguilar, and countless others were "detained" under marcos. the positive wire attached to the penis, the negative to the scrotum. this is also the place where more than a million people said "no" to the dictator. you may still hear stories about the tear gas, the armored personnel vehicles, the ordinary people who would not move out of the way. they say that for three days the electricity to the whole city was turned off but the people still fought for freedom, sang songs to each other around bonfires, made love by candle light.

 you might make a choice between what descends with these tiles lined before you, or arcing forward through a history that is constant against us. a bridge to block out the dawn. or monoxide that passes like breath. my breath. i know all about what’s underground, and i keep my searches for the invisible there. in the park above, you’ve got your bike locked and the chain cut. the stubborn part doesn’t say anything, doesn’t need to to start marching home, ugly block, block of shouting, block syrupy with flies. i would like to hear about it, but i am backed into an argument myself on a coil of cool fall breeze, backed through seasons into the past, home or near it, in the moment when i’m as right as i’ll ever be bled into i’ll be this right forever. there’s no out available for this character, just a decade producing the present, warm, and then warmer around him. it was as if i hadn’t seen the harbor, didn’t want to admit it by doing so now. something like a pile of books falls over inside me or the room i’m in breaks off from the house, slides almost out of view. all things didn’t happen or did. you might’ve routed a highway so it crashes through the seventh floor of a skyscraper, and the moment for that passes by us still. you can live like a column of light pours over you, but that’s not all you’ll see.

 “we do not dig graves or put caskets into graves any longer. the decision was made and funeral homes were notified that families andfuneral homes would have to supply grave-digging personnel.” —ed mazoue, new orleans city real estate administrator and person in charge of the city’s cemeteries    there’s nothing but mud. the ground looks dry and firm, but underneath is a stew of storm. stout shovels, rusted, grow gummed and heavy with what i heft and rearrange.  progress is slow.  the sun so often steams me shut, and i have to stop to gulp sugared bites of tea, flick away sweat with my swollen fingers, swat hard at sluggish flies who hover,  like they know.  and when i start again, there’s a rhythm to it, some ticking jazz that gets my square hips involved. i craft a chant purely for downbeat: plunge.   push.   lift.   toss it. plunge.   push.   lift.   toss it. my untried muscles blaze, joints click, pulse clutches my chest.  whole clocks later, i pause to relish the feat, to marvel at the way i’ve compromised the earth, how i’ve been that kind of god for a minute. but only time has moved. it’s like trying to reach the next world with a spoon.  my boy would have laughed. daddy, you better sit down and watch some ball game, and we’d settle, sunday lazy, his squirm balanced on my belly.  he needed what i was and what i wasn’t. giggling in little language, he lobbed me the ball soft, walked slower when i was at his side, shared puffed white bread and purple jelly. he waited patiently for me after dark while i shuffled piles of books, looking for a bedtime drama of spacemen or soldiers, some crayoned splash to wrap his day around.  but every night, when i opened the door to his room, all i saw was a quivering mountain of snoopys, blues, and scoobys. underneath them, his happy body could barely cage breath. giggles unleashed his toes. my line, then:where are yoooou?  plunge.   push.   lift.   toss it.  plunge.   push.   lift.   toss—  with the dirt balanced high, screaming my shoulder, i think hard on those nights of tussle and squeal. i want to feel his heat and twist in my arms again.  i have to dig.

 last time i had stamina and calluses and a bag of chalk. it hung from my lumbar like a bunny tail. last time i was lighter and the ether better-emptied. now blood is so close to my surface i slip off the walls.  tonight is the night of a massacre i do not look at. although i have been to that city of bricks and black blooms. therein i kissed a grave a million others kissed. a woman with a cigarette asked me for fire there and i provided it. i had been asked for light before but never fire.  tonight i climb three hundred stairs toward the light of my device. maybe we’ll be wartime people leading wartime lives. skirmishes have sprung from the heads of lesser gods.  this is the light no one reads by we just stare into it. we wait for the glyphs that mean it is safe.

 for doug fieger (d. 2010), berton averre, prescott niles and  bruce gary (d. 2006) the men don’t know growls willie dixon’s most famous tune, but the version i prefer—low fidelity cassette bootleg, howling tin sound with shredded paper drums—remains unreleased, recorded not by some venerable mississippi blues curmudgeon whose name, artfully dropped here, would evoke afternoons porch-sitting with magnolia wine and box-string guitar, or might bestow upon me some sorely lacking hipster bonafides. that’s never going to happen, since i am talking here about a nearly unlistenable cover, the monophonic noise and mid-range screech of the knack, live in hollywood, before a packed house at the troubador, july 1979. so what if i was twelve? i’d already gotten it, learned how to pluck out the gallop of my sharona’ s bass, hoping someday i’d ace out doug fieger and be sharona’s back door man myself, though i’d have been better off learning how to get in the front door first. which was the vaguest country, women, or the blues? i did not know. i still might not. i only knew what i was learning: that a song could actually sound like sweat; that ray manzarek, gangly ray best known as the piano-playing witness to greatness, had dropped by to sit in, and when he’d come down wonderland avenue it was a benediction, as if to say,hey, these guys are all right, forgive them their sins of leather tie and beatle boot. so i want to say thank you to whatever thought to tape that show, because it taught me that i wanted a forever girl like sharona, who, as the 45-rpm picture sleeve promised, played the coolest records for her slumber-partying girlfriends, who all looked like the camisoled girls in the runaways or the equally fated go-gos. but i am getting ahead of myself, since, as leonard cohen says, everybody knows how this story ends. i have everything the knack ever recorded, including this version of back door man, which tells me everything that was wrong with 1979, and later, everything wrong with me. how does the show end? listen to the cassette, a moment in unsteady time, the zapruder film of the skinny tie era. for the band, you know how it ends already: rehab, divorce, rehab, forgiveness, comeback tour, state fair nostalgia; immortal sharona—her real name —sells real estate, million-dollar homes. that’s what those little girls do, they grow up, which reminds me my sharona, that set-closing number, may be the saddest story i know.

 the animal of winter is dying, its white body everywhere in collapse and stabbed at by straws of   light, a leaving to believe in as the air slowly fills with darkness and water drains from the tub where my daughter, watching it lower around her, feeling it go, says about the only thing she can as if it were a long- kept breath going with her blessing of dribble and fleck. down it swirls a living drill vanishing toward a land where tomorrow already fixes its bright eye on a man muttering his way into a crowd, saying about the only thing he can before his body goes boom. and tomorrow, i will count more dark shapes tumbling from the sky, birds returning to scarcity, offering in their seesawing songs a kind of   liquidity.

 the evidence was in and it went to the contrary. the contrary wound around us rather like a river. the river reacted, spider-like, tangling up its legs with other wet parts we thought we knew, such as creeks and fjords and deltas and such.  a beaver sits on the riverbank watching all of this unfold. he doesn’t know what a fjord is, and he doesn’t care for other waters, or even other beavers, or the merest hint of other business, so he removes this evidence.  then he builds a structure which for years he is rehabbing. inside it is hollow and there is his nest. he is a dark little bastard, all the same. the water had a fine way of   being, now it is tortured by these nests and their vassal.  yet the river doesn’t overthrow the beaver. quite the contrary. the river goes around polite as a snake. it argues a tiny bit at the edges of the lodge, where young beavers could be napping.  you and i would let loose a flood of tears. not the river. you and i would seep hotly into our darkest places. not the river. it is a long way from home and has that on its mind, the day of rising, when the temples will all be cleansed and the whole unfathomable truth will out.  according to the waters. according to their book.

 this is the track i've had on repeat all afternoon:      she is butterfly brilliant riband, rice flour face, silken, even her voice a sashed kimono  if i were foolish like her: but aren't i foolish like her spotting the coil of smoke and the billowed sail against the verge of sky  simple on the rise surveying the anchorage:      simple me, signal me dreading the confident assumption of return, dreading more uncertain tone to come, the thinning notes, performance too close to my own impatient—swells, a surge:      sick wind  but the emotion is, after all, an artfully conjured gesture arranged marriage between a past ache and frail woodwinds i could skip ahead could break the inconsolable loop of harbor, waiting, overlook, waiting, inevitable waning eye  troubled robins, once more in the handkerchief trees once more, brief aquarelle of triplet lilies, blue as willowware in that interval before his embrace falters, stuck, founders [shuffle play]    such a pitch of tenderness in the voice such an awful lot of noise

 they had questioned him for hours. who exactly was he? and when he told them, they questioned him again. when they accepted who he was, as someone not involved, they pulled out his fingernails. then they took him to a waste-ground somewhere near the horseshoe bend, and told him what he was. they shot him nine times.  a dark umbilicus of smoke was rising from a heap of burning tyres. the bad smell he smelt was the smell of himself. broken glass and knotted durex. the knuckles of a face in a nylon stocking. i used to see him in the gladstone bar, drawing pints for strangers, his almost perfect fingers flecked with scum.

 how did you come how did i come here now it is ours, how did it come to be in so many presences? some i know swept from the sea, wind and sea, took up the right wave in their fins and seal suits, rode up over the town to this shore shining and sleek to be caught by a tide as of music, or color, or shape in the heart of the sea. was it you?  was it you who came out from the sea-floor as lab into lab weightless, each breath bubbling to surface, swaying in currents of kelp plants, came in your cars freewayed in valleys millions of miles from the shore to converge where the highways converge saying welcome to here, and to where? to tape and percussion, raga computers, rare texts and components of clay, with the sea down away past the freeways and out of the town to the blockbusting towers of learning and quiet shades of administering redwood, azure dome over all like a bellflower and star above star.  did you come out of borderlands dear to the south speaking a language riveran, nerudan, and saying aqui estáun hombre; my first lesson? and come as quixote, the man of romance in its new century, tilting at windmill giants of concrete, slim lance at the ready? woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be alone in the midst of the earth. did you come with a handful of questions leaping like jewels to shock answers, to start sparks of inquiry into the evening air? i came as a kid from the midwest all recognize as part of home, to this another which the salt sea answered in its time and viscaino mapped his ports upon. you came as concertmaster of hte philharmonic as mayor of del mar as reader of magnetic messages in dna as archivist for the time’s poetry, or pta, as land-grant scholar holding his gray moon rocks.  what is this that we come to, its walls and corridors gaping in space, its north lights seeking the north, its substance concrete brushed by the grains of its boards, its boards reaching extension in all of their lenghts in architectural solidity? it is a break in the galaxies of our imagination. it needs our lives to make it live.  a building, a dark hole in space, compact of matter, draws into it buzzing disinterests, idelologies. incomplete being enters into the dense room, emerges another, further, compact of matter, this is the place that we enter, it paints pictures here and plays drums. it turns us around and we emerge out of old space into the universe. this building between buildings as between galaxies, between fields as between flights of fancy, will reshape our ears and turn us, our work of art beating in the breast like a heart.  what are we here for? to err, to fail and attempt as terribly as possible, to try stunts of such magnitude they will lead to disasters of such magnitude they will lead to learnings of such magnitude they will lend back in enterprise to substance and grace. what learning allows for is the making of error without fatality. the wandering off, the aberration, distortion and deviation by which to find again the steady center and moving center. what art allows for is the provisional enactments of such learning in their forms of color and line, of mass and energy, of sound and sense which bulk disaster large, create evil to look it in the eye. to forge villainies of the wars, to indispose villainies of petty establishment to make them lead their lives in sound and sense to no good end, that we may see them so. to make mistakes all of our own mistakes out of the huddle of possibilities into a color and form which will upbraid them beyond their being.  give us to err grandly as possible in this complete complex of structure, risk a soul nobly in north light, in cello tone, in action of drastic abandonment, that we return to what we have abandoned and make it whole. domesticate the brushed cement and wood marquee, fracture the corridors, soften the lights of observation and renew structural kindness into its gentler shapes.  out of the sea the kelp tangles, out of the south the cities crowd, out of the sky the galaxies emerge in isolation one from another, and the faces here look one to antoher in surprise at what has been made. look at the actual cliffs and canyons of this place, people and programs, mass and energy of fact, look at the possibilities. irradiating all these possibilities.  praise then the arts of law and science as of life the arts of sound and substance as of faith which claim us here to take, as a building, as a fiction, takes us, into another frame of space where we can ponder, celebrate, and reshape not only what we are, where we are from, but what in the risk and moment of our day we may become.

 this song is not a language, not a thing to be remembered, the field-holler tradition of teeth and knees cursing wind, a concert hall of   bloody hands spilling the earth, strangling dirt, sledgehammer curses of  men busted open.  on parchman farm you could hear it coming up through the trees, the hammering pulpit of crooning men and sweat, the tender meat of palms pulped like plums.  them men gulped down the dawn dew air, let it catch in their throats, broke the sunrise up and sang hymns like hexes:  be my woman gal, i’ll beeee your maaaaaaan...  and the killing fields of  mississippi fizzled down to juke joints and the hothouse music of illegal clubs with thick women they loved outright and played cards with and gave bourbon to when their hands didn’t hold sorrow like pickaxes and the railroad was just a railroad, a way to ride north if  you could get your money right.  redbone gals with rosewater sweat, when they lifted their knees sunflower county was a heaven they believed in.  stick to the promise, gal, that you maaaaaade meeeeee...  steady now, they turned back the clock on their hard, hard hands, let the memory of fresh linen and ladies’ slips like gossamer wings, a parade of  plump thighs, the juju thrust of  furious bones spread like grease across starched-white sheets, midwife them out of ol’ parchman farm  and back to the cockfights and gambling, back when they had ambition, back when they had a sweet woman to hold, her fat wrists soft as butter, limp as rain.  when she walk, she reel and rock beeeeeehind ain’t that enough to make a convict smiiiiiiiiile.

 thirteen years ago,    before bulk barns    and fifth gear diesel tractors,    we rode royal blue tractors with toolboxes big enough    to hold a six pack on ice. in the one hundred fifteen degree    summer heat    with air    so thick with moisture you drink as you breathe. before the year dusters sprayed malathion over our clustered bodies,    perspiring while we primed bottom lugs, those ground level leaves of tobacco, and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled eight-inch balls off our arms at night    and cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours. before we were poisoned    and the hospital thought we had been burned in fires, at least to the third degree, when the raw, oozing hives that covered ninety-eight percent of our bodies from the sprays ordered by the fda and spread by     landowners, before anyone had seen automated machines that top and prime. while we topped the lavender blooms of many tiny flowers gathered into one,    gorgeous. by grasping hold below the petals with our bare, calloused hands and twisting downward, quick, hard, only one time,    snapped them off. before edgers and herbicides took what they call weeds, when we walked for days through thirty acres    and chopped them out with hoes. hoes,    made long before    from wood and steel and sometimes (even longer ago) from wood and deer scapula. before the bulk primers came and we primed all the leaves by hand, stooped over at the waist for the lower ones    and    through the season gradually    rising higher     until    we stood and worked simultaneously, as married to the fields as we were to each other, carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh leaves under each arm    and    sewing them onto sticks four feet long on a looper under the shade of a tin-roofed barn,    made of shingle, and poking it up through the rafters inside to be caught by a hanger    who poked it up higher in the rafters    to another who held a higher position and    so    they filled the barn. and the leaves hung down like butterfly wings,    though sometimes the color of luna moths,    or carolina parakeets,    when just an hour ago    they had been laid upon    the old wooden cart trailers pulled behind the orange allis-chalmers tractor with huge, round fenders and only a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox, picked by primers    so hot we would race through the rows to reach the twenty-five gallon jugs of water placed throughout the field to encourage    and    in attempt to satisfy our insatiable thirsts from drinking air    which poured through our pores without breaking through to our need    for more water    in the sun. sun we imagined to disappear yet respected    for growing all things on earth when quenched with rains called forth by our song     and drumming. leaves, which weeks later,    would be taken down and the strings pulled like string on top of a large dog-food bag and sheeted up into burlap sheets that bundled over a hundred pounds when we smashed down with our feet, but gently smashing, then thrown up high    to a catcher    on a big clapboard trailer pulled behind two-ton trucks and taken to market in fuquay-varina and sold to philip morris    and winston-salem    for around    a buck a pound. leaves cured to a bright leaf, a golden yellow with the strongest aroma of tobacco barn curing and hand grown quality before the encroachment of big business in the reagan era and the slow murder of method from a hundred years before. when the loons cried out in laughter by the springs and the bass popped the surface on the pond, early on, next to the fields, before that time when it was unfashionable to transplant each individual baby plant, the infant tobacco we nurtured, to transplant those seedlings to each hill in the field, the space for that particular plant and we watched    as    they would grow. before all of this new age, new way, i was a sharecropper in willow springs, north carolina, as were you    and we were proud to be tsa la gi wishing for winter    so we could make camp at qualla boundary    and oconaluftee would be free of tourists and filled with snow and those of us who held out forever and had no cibs would be home again with our people, while the bia forgot to watch. when we still remembered before even the europeans, working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants of their slaves they brought from africa when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the middle east, that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we prayed whenever we smoked and did not smoke for pleasure    and i    was content and free. then they came and changed things and you left me for a fancy white girl and i waited on the land until you brought her back in that brand new white trans am, purchased from our crop,    you gave her and left her waiting in a motel. the nearest one was forty miles away, but    near enough    for you and    for her    and i knew    though i never spoke a word to you about it,    i knew and i kept it to myself    to this day    and time    and i never let on until i left    on our anniversary. i drove the pick-up down the dirt path    by the empty fields and rented a shack for eighty dollars, the one with cardboard windows and a gillespie house floor design, with torn and faded floral paper on walls and linoleum so thin over rotted board that the floor gave if you weighed over a hundred pounds.    i did not. and with no running water of any kind,    or bathroom. the one at hilltop,    where i could see out across all the fields and hunt for meat when i wanted and find peace. i heard you remarried and went into automated farming and kept up with america. i watched all of you    from the hill and i waited for the lavender blooms to return    and when it was spring even the blooms    had turned white. i rolled up my bedroll,    remembering before, when the fields were like waves on a green ocean, and turned away,    away from the change and corruption    of big business on small farms of traditional agricultural people,    and sharecroppers. away,    so that i could always    hold this concise image of before    that    time    and it floods    my memory.

 we are circling, glad of the battle: we joy in the smell of the smoke. fight on in the hell of the trenches: we publish your names with a croak! ye will lie in dim heaps when the sunset blows cold on the reddening sand; yet fight, for the dead will have wages—a death-clutch of dust in the hand. ye have given us banquet, o kings, and still do we clamor for more: vast, vast is our hunger, as vast as the sea-hunger gnawing the shore.  ’tis well ye are swift with your signals— the blaze of the banners, the blare of the bugles, the boom of battalions, the cannon-breath hot on the air. it is for our hunger ye hurry, it is for our feast ye are met: be sure we will never forget you, o servants that never forget! for we are the spirits of battle, the peerage of greed we defend: our lineage rose from the night, and we go without fellow or friend.  we were ere our servant sesostris spread over the asian lands the smoke of the blood of the peoples, and scattered their bones to the sands. we circled in revel for ages above the assyrian stream, while babylon builded her beauty, and faded to dust and to dream. we scattered our laughter on nations— and troy was a word and a waste, the glory of carthage was ruined, the grandeur of rome was effaced!  and we blazoned the name of timour, as he harried his herd of kings, and the host of his hordes wound on, a dragon with undulant rings. and we slid down the wind upon france, when the steps of the earthquake passed, when the bastile bloomed into flame, and the heavens went by on the blast. we hung over austerlitz, cheering the armies with jubilant cries: we scented three kings at the carnage, and croaked our applause from the skies.  o kings, ye have catered to vultures— have chosen to feed us, forsooth, the joy of the world and her glory, the hope of the world and her youth. o kings, ye are diligent lackeys: we laurel your names with our praise, for ye are the staff of our comfort, for ye are the strength of our days. then spur on the host in the trenches to give up the sky at a stroke: we tell all the winds of their glory: we publish their fame with a croak!

 who is the happy warrior? who is he that every man in arms should wish to be? —it is the generous spirit, who, when brought among the tasks of real life, hath wrought upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought: whose high endeavours are an inward light that makes the path before him always bright; who, with a natural instinct to discern what knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn; abides by this resolve, and stops not there, but makes his moral being his prime care; who, doomed to go in company with pain, and fear, and bloodshed, miserable train! turns his necessity to glorious gain; in face of these doth exercise a power which is our human nature's highest dower: controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves of their bad influence, and their good receives: by objects, which might force the soul to abate her feeling, rendered more compassionate; is placable—because occasions rise so often that demand such sacrifice; more skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure, as tempted more; more able to endure, as more exposed to suffering and distress; thence, also, more alive to tenderness. —'tis he whose law is reason; who depends upon that law as on the best of friends; whence, in a state where men are tempted still to evil for a guard against worse ill, and what in quality or act is best doth seldom on a right foundation rest, he labours good on good to fix, and owes to virtue every triumph that he knows: —who, if he rise to station of command, rises by open means; and there will stand on honourable terms, or else retire, and in himself possess his own desire; who comprehends his trust, and to the same keeps faithful with a singleness of aim; and therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait for wealth, or honours, or for worldly state; whom they must follow; on whose head must fall, like showers of manna, if they come at all: whose powers shed round him in the common strife, or mild concerns of ordinary life, a constant influence, a peculiar grace; but who, if he be called upon to face some awful moment to which heaven has joined great issues, good or bad for human kind, is happy as a lover; and attired with sudden brightness, like a man inspired; and, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law in calmness made, and sees what he foresaw; or if an unexpected call succeed, come when it will, is equal to the need: —he who, though thus endued as with a sense and faculty for storm and turbulence, is yet a soul whose master-bias leans to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes; sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be, are at his heart; and such fidelity it is his darling passion to approve; more brave for this, that he hath much to love:— 'tis, finally, the man, who, lifted high, conspicuous object in a nation's eye, or left unthought-of in obscurity,— who, with a toward or untoward lot, prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not— plays, in the many games of life, that one where what he most doth value must be won: whom neither shape or danger can dismay, nor thought of tender happiness betray; who, not content that former worth stand fast, looks forward, persevering to the last, from well to better, daily self-surpast: who, whether praise of him must walk the earth for ever, and to noble deeds give birth, or he must fall, to sleep without his fame, and leave a dead unprofitable name— finds comfort in himself and in his cause; and, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws his breath in confidence of heaven's applause: this is the happy warrior; this is he that every man in arms should wish to be.

 between the bridge and the river he falls through a huge portion of night; it is not as if falling  is something new. over and over he slipped into the gulf between what he knew and how he was known. what others wanted  opened like an abyss: the laughing stock-clerks at the grocery, women at the luncheonette amused by his gestures. what could he do, live  with one hand tied behind his back? so he began to fall into the star-faced section of night between the trestle  and the water because he could not meet a little town’s demands, and his earrings shone and his wrists were as limp as they were.  i imagine he took the insults in and made of them a place to live; we learn to use the names because they are there,  familiar furniture:faggot was the bed he slept in, hard and white, but simple somehow, queer something sharp  but finally useful, a tool, all the jokes a chair, stiff-backed to keep the spine straight, a table, a lamp. and because  he’s fallen for twenty-three years, despite whatever awkwardness his flailing arms and legs assume he is beautiful  and like any good diver has only an edge of fear he transforms into grace. or else he is not afraid,  and in this way climbs back up the ladder of his fall, out of the river into the arms of the three teenage boys  who hurled him from the edge— really boys now, afraid, their fathers’ cars shivering behind them, headlights on—and tells them  it’s all right, that he knows they didn’t believe him when he said he couldn’t swim, and blesses his killers  in the way that only the dead can afford to forgive.

 when i am a toddler, a child, a tween, a teen, and a young adult, i am called an ancestral soul, a ti gran moun, a little old person.  adults study me and decide that i am wise beyond my years, mature for my age, emotionally ripe. i am told it is unusual to meet a five-ten-fifteen-year-old girl who does not slouch or mumble or speak in monosyllables.  when i do the things that come naturally to me—when i hold my spine up erect, when i wait my turn to speak, when i speak having listened, carefully, when i enunciate, when i look grown-ups in the eye—i am told i must have “been here before.”  "how do you know?" one college professor asks me after she has seen a psychologically violent play i have written at age nineteen. "how do you already know?”  in high school, i charm my teachers. they encourage me to write speeches about feminism that i recite for international women's day at city hall or deliver as part of conference panels at local universities. “if you were older," they tell me, "we would probably be friends.” one of them even flirts with me.  among my peers i exist somewhere between amicably mysterious and irrevocably dorky. the popular kids greet me in the hallways, but they never invite me to their beer-drenched parties. i will never play spin the bottle. i will never play seven minutes in heaven. my mother tells me she is protecting me from boys, but the truth is, after i do my homework, she wants me to type up another family friend’s résumé or resignation letter. at home, i am a bridge, a cultural interpreter, a spokesperson, a trusted ally, an american who is haitian too, but also definitely american.  the children of immigrants don't get to be children. we lose our innocence watching our parents' backs bend, break. i am an old soul because when i am young, i watch my parents' spirits get slaughtered.  in haiti, they were middle class. hopeful teachers. home owners. they were black like their live-in servants. they donated clothes to the poor. they gave up everything they knew to inherit american dreams. and here, they join factory lines, wipe shit from mean old white men's behinds, scrub five-star hotel toilets for dimes above minimum wage. here, they shuck and jive and step and fetch and play chauffeur to people who aren't as smart as they are, people who do not speak as many languages as they do. in the 1980s, they are barred from giving blood because newscasters and politicians say that aids comes from where they come from: haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere, a black magic island that spawns boat people and chaos, a place of illiterate zombies, orphan beggars and brazen political corruption.  when i am a child, my childhood is a luxury my family cannot afford. their dignity is not spared, so my innocence is not spared. they are humiliated and traumatized daily, so i become a nurse to their trauma. i am told too much, so i know too much, so i am wise beyond my years.  when i am six, my mother tells me that when she found out she was pregnant with me at age nineteen, she “tried to kill the baby." she says "the baby," as if it isn’t me she’s talking about; as if i am not the expensive, scandalous daughter who forced my way into her world despite the abortion-inducing herbal teas she drank and her frantic leaps off of small buildings.  when i am sixteen, my father calls me on the phone to, inevitably, weep. he says, "living in this country, i have learned not to hope for things. only you are my hope. only you."  so—yes, i grow up fast.

 1914-18  ("the honours of war" —a diversity of creatures) these were our children who died for our lands: they were dear in our sight. we have only the memory left of their home-treasured sayings and laughter. the price of our loss shall be paid to our hands, not another’s hereafter. neither the alien nor priest shall decide on it.    that is our right. but who shall return us the children?  at the hour the barbarian chose to disclose his pretences, and raged against man, they engaged, on the breasts that they bared for us, the first felon-stroke of the sword he had long-time prepared for us— their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences.  they bought us anew with their blood, forbearing to blame us, those hours which we had not made good when the judgment o’ercame us. they believed us and perished for it.    our statecraft, our learning delivered them bound to the pit and alive to the burning whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour— nor since her birth has our earth seen such worth loosed upon her.  nor was their agony brief, or once only imposed on them. the wounded, the war-spent, the sick received no exemption: being cured they returned and endured and achieved our redemption, hopeless themselves of relief, till death, marveling, closed on them.  that flesh we had nursed from the first in all cleanness was given to corruption unveiled and assailed by the malice of heaven— by the heart-shaking jests of decay where it lolled in the wires— to be blanched or gay-painted by fumes— to be cindered by fires— to be senselessly tossed and retossed in stale mutilation from crater to crater.    for that we shall take expiation. but who shall return us our children?

 my mother in her dress of red viyella, teetering like a tiny idol on three-inch lacquered spikes, chignon dressed with little gold- throated bells that chirped more sweetly than the cricket, held her small, perfect hands to the torrent pouring from the slots. money went like water through our fingers: was dammed by budgets, released, then abruptly gone at the china starr, that grotto, festooned with red and vivid lanterns. dark as the inside of a limousine, that saloon was where our lives, dulled by the copper barons, were cleansed, where we bade good-bye to the limp and stutter of bad goods, to the wince of the creaky rocker, to the vast grandmother dying in its clutch, to the dirty, wrinkled ones and tens pieced together to cover the week. hello, we said, to the beautiful dark starlit bar and the luxury therein: the runcible spoons with their slippery cargo: the snarled silk of tinned bean sprout, the wrinkled flame of the dried lily. hunched over our beakers of jasmine tea, we let the exotic rinse over us—impractical and non-negotiable.

 oh, dear! the christian virtues will disappear! nowhere on land or sea will be room for charity! nowhere, in field or city, a person to help or pity! better for them, no doubt, not to need helping out of their old miry ditch. but, alas for us, the rich! for we shall lose, you see, our boasted charity!— lose all the pride and joy of giving the poor employ, and money, and food, and love (and making stock thereof!). our christian virtues are gone, with nothing to practise on!  it don’t hurt them a bit, for they can’t practise it; but it’s our great joy and pride— what virtue have we beside? we believe, as sure as we live, that it is more blessed to give than to want, and waste, and grieve, and occasionally receive! and here are the people pressing to rob us of our pet blessing! no chance to endow or bedizen a hospital, school or prison, and leave our own proud name to gratitude and fame! no chance to do one good deed, to give what we do not need, to leave what we cannot use to those whom we deign to choose! when none want broken meat, how shall our cake be sweet? when none want flannels and coals, how shall we save our souls? oh, dear! oh, dear! the christian virtues will disappear!  the poor have their virtues rude,— meekness and gratitude, endurance, and respect for us, the world’s elect; economy, self-denial, patience in every trial, self-sacrifice, self-restraint,— virtues enough for a saint! virtues enough to bear all this life’s sorrow and care! virtues by which to rise to a front seat in the skies! how can they turn from this to common earthly bliss,— mere clothes, and food, and drink, and leisure to read and think, and art, and beauty, and ease,— there is no crown for these! true, if their gratitude were not for fire and food, they might still learn to bless the lord for their happiness! and, instead of respect for wealth, might learn from beauty, and health, and freedom in power and pelf, each man to respect himself! and, instead of scraping and saving, might learn from using and having that man’s life should be spent in a grand development! but this is petty and small; these are not virtues at all; they do not look as they should; they don’t do us any good! oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear! the christian virtues will disappear!

 her sickness brought me to connecticut. mornings i walk the dog: that part of life is intact. who's painted, who's insulated or put siding on, who's burned the lawn with lime—that's the news on ardmore street.  the leaves of the neighbor's respectable rhododendrons curl under in the cold. he has backed the car through the white nimbus of its exhaust and disappeared for the day.  in the hiatus between mayors the city has left leaves in the gutters, and passing cars lift them in maelstroms.  we pass the house two doors down, the one with the wildest lights in the neighborhood, an establishment without irony. all summer their putto empties a water jar, their st. francis feeds the birds. now it's angels, festoons, waist-high candles, and swans pulling sleighs.  two hundred miles north i'd let the dog run among birches and the black shade of pines. i miss the hills, the woods and stony streams, where the swish of jacket sleeves against my sides seems loud, and a crow caws sleepily at dawn.  by now the streams must run under a skin of ice, white air-bubbles passing erratically, like blood cells through a vein. soon the mail, forwarded, will begin to reach me here.

 corpses push up through thawing permafrost  as i scrape salmon skin off a pan at the sink; on the porch, motes in slanting yellow light  undulate in air. is venus at dusk as luminous as venus at dawn? yesterday i was about to  seal a borax capsule angled up from the bottom  of a decaying exterior jamb when i glimpsed jagged ice floating in a bay. naval sonar  slices through whales, even as a portion of male dorsal fin is served to the captain  of an umiak. stopped in traffic, he swings from  a chairlift, gazes down at scarlet paintbrush. moistening an envelope before sealing it,  i recall the slight noise you made when i grazed your shoulder. when a frost wiped out  the chalk blue flowering plant by the door,  i watered until it revived from the roots. the song of a knife sharpener in an alley  passes through the mind of a microbiologist before he undergoes anesthesia for surgery.  the first night of autumn has singed  bell peppers by the fence, while budding chamisa stalks in the courtyard bend to ground.  observing people conversing at a nearby table, he visualizes the momentary convergence  and divergence of lines passing through a point.  the wisteria along the porch never blooms; a praying mantis on the wood floor sips water  from a dog bowl. laughter from upstairs echoes downstairs as teenage girls compare bra sizes.  an ex-army officer turned critic frets  over the composition of a search committee, snickers and disparages rival candidates.  a welder, who turns away for a few seconds to gaze at the sangre de cristos, detects a line  of trucks backed up on an international overpass  where exhaust spews onto houses below. the day may be called one toothroad or six thunderpain,  but the naming of a day will not transform it, nor will the mathematics of time halt.  an imprint of ginkgo leaf—fan-shaped, slightly  thickened, slightly wavy on broad edge, two- lobed, with forking parallel veins but no  midvein—in a slab of coal is momentary beauty, while ginkgoes along a street dropping gold  leaves are mindless beauty of the quotidian.  once thought extinct, the ginkgo was discovered in himalayan monasteries  and propagated back into the world. although i cannot save a grasshopper singed by frost  trying to warm itself on a sunlit walkway,  i ponder shadows of budding pink and orange bougainvilleas on a wall. as masons level sand,  lay bricks in horizontal then vertical pairs, we construct a ground to render a space  our own. as light from a partial lunar eclipse  diffuses down skylight walls, we rock and sluice, rock and sluice, fingertips fanned  to fanned fingertips, debouch into plenitude. venus vanishes in a brightening sky:  the diamond ring of a solar eclipse persists.  you did not have to fly to zimbabwe in june 2001 to experience it. the day recalls thirteen death  and one deer when an end slips into a beginning. i recall mating butterflies with red dots on wings,  the bow of a long liner thudding on waves,  crescendo of water beginning to boil in a kettle, echoes of humpback whales. in silence, dancers  concentrate on movements onstage; lilacs bud by a gate. as bits of consciousness constellate,  i rouse to a 3 a.m. december rain on the skylight.  a woman sweeps glass shards in a driveway, oblivious to elm branches reflected on windshields  of passing cars. juniper crackles in the fireplace; flukes break the water as a whale dives.  the path of totality is not marked by  a shadow hurtling across the earth’s surface at three thousand kilometers per hour.  our eyelashes attune to each other. at the mouth of an arroyo, a lamb skull  and ribcage bleach in the sand; tufts  of fleece caught on barbed wire vanish. the shang carved characters in the skulls  of their enemies, but what transpired here? you do not need to steep turtle shells  in blood to prognosticate clouds. someone  dumps a refrigerator upstream in the riverbed while you admire the yellow blossoms of  a golden rain tree. a woman weeds, sniffs fragrance from a line of onions in her garden;  you scramble an egg, sip oolong tea.  the continuous bifurcates into the segmented as the broken extends. someone steals  a newspaper while we doze. a tiger swallowtail lands on a patio columbine;  a single agaric breaks soil by a hollyhock.  pushing aside branches of russian olives to approach the pojoaque river, we spot  a splatter of flicker feathers in the dirt. here chance and fate enmesh.  here i hold a black bowl rinsed with tea,  savor the warmth at my fingertips, aroma of emptiness. we rock back and forth,  back and forth on water. fins of spinner dolphins break the waves; a whale spouts  to the north-northwest. what is not impelled?  yellow hibiscus, zodiac, hairbrush; barbed wire, smog, snowflake—when i still  my eyes, the moments dilate. rain darkens gravel in the courtyard; shriveled apples  on branches are weightless against dawn.

 i mean, who isn’t heating up for the next life on the order of antoine doinel, or a pot of unsweetened chocolate. beginning with a single window and the sense that what we know outgrows everything except a headache or the desk dreaming on its own. it doesn’t matter if being upright brings living beings closer to the lives they lead (one’s 26-year-old self smokes a cigar but isn’t a desperado) nor is beginning a poem with someone’s wrath a means of stepping outside the self as though volume equalled flesh tones — any more than the epic of the roast chicken with lyonnaise potatoes and greens takes over the above-ground, colors and smells aside.

 / you are in the dark, in the car, watching the black-tarred street being swallowed by speed; he tells you his dean is making him hire a person of color when there are so many great writers out there. you think maybe this is an experiment and you are being tested or retroactively insulted or you have done something that communicates this is an okay conversation to be having. why do you feel okay saying this to me? you wish the light would turn red or a police siren would go off so you could slam on the brakes, slam into the car ahead of you, be propelled forward so quickly both your faces would suddenly be exposed to the wind. as usual you drive straight through the moment with the expected backing off of what was previously said. it is not only that confrontation is headache producing; it is also that you have a destination that doesn’t include acting like this moment isn’t inhabitable, hasn’t happened before, and the before isn’t part of the now as the night darkens  and the time shortens between where we are and where we are going. / when you arrive in your driveway and turn off the car, you remain behind the wheel another ten minutes. you fear the night is being locked in and coded on a cellular level and want time to function as a power wash. sitting there staring at the closed garage door you are reminded that a friend once told you there exists a medical term — john henryism — for people exposed to stresses stemming from racism. they achieve themselves to death trying to dodge the build up of erasure. sherman james, the researcher who came up with the term, claimed the physiological costs were high. you hope by sitting in  silence you are bucking the trend. / when the stranger asks, why do you care? you just stand there staring at him. he has just referred to the boisterous teenagers in starbucks as niggers. hey, i am standing right here, you responded, not necessarily expecting him to turn to you. he is holding the lidded paper cup in one hand and a small paper bag in the other. they are just being kids. come on, no need to get all kkk on them, you say. now there you go, he responds. the people around you have turned away from their screens. the teenagers are on pause. there i go? you ask, feeling irritation begin to rain down. yes, and something about hearing yourself repeating this stranger’s accusation in a voice usually reserved for your partner makes you smile. / a man knocked over her son in the subway. you feel your own body wince. he’s okay, but the son of a bitch kept walking. she says she grabbed the stranger’s arm and told him to apologize: i told him to look at the boy and apologize. and yes, you want it to stop, you want the black child pushed to the ground to be seen, to be helped to his feet and be brushed off, not brushed off  by the person that did not see him, has never seen him, has perhaps never seen anyone who is not a reflection of himself. the beautiful thing is that a group of men began to stand behind me like a fleet of  bodyguards, she says, like newly found uncles and brothers. / the new therapist specializes in trauma counseling. you have only ever spoken on the phone. her house has a side gate that leads to a back entrance she uses for patients. you walk down a path bordered on both sides with deer grass and rosemary to the gate, which turns out to be locked. at the front door the bell is a small round disc that you press firmly. when the door finally opens, the woman standing there yells, at the top of her lungs, get away from my house. what are you doing in my yard? it’s as if a wounded doberman pinscher or a german shepherd has gained the power of speech. and though you back up a few steps, you manage to tell her you have an appointment. you have an appointment? she spits back. then she pauses. everything pauses. oh, she says, followed by, oh, yes, that’s right. i am sorry. i am so sorry, so, so sorry.  /

 it is windy today. a wall of wind crashes against, windows clunk against, iron frames as wind swings past broken glass and seethes, like a frightened cat in empty spaces of the cellblock.  in the exercise yard we sat huddled in our prison jackets, on our haunches against the fence, and the wind carried our words over the fences, while the vigilant guard on the tower held his cap at the sudden gust.  i could see the main tower from where i sat, and the wind in my face gave me the feeling i could grasp the tower like a cornstalk, and snap it from its roots of rock.  the wind plays it like a flute, this hollow shoot of rock. the brim girded with barbwire with a guard sitting there also, listening intently to the sounds as clouds cover the sun.  i thought of the day i was coming to prison, in the back seat of a police car, hands and ankles chained, the policeman pointed, “see that big water tank? the big silver one out there, sticking up? that’s the prison.”  and here i am, i cannot believe it. sometimes it is such a dream, a dream, where i stand up in the face of the wind, like now, it blows at my jacket, and my eyelids flick a little bit, while i stare disbelieving. . . .  the third day of spring, and four years later, i can tell you, how a man can endure, how a man can become so cruel, how he can die or become so cold. i can tell you this, i have seen it every day, every day, and still i am strong enough to love you, love myself and feel good; even as the earth shakes and trembles, and i have not a thing to my name, i feel as if i have everything, everything.

 chile, 1834  a month before his dinner with the visiting spanish lawyer, he had “set out for the purpose of geologizing,” and rode back over the ridge of the chilecauquen with a huge jute bag of living shells from the sandy flats at the coast, and with another, as full, of dead barnacles scraped from the rock. a few months forward from that dinner —on the island of san pedro, where the beagle was anchored awaiting him—he would be sneaking up on a fox “of a kind very rare” and donking it stoutly “on the head with my geological hammer.” (the fox, he’ll write, “is now in the zoological society.”) so what does he think, when the spanish lawyer expresses a disbelief that the king of england would be so loco as to bother to ship to this sensible, orderly country a man “to pick up beetles and lizards, and to break stones”? no, the whiff of something “off ”—like suspect meat—attends eccentric stunts like these. “i do not like it: if one of us were to go and do such things in england, do not you think the king of england would very shortly command us to leave his shores?” renous, another student of bugs and rocks, from germany, is also there at dinner, and he mentions then that once, in a house in san fernando, he’d been discovered contemplating the transformation of caterpillars to butterflies. he couldn’t deny it: there they were, the writhing green proof, in an open box! “the padres and the governor consulted, and agreed it must be some heresy”—and so renous was arrested. darwin can only shake his head in a quiet bemusement as his guests converse. those inchling creatures crawling over their chopped-up foliage, heads as blunt as thimbled thumbs . . .heretical? how could anybody believe that the innocent jumble in the baskets and flasks of a naturalist is dangerous?  *  and lillian colton—the woman in owatonna, minnesota who for forty years has avidly collected the seeds of that state and, with them (“poking them into place with toothpicks and gluing them down”), has portraitured “american presidents, movie stars, country musicians, rock and roll legends, scientific and religious leaders (including mother teresa)” —what suspiciousness might seize the spanish lawyer if he saw her on her rounds? what edgy wariness would grip him if he chanced on nellie staves, “at 87 perhaps the most famous adirondack trapper,” out in the summer to harvest shell-shaped fungus off the dead trees of those shaded, spinous hills? —she’ll work for twenty hours straight on one, with the point of an old school compass, stippling it into the scene of a great alert-eyed ram or a sunrise, watching as the fungus’s own interior, brown juices dye the image into permanence. who would these represent, for the spanish lawyer, what forbidden other?—a girl in the corner, walling her attention away from her sisters’ strident hip-hop, by reading a fanciful tale of witches? a girl on a dancer pole at sturgis, strobing her tits for the boys in a quick 1-2-1 semaphore of fuck-the-work-week revelry? surely not. surely these are no threat to his world. and yet for nothing more than positing a newly ordered sky map, giordano bruno was led in chains from his cell in the roman prison of castel san’angelo, there where he’d spent eight years as the inquisition hammered at his ideas and his calm resolve. it was february 19th, 1600; he was tied to an iron stake; a wedge was stuffed in his mouth, to prevent any final utterance of blasphemy; and he was burned alive. the leg skin bubbled off of his body like a christmas pig’s. it turns out that a redone sky implies a redone god—and a god is intolerant of this, a god is jealous of any counter claim to the pedigree of his cosmos. yes, but . . . surely not this mushroom picker? not this boy who simply speaks to invisible friends as he wanders around the alleys? oh but that would depend on the given spanish lawyer of that given day and circumstance. in ghent, a cock was put on trial and sentenced to death for repeatedly disturbing the peace of the lord’s day, sunday. it had been warned; so now it was just, to lead this beast to a chopping block —restoring the sanctified order.  *  kansas, 2004  ah, for a witty transition from “cock” to my neighbors suzette and edie!—lesbians, now in love with each other for over a decade and wanting only to declare their love in a marriage vow, “like anyone,” as edie says. not that my schoolboy humor would find favor in their reading life . . . although we get along; some shared affinity enables the church of the gay girls and the orthodox congregation of guy to coexist with an amiability. still, i’ve witnessed other people pass them by with the slitted, ophidian stare of xenophobia. suzette and edie —are they the new apostasy? are they our own anne hutchinson? in 1638 she was found guilty, after a two-day trial, of heresy—of being “a woman not fitt for our society.” with will, she had embraced doctrinal misinterpretations, “some of them blasphemus, others erroneus and all unsafe, and of the devill of hell,” and she was excommunicated from massachusetts bay colony “evermore.” her actual crime?—a claim “the holy spirit illumines the heart of every true believer” without the need of a minister intervening. for this, she was harried into the wilds —it was called a “hiving-out”—and set at the mercy of wolf and of winter, “and it were death to return.” her other actual crime?—that after a pregnancy, she had been delivered “of thirtie monstrus births or therabowts at once, some of them bigger, some lessr, some of one shape, some of an other, few of any perfect shape, none at all of them of human shape”—which perhaps is what you’d expect from a woman of “nimble witt and active spirit and verie voluble tonggue.” at the republican convention, it was, indeed, the voluble tongue that edie always flapped so saucily (and too, i’d guess, her rainbow-hue we’re already bedded . . . why not wedded? t-shirt) that (on her side) led inevitably to the violence. a surly officer suggested that she move. she pointed out how she was already in the caged-off square allowed for free-speech protest, and had no intention of leaving. there were “gestures they exchanged”. . . and then a stun gun’s 50,000 volts were suddenly alive inside her, just enough to crumple her into helplessness so that, when the panic began, she was trampled by friends and police alike. a lung was crushed, and when i visited three weeks later, her skin was still a nightmare turkish rug of bruise. (for a moment, i saw in the air around her the first disabling gust of snow in the woods at the border of massachusetts bay in 1638.) to be fair, i should add that the confrontational officer doing crowd control went home with his head little more than a pocket of blood and neural damage. do not, i warn you, ever lightly cross a wiccan bowler.  *  terms i haven’t yet used, from my pile of notes: separatist, sedition, dogma. finally, though, when those clouds of abstraction open up, it’s always one specific ordinary rainy day, in chicago, in 1961. i’m thirteen, squeaky-voiced, and with an adam’s apple popping from my thin throat like a doorknob—while my father is large, he fought the neighbor’s crazy german shepherd to a standstill once, and behind him are generations of him, solemn and knowing. we’re standing there in front of the house, in a dim autumnal downpour, and it wouldn’t look to anyone else like an even match, my scrawny shouts, his thousands of years of righteousness; and yet, in emotional terms, i have the upper hand. i won’t believe in his god. i won’t believe in any god, in any synagogue, in any mumbo jumbo or rabbinical teetotum, and i’m screaming this and screaming this and screaming this, until i see the rain become his face, and for the only time except his mother’s funeral on a similar day of wet and chill in a shivering mix, my father cries in front of me. and god, if he’s there, must write my name down on a list that he’ll turn over to his deputies on earth —his spanish lawyers. there are many terms for this, but only one rain. now it’s falling, grayish twill, on a hill along the coast of the chonos archipelago islands. 1835. a mound of seals in the distance, “huddled together, asleep: they appeared to be of a loving disposition; but even pigs would be ashamed of their dirt,” which is picked at by the turkey-buzzards. terns, gulls, black-necked swans. a deposit of sandstone. “four great snowy cones” of the local volcanoes. he couldn’t be happier. he has computed the number of eggs in a tenth-of-an-inch of a sea-slug’s potent slime, he has suggested how “a great volume might be written, describing one of these beds of sea-weed.” the otter. the spunky chilean mouse. he has read “a most interesting discussion on the history of the common potato.” he couldn’t be more mesmerized in the grand salons of paris than here, in the rain, with his sodden insect net. and who would complain? he isn’t any rooster. he isn’t going to rudely wake anyone from a long sound sleep.

 earth has not anything to show more fair: dull would he be of soul who could pass by a sight so touching in its majesty: this city now doth, like a garment, wear the beauty of the morning; silent, bare, ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie open unto the fields, and to the sky; all bright and glittering in the smokeless air. never did sun more beautifully steep in his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill; ne'er saw i, never felt, a calm so deep! the river glideth at his own sweet will: dear god! the very houses seem asleep; and all that mighty heart is lying still!

 for my father vivid and heavy, he strolls through dark brick kitchens within the great house of esterhazy: a deaf servant’s candle is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about the green kindling! the wassail is being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles  over thirty baked apples in a large bowl: into the wassail, young girls empty their aprons of cinnamon, ground mace, and allspice berries. a cook adds egg whites and brandy. the giant glass snifters on a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids. the anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig  stuffed with devonshire cream. in the sinks the gallbladders of geese are soaking in cold salted water. walking in the storm, this evening, he passed children in rags, singing carols; they were roped together in the drifting snow outside the palace gate. he knew he would remember those boys’ faces. . .  there’s a procession into the kitchens: larger boys, each with a heavy shoe of coal. the pianist sits and looks hard at a long black sausage. he will not eat  before playing the new sonata. beside him the table sags with hams, kidney pies, and two shoulders of lamb.a hand rings a bell in the parlor!  no longer able to hide, he walks straight into the large room that blinds him with light. he sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries. . . the simple sonata which  he is playing has little to do with what he’s feeling: something larger where a viola builds, in air, an infinite staircase. an oboe joins the viola, they struggle for a more florid harmony. but the silent violins now emerge  and, like the big wing of a bird, smother everything in a darkness from which only a single horn escapes— that feels effaced by the composer’s dream. . . but he is not dreaming, the composer is finishing two performances simultaneously!  he is back in the dark kitchens, sulking and counting his few florins—they have paid him with a snuffbox that was pressed with two diamonds, in holland! this century discovers quinine. and the sketchbooks of a mad, sad musician  who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside a critic. he screamed:here, take the snuffbox, i’ve filled it with the dander of dragons!

 perhaps i’m a cruel artist. i always depict in great details, lovingly, all the defects on the faces and bodies of my models. i use my eyes and brushes to thread the jagged gaps of their stiff smiles. i pamper each pimple, hump, massage each incrustation.  i cajole my models into poses that are awkward, dangerous, unhygienic, sometimes mortifying. i don’t care to paint smooth, poreless skin but collect all manners of rashes and eruptions. inspired, i’ve forced a hundred bodies—impossibly old, extremely young—onto appalling heaps,  democratically naked, viscous with sweat, spit and etc., just so i could render the human condition most accurately and movingly.

 o ur p atron of f alling s hort , w ho b ecame a p rayer   i used to sneak into the movies without paying. i watched the stories but i failed to see the dark. i went to college and drank everything they gave me, and i never paid for any of that water on which i drifted as if by grace until after the drownings, when in the diamond light of seven-something a.m., as the spring was tearing me up in cartajena, only praying on my knees before the magnifying ark of the seventh st. hotel could possibly save me, until falling on my face before the daughter of money while the world poured from the till brought the moment’s length against the moment’s height, and paying was what i was earning and eating and wearing.

 i. of choice  despair is big with friends i love, hydrogen and burning jews. i give them all the grief i have but i tell them, friends, i choose, i choose,  don’t make me say against my glands or how the world has treated me. though gay and modest give offense and people grieve pretentiously,  more than i hoped to do, i do and more than i deserve i get; what little i attend, i know and it argues order more than not.  my desperate friends, i want to tell them, you take too delicate offense at the stench of time and man’s own smell, it is only the smell of consequence.  ii. of love  people love each other and the light of love gilds but doesn’t alter, people don’t change one another, can scarcely by taking will and thought add a little now and then to their own statures which, praise them, they do, so that here we are in all our sizes flooded in the impartial daylight sometimes, spotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves, human, the beams of attention of social animals at their work which is loving; and sometimes all dark.  the only correction is by you of you, by me of me. people are worth looking at in this light and if you listen what they are saying is, love me sun out there whoever you are, chasing me from bed in the morning, spooking me all day with shadow, surprising me whenever you fall; make me conspicuous as i go here, spotted by however many beams, now light, finally dark. i fear there is meant to be a lot of darkness,

 for elizabeth bishop you said to me that day, “there’s nothing you can do,” and spoke of auden’s line: “poetry makes nothing happen.” and though i honor you, especially your poems, the objects you dipped in light, then, left in the rainbow, let slip from our sight, i admitted, diving out of self, a sweet woman’s white caress, the hundreds of lives and places in books, failed to counter confusion.  you did agree that it was socrates who said to his athenian friends that governments are only governments with many heads and cannot think as one. that history continues to show how they swing from war to peace and back again, in one wide gallow-sweep just as the pendulum of the world’s clocks returned its towns to craters.  now i must ask myself, fifteen cobalt-blue years later, if the dust of each new war that settles in our bones, and deadens a generation, is no more than negatives of the kennedys, king, and lennon, has less weight than what we felt the day the apollo spaceship landed on the moon, and auden’s line is true, then why did you to the end, live with the dark, sing into your ruin?  
NEW POEM
 “man wants but little here below” little i ask; my wants are few; i only wish a hut of stone, (a very plain brown stone will do,) that i may call my own;— and close at hand is such a one, in yonder street that fronts the sun.  plain food is quite enough for me; three courses are as good as ten;— if nature can subsist on three, thank heaven for three. amen! i always thought cold victual nice;— my choice would be vanilla-ice.  i care not much for gold or land;— give me a mortgage here and there,— some good bank-stock, some note of hand, or trifling railroad share,— i only ask that fortune send a little more than i shall spend.  honors are silly toys, i know, and titles are but empty names; i would,perhaps, be plenipo,— but only near st. james; i’m very sure i should not care to fill our gubernator’s chair.  jewels are baubles; ’t is a sin to care for such unfruitful things;— one good-sized diamond in a pin,— some,not so large, in rings,— a ruby, and a pearl, or so, will do for me;—i laugh at show.  my dame should dress in cheap attire; (good, heavy silks are never dear;)— i own perhaps i might desire some shawls of true cashmere,— some marrowy crapes of china silk, like wrinkled skins on scalded milk.  i would not have the horse i drive so fast that folks must stop and stare; an easy gait—two forty-five— suits me; i do not care;— perhaps, for just a single spurt, some seconds less would do no hurt.  of pictures, i should like to own titians and raphaels three or four,— i love so much their style and tone, one turner, and no more, (a landscape,—foreground golden dirt,— the sunshine painted with a squirt.)  of books but few,—some fifty score for daily use, and bound for wear; the rest upon an upper floor;— some little luxury there of red morocco’s gilded gleam and vellum rich as country cream.  busts, cameos, gems,—such things as these, which others often show for pride, i value for their power to please, and selfish churls deride;— one stradivarius, i confess, two meerschaums, i would fain possess.  wealth’s wasteful tricks i will not learn, nor ape the glittering upstart fool;— shall not carved tables serve my turn, but all must be of buhl? give grasping pomp its double share,— i ask but one recumbent chair.  thus humble let me live and die, nor long for midas’ golden touch; if heaven more generous gifts deny, i shall not miss them much,— too grateful for the blessing lent of simple tastes and mind content!

 for fred i could pick anything and think of you— this lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue my pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page. i could choose any hero, any cause or age and, sure as shooting arrows to the heart, astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart as standing in silver stirrups will allow— there you'll be, with furrowed brow and chain mail glinting, to set me free: one eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.  this post-postmodern age is all business: compact disks and faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks event. today a hurricane is nudging up the coast, oddly male: big bad floyd, who brings a host of daydreams: awkward reminiscences of teenage crushes on worthless boys whose only talent was to kiss you senseless. they all had sissy names—marcel, percy, dewey; were thin as licorice and as chewy, sweet with a dark and hollow center. floyd's  cussing up a storm. you're bunkered in your aerie, i'm perched in mine (twin desks, computers, hardwood floors): we're content, but fall short of the divine. still, it's embarrassing, this happiness— who's satisfied simply with what's good for us, when has the ordinary ever been news? and yet, because nothing else will do to keep me from melancholy (call it blues), i fill this stolen time with you.

 "pheu pheu, ti prosderkesthe m ommasin, tekna;" [[alas, alas, why do you gaze at me with your eyes, my children.]]—medea. do ye hear the children weeping, o my brothers, ere the sorrow comes with years ? they are leaning their young heads against their mothers, — and that cannot stop their tears. the young lambs are bleating in the meadows ; the young birds are chirping in the nest ; the young fawns are playing with the shadows ; the young flowers are blowing toward the west— but the young, young children, o my brothers, they are weeping bitterly ! they are weeping in the playtime of the others, in the country of the free.  do you question the young children in the sorrow, why their tears are falling so ? the old man may weep for his to-morrow which is lost in long ago — the old tree is leafless in the forest — the old year is ending in the frost — the old wound, if stricken, is the sorest — the old hope is hardest to be lost : but the young, young children, o my brothers, do you ask them why they stand weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers, in our happy fatherland ?  they look up with their pale and sunken faces, and their looks are sad to see, for the man's grief abhorrent, draws and presses down the cheeks of infancy — "your old earth," they say, "is very dreary;" "our young feet," they say, "are very weak !" few paces have we taken, yet are weary— our grave-rest is very far to seek ! ask the old why they weep, and not the children, for the outside earth is cold — and we young ones stand without, in our bewildering, and the graves are for the old !"  "true," say the children, "it may happen that we die before our time ! little alice died last year her grave is shapen like a snowball, in the rime. we looked into the pit prepared to take her — was no room for any work in the close clay : from the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her, crying, 'get up, little alice ! it is day.' if you listen by that grave, in sun and shower, with your ear down, little alice never cries ; could we see her face, be sure we should not know her, for the smile has time for growing in her eyes ,— and merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in the shroud, by the kirk-chime ! it is good when it happens," say the children, "that we die before our time !"  alas, the wretched children ! they are seeking death in life, as best to have ! they are binding up their hearts away from breaking, with a cerement from the grave. go out, children, from the mine and from the city — sing out, children, as the little thrushes do — pluck you handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through ! but they answer, " are your cowslips of the meadows like our weeds anear the mine ? leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows, from your pleasures fair and fine!  "for oh," say the children, "we are weary, and we cannot run or leap — if we cared for any meadows, it were merely to drop down in them and sleep. our knees tremble sorely in the stooping — we fall upon our faces, trying to go ; and, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping, the reddest flower would look as pale as snow. for, all day, we drag our burden tiring, through the coal-dark, underground — or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron in the factories, round and round.  "for all day, the wheels are droning, turning, — their wind comes in our faces, — till our hearts turn, — our heads, with pulses burning, and the walls turn in their places turns the sky in the high window blank and reeling — turns the long light that droppeth down the wall, — turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling — all are turning, all the day, and we with all ! — and all day, the iron wheels are droning ; and sometimes we could pray, 'o ye wheels,' (breaking out in a mad moaning) 'stop ! be silent for to-day ! ' "  ay ! be silent ! let them hear each other breathing for a moment, mouth to mouth — let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing of their tender human youth ! let them feel that this cold metallic motion is not all the life god fashions or reveals — let them prove their inward souls against the notion that they live in you, or under you, o wheels ! — still, all day, the iron wheels go onward, as if fate in each were stark ; and the children's souls, which god is calling sunward, spin on blindly in the dark.  now tell the poor young children, o my brothers, to look up to him and pray — so the blessed one, who blesseth all the others, will bless them another day. they answer, " who is god that he should hear us, while the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred ? when we sob aloud, the human creatures near us pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word ! and we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding) strangers speaking at the door : is it likely god, with angels singing round him, hears our weeping any more ?  " two words, indeed, of praying we remember ; and at midnight's hour of harm, — 'our father,' looking upward in the chamber, we say softly for a charm. we know no other words, except 'our father,' and we think that, in some pause of angels' song, god may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather, and hold both within his right hand which is strong. 'our father !' if he heard us, he would surely (for they call him good and mild) answer, smiling down the steep world very purely, 'come and rest with me, my child.'  "but, no !" say the children, weeping faster, " he is speechless as a stone ; and they tell us, of his image is the master who commands us to work on. go to ! " say the children,—"up in heaven, dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find ! do not mock us ; grief has made us unbelieving — we look up for god, but tears have made us blind." do ye hear the children weeping and disproving, o my brothers, what ye preach ? for god's possible is taught by his world's loving — and the children doubt of each.  and well may the children weep before you ; they are weary ere they run ; they have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory which is brighter than the sun : they know the grief of man, without its wisdom ; they sink in the despair, without its calm — are slaves, without the liberty in christdom, — are martyrs, by the pang without the palm, — are worn, as if with age, yet unretrievingly no dear remembrance keep,— are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly : let them weep ! let them weep !  they look up, with their pale and sunken faces, and their look is dread to see, for they think you see their angels in their places, with eyes meant for deity ;— "how long," they say, "how long, o cruel nation, will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart, — stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation, and tread onward to your throne amid the mart ? our blood splashes upward, o our tyrants, and your purple shews your path ; but the child's sob curseth deeper in the silence than the strong man in his wrath !"

 dogs so long with us we forget that wolves allowed as how they might be tamed and sprang up all over the globe, with all humans, all at once, like a good idea.  so we tamed our own hearts. leashed them or sent them to camp’s edge. even the shrinks once agreed, in dreams our dogs are our deepest selves.  ur dog, a siberian, dogged the heels of nomads, then turned south to egypt to keep pharaoh safe.  seemed strange, my mother sighed, when finally we got a hound, . . . a house without a dog.  her world never knew a yard un-dogged and thus unlocked. sudden intrusions impossible where yappers yap.  or maybe she objected to empty armchairs, rooms too quiet without the beat of tail thump or paw thud.  n’de, ojibwe say,my pet, which also suggests ode, that spot in the chest, the part you point to when you pray, or say with great feeling—great meaning, meaning dog-love goes that deep.

 some are born to sweet delight. some are born to endless night. —william blake, “auguries of innocence”  we spend our lives trying to grasp the premise. william blake is not, for instance, william blake, but rather a 19th century accountant from cleveland on the lam for murder &amp; the theft of a horse. in the closing scene,  he is going to die, &amp; so is nobody, his half-blackfoot, half-blood guide. sure, this is a western, a morality tale about a destiny made manifest through the voice of a gun &amp; a hero whose mythic flight from innocence  destroys him. but we all come to the end of the line soon enough. the obvious just seems wiser when nobody says it.time, it turns out, is the most common noun in the english language, as if by constant invocation,  we could keep it at bay. yesterday, i sat in another state on a large rubber ball in my brother’s basement bouncing my newborn nephew in my arms. his mother, on the phone with a friend, asks what we should fear more,  the hobo spider or the poison that kills it. i want to whisper into his ear something that feels like knowledge: once upon a time, there was nothing &amp; one day, there will be nothing again. this is the faraway place  to which his tiny weight calls me. if he could understand the words. i think, he would know what i mean, having only just sprung himself from that fine sea. sometimes we coo to soothe him:don’t cry, little bird. i know, i know.  but only the roar of the vacuum finally calms him, for nothing sounds as much like the lost world of the womb as the motors of our machines. the root of travel means torture, having passed from medieval latin  into old french. as the action opens, johnny depp, shot in black &amp; white, is already rocking into night on a train. and soon, he will begin his dying. this is not to say that the inky band fanning across the morning blue  of a kestrel’s tail feathers has no meaning, or the first fingers of rust coming into bloom on the green enameled chassis of a corona typewriter left in the rain. direct observation, the naturalist niko tinbergen assures us,  is the only real thing. perhaps this is what i should tell him. or that this moment, too, is a part of some migration. every snow bunting composes its own song, &amp; a careful watcher can tell one kittiwake from its neighbor by the little dots  on the tips of its wings. the most used verb is also the most humble— merely to be. nobody can teach to william blake the auguries of william blake. we are, instead, our own vatic visions, bumbling prophets. our sense of ourselves as invented as film. later, in an ocean-going canoe lined with cedar boughs, he will drift out into cold breakers, two bullets in his chest. but, here, in his small hat &amp; wire glasses, he still seems sweetly comic. he holds up a letter;  someone’s promised him a job. his fancy plaid suit makes him look like a clown.

 our business is with fruit and leaf and bloom; though they speak with more than just the season's tongue— the colours that they blaze from the dark loam all have something of the jealous tang  of the dead about them. what do we know of their part in this, those secret brothers of the harrow, invigorators of the soil—oiling the dirt so liberally with their essence, their black marrow?  but here's the question. are the flower and fruit held out to us in love, or merely thrust up at us, their masters, like a fist?  or are they the lords, asleep amongst the roots, granting to us in their great largesse this hybrid thing—part brute force, part mute kiss?

 korea might be gay but i do not think you are. korea is a peninsula. you and i are people meaning that we have hair we comb and things to look at. our lips pout and take on the fullness of an adopted meaning.  the fact of the matter is that relentlessness is a hand- shake, a limp fish or glass of lukewarm tea. the fact of the matter is that standing on a stage everything is comic, meaning small and memorable, of the insubstan- tial "universe," a minor disaster or floating chord.  the darkness is outside when i see you, not in.  i laugh when the funny thing gets said, and mostly i laugh inside. on the inside is without curves and artifi- cial spaces, many of them not gay or korea. but when i see you they all run and speech is maybe stammer, sometimes slur.  margaret cho, your tongue might wreak more havoc than in speaks, outside being from the vantage point of escalating stairs, from dark glasses and escapades. the vantage being from a great height, a lighter space on the inside that was formerly before the dark and laugh. we really wait for the funny things before they are said and let go for ever after.  margaret, there are many funny sisters and there are many porn stores. i too think woo lae ok is really petri- fied of its own fish. that there are babies and there are  dykes, that this little piggy has something, that a pubic mound transforms into a public space, not being gay or with outstanding curves, prayerful and abashed, facing the tide, grown over, rediscovered in the woods by strangers and haunted for years and years.

 dear one, the sea smells of nostalgia. we’re beached and bloated, lie on shell sand, oil rigs nowhere seen. it’s long island, and the weather is fine. what to disturb in the heart of a man?  a boy is not a body. a boy is a walk.  shed the machine. must be entirely flesh to fight. must be strategy instead of filling.  what to disrobe, there, centrifugal logic, as in here is a slice of my finger. tell me the circumstance of your dick extension. when we slip into imprecision, we lose control, windowless walls close in. awareness of being in a female body is a tinge of regret. “the human frame to adapt itself to convention though she herself was a woman.” to receive, to be entered, to fret around upon entry. it’s grand. i’m a system. plants tall as wheat to hide in.

 mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table waiting for warren. when she heard his step, she ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage to meet him in the doorway with the news and put him on his guard. ‘silas is back.’ she pushed him outward with her through the door and shut it after her. ‘be kind,’ she said. she took the market things from warren’s arms and set them on the porch, then drew him down to sit beside her on the wooden steps.  ‘when was i ever anything but kind to him? but i’ll not have the fellow back,’ he said. ‘i told him so last haying, didn’t i? if he left then, i said, that ended it. what good is he? who else will harbor him at his age for the little he can do? what help he is there’s no depending on. off he goes always when i need him most. he thinks he ought to earn a little pay, enough at least to buy tobacco with, so he won’t have to beg and be beholden. “all right,” i say, “i can’t afford to pay any fixed wages, though i wish i could.” “someone else can.” “then someone else will have to.” i shouldn’t mind his bettering himself if that was what it was. you can be certain, when he begins like that, there’s someone at him trying to coax him off with pocket-money,— in haying time, when any help is scarce. in winter he comes back to us. i’m done.’  ‘sh! not so loud: he’ll hear you,’ mary said.  ‘i want him to: he’ll have to soon or late.’  ‘he’s worn out. he’s asleep beside the stove. when i came up from rowe’s i found him here, huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, a miserable sight, and frightening, too— you needn’t smile—i didn’t recognize him— i wasn’t looking for him—and he’s changed. wait till you see.’  ‘where did you say he’d been?’  ‘he didn’t say. i dragged him to the house, and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. i tried to make him talk about his travels. nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.’  ‘what did he say? did he say anything?’  ‘but little.’  ‘anything? mary, confess he said he’d come to ditch the meadow for me.’  ‘warren!’  ‘but did he? i just want to know.’  ‘of course he did. what would you have him say? surely you wouldn’t grudge the poor old man some humble way to save his self-respect. he added, if you really care to know, he meant to clear the upper pasture, too. that sounds like something you have heard before? warren, i wish you could have heard the way he jumbled everything. i stopped to look two or three times—he made me feel so queer— to see if he was talking in his sleep. he ran on harold wilson—you remember— the boy you had in haying four years since. he’s finished school, and teaching in his college. silas declares you’ll have to get him back. he says they two will make a team for work: between them they will lay this farm as smooth! the way he mixed that in with other things. he thinks young wilson a likely lad, though daft on education—you know how they fought all through july under the blazing sun, silas up on the cart to build the load, harold along beside to pitch it on.’  ‘yes, i took care to keep well out of earshot.’  ‘well, those days trouble silas like a dream. you wouldn’t think they would. how some things linger! harold’s young college boy’s assurance piqued him. after so many years he still keeps finding good arguments he sees he might have used. i sympathize. i know just how it feels to think of the right thing to say too late. harold’s associated in his mind with latin. he asked me what i thought of harold’s saying he studied latin like the violin because he liked it—that an argument! he said he couldn’t make the boy believe he could find water with a hazel prong— which showed how much good school had ever done him. he wanted to go over that. but most of all he thinks if he could have another chance to teach him how to build a load of hay—’  ‘i know, that’s silas’ one accomplishment. he bundles every forkful in its place, and tags and numbers it for future reference, so he can find and easily dislodge it in the unloading. silas does that well. he takes it out in bunches like big birds’ nests. you never see him standing on the hay he’s trying to lift, straining to lift himself.’  ‘he thinks if he could teach him that, he’d be some good perhaps to someone in the world. he hates to see a boy the fool of books. poor silas, so concerned for other folk, and nothing to look backward to with pride, and nothing to look forward to with hope, so now and never any different.’  part of a moon was falling down the west, dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. its light poured softly in her lap. she saw it and spread her apron to it. she put out her hand among the harp-like morning-glory strings, taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, as if she played unheard some tenderness that wrought on him beside her in the night. ‘warren,’ she said, ‘he has come home to die: you needn’t be afraid he’ll leave you this time.’  ‘home,’ he mocked gently.  ‘yes, what else but home? it all depends on what you mean by home. of course he’s nothing to us, any more than was the hound that came a stranger to us out of the woods, worn out upon the trail.’  ‘home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.’  ‘i should have called it something you somehow haven’t to deserve.’  warren leaned out and took a step or two, picked up a little stick, and brought it back and broke it in his hand and tossed it by. ‘silas has better claim on us you think than on his brother? thirteen little miles as the road winds would bring him to his door. silas has walked that far no doubt today. why didn’t he go there? his brother’s rich, a somebody—director in the bank.’  ‘he never told us that.’  ‘we know it though.’  ‘i think his brother ought to help, of course. i’ll see to that if there is need. he ought of right to take him in, and might be willing to— he may be better than appearances. but have some pity on silas. do you think if he’d had any pride in claiming kin or anything he looked for from his brother, he’d keep so still about him all this time?’  ‘i wonder what’s between them.’  ‘i can tell you. silas is what he is—we wouldn’t mind him— but just the kind that kinsfolk can’t abide. he never did a thing so very bad. he don’t know why he isn’t quite as good as anyone. worthless though he is, he won’t be made ashamed to please his brother.’  ‘i can’t think si ever hurt anyone.’  ‘no, but he hurt my heart the way he lay and rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. he wouldn’t let me put him on the lounge. you must go in and see what you can do. i made the bed up for him there tonight. you’ll be surprised at him—how much he’s broken. his working days are done; i'm sure of it.’  ‘i’d not be in a hurry to say that.’  ‘i haven’t been. go, look, see for yourself. but, warren, please remember how it is: he’s come to help you ditch the meadow. he has a plan. you mustn’t laugh at him. he may not speak of it, and then he may. i’ll sit and see if that small sailing cloud will hit or miss the moon.’  it hit the moon. then there were three there, making a dim row, the moon, the little silver cloud, and she.  warren returned—too soon, it seemed to her, slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.  ‘warren,’ she questioned.  ‘dead,’ was all he answered.

 for my mother and father apparently i’m mom’s immaculately-conceived irish-american son, because, social-security time come, my cherokee dad could not prove he’d been born.  he could pay taxes, though, financing troops, who’d conquered our land, and could go to jail, the time he had to shoot or die, by a caucasian attacker’s knife.  eluding recreational killers’ calendar’s enforcers, while hunting my family’s food, i thought what the hunted think, so that i ate, not only meat but the days of wild animals fed by the days of seeds, themselves eating earth’s aeons of lives, fed by the sun, rising and falling, as quail, hurtling through sky,  fell, from gun-powder, come— as the first americans came— from asia.  explosions in cannon, i have an english name, a german-chilean-american wife and could live a white life, but, with this hand, with which i write, i dug, my sixteenth summer, a winter’s supply of yams out of hard, battlefield clay, dug for my father’s mother, who— abandoned by her husband—raised, alone, a mixed-blood family and raised—her tongue spading air— ancestors, a winter’s supply or more.

 toss in some wavy lines, an equal sign, and a squiggle, then a lilac log, boulders with faces, a few phrases like rock walls, twin marks from wagon wheels on granite. the tell-tale lilacs give away the cellar hole: magnetic lilacs, like nineteenth-century girls in pinafores and blossom sprays, stationed beside their no-longer houses. they look about to sing. banana curls. purple ribbons tying their waists. and boulders in the woods act as billboards interrupted by an enormous mont blanc fountain pen, lounging like an alligator. it intrudes. comes out of my present time. no. be less. it's a bic ballpoint. bleached by deletion, "by the middle of the nineteenth century, when de forestation reached its peak, more than half of new england's native forests"—according to robert m. thorson, stone by stone—"as much as 80 percent in the heavily settled parts of southern new england—had been cut down," "replaced with 'open space,'" the autumn foliage is paint-by-number and different tabs throughout are half-finished murals of a single type of tree in a single time of year. here's the place where someone w/ a pewter spoon kneeled to plant the lady's slippers that still appear, and the mushrooms like a stack of dinner plates that run up the side of a rotting tree. here's the fallen-in deer stand and the apple tree among maples making fruit for deer. outside the woods, the puff of dust on the road where the school bus used to stop. outside is the failure to stay in touch or, really, to ever be in touch. i didn't ever know them (my neighbors) well. in winter you are handed a white tray with a few tiny rock walls, short lines drawn with a ruler, an indent for where a cellar hole could be a hyperlink to once go once more to the lake and told to go at it, go play.

 baton rouge, 1940 these are savannas bluer than your dreams where other loves are fashioned to older music, and the romantic in his light boat puts out among flamingos and water moccasins looking for the river that went by last year.  even the angels wear confederate uniforms; and when the magnolia blooms and the honeysuckle, golden lovers, brighter than the moon, read catullus in the flaring light of the burning negro in the open eye of midnight.  and the traveller, moving in the hot swamps, where every human sympathy sends up the temperature, comes of a sudden on the hidden glacier, whose motives are blonder than hitler’s choir boys.  here is the ambiguous tenderness of ’gators trumpeting their loves along a hundred miles of rivers writhing under trees like myths— and human existence pursues the last, the simple and desperate life of the senses. since love survives only as ironic legend— response to situations no longer present— men lacking dignity are seized by pride, which is the easy upper-class infection.  the masters are at home in this merciless climate but deep in the caves of their minds some animal memory warns of the fate of the mammoth at the end of the ice-age; as sleeping children a toy, they hug the last, fatal error, but their eyes are awake and their dreams shake as with palsy.  over birmingham where the blast furnace flowers and beyond the piney woods in cotton country, continually puzzling the pale aristocrats, the sun burns equally white man and black.  the labor which they do makes more and more their brotherhood condition for their whole existence; they mint their own light, and their fusing fires will melt at last these centuries of ice.  this is a nightmare nimble in the big house, where sleepers are wakeful, cuddling their terror, in the empty acres of their rich beds, dreaming of bones in museums, where the black boys yawn.

 if you are going there by foot, prepare to get wet. you are not you anymore.  you are a girl standing in a pool of clouds as they catch fire in the distance.  there are laws of   heaven and those of   place and those who see the sky in the water,  angels in ashes that are the delta’s now. they say if you sweep the trash from your house  after dark, you sweep away your luck. if you are going by foot, bring a stick,  a third leg, and honor the great disorder, the great broom of waterfowl and songbirds.  prepare to voodoo your way, best you can, knowing there is a little water in things  you take for granted, a little charity and squalor for the smallest forms of life.  voodoo was always mostly charity. people forget. if you shake a tablecloth  outside at night, someone in your family dies. there are laws we make thinking  it was us who made them. we are not us. we are a floodplain by the mississippi  that once poured slaves upriver to the fields. we are a hurricane in the making.  we could use a magus who knows something about suffering, who knows a delta’s needs.  we understand if   you want a widow to stay single, cut up her husband’s shoes.  he is not himself anyway and walks barefoot across a landscape that has no north.  only a ghost tree here and there, a frog, a cricket, a bird. and if the fates are kind,  a girl with a stick, who is more at home, being homeless, than you will ever be.

 as i stood upon london bridge and viewed the mighty throng of thousands of people in cabs and ’busses rapidly whirling along, all furiously driving to and fro, up one street and down another as quick as they could go:  then i was struck with the discordant sound of human voices there, which seemed to me like wild geese cackling in the air: and the river thames is a most beautiful sight, to see the steamers sailing upon it by day and by night.  and the tower of london is most gloomy to behold, and the crown of england lies there, begemmed with precious stones and gold; king henry the sixth was murdered there by the duke of glo’ster, and when he killed him with his sword he called him an impostor.  st. paul’s cathedral is the finest building that ever i did see, there’s no building can surpass it in the city of dundee, because it’s magnificent to behold, with its beautiful dome and spire glottering like gold.  and as for nelson’s monument that stands in trafalgar square, it is a most stately monument i most solemnly declare, and towering defiantly very high, which arrests strangers’ attention while passing by.  then there’s two beautiful water-fountains spouting up very high, where the weary traveller can drink when he feels dry; and at the foot of the monument there’s three bronze lions in grand array, enough to make the stranger’s heart throb with dismay.  then there’s mr spurgeon, a great preacher, which no one dare gainsay, i went to hear him preach on the sabbath-day, and he made my heart feel light and gay, when i heard him preach and pray.  and the tabernacle was crowded from ceiling to floor, and many were standing outside the door; he is an eloquent preacher i honestly declare, and i was struck with admiration as on him i did stare.  then there’s petticoat lane i venture to say, it’s a wonderful place on the sabbath-day; there wearing-apparel can be bought to suit the young or old, for the ready cash, silver, coppers, or gold.  oh! mighty city of london! you are wonderful to see, and thy beauties no doubt fill the tourist’s heart with glee; but during my short stay, and while wandering there, mr spurgeon was the only man i heard speaking proper english i do declare.

 under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders, i pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt, cracked a square of window pane, the gummed latch, and swung the window, crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room of canton elementary school, once canton high, where my father served three extra years as star halfback and sprinter. behind a flashlight’s cane of light, i climbed a staircase almost a ladder and found a door. on the second nudge of my shoulder, it broke into a hallway dark as history, at whose end lay the classroom i had studied over and over in the deep obsession of memory.  i swept that room with my light—an empty blackboard, a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor like a punctured basketball—then followed that beam across the rows of desks, the various catalogs of lovers, the lists of all those who would and would not do what, until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row, and i saw again, after many years the name of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top.  to gauge the depth i ran my finger across that scar, and wondered at the dreams he must have lived as his eyes ran back and forth from the cinder yard below the window to the empty practice field to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully the long, angular lines of his name, the dreams he must have laid out one behind another like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed of savo sound or guadalcanal. in honor of dreams i sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor, and stood my flashlight on its end. half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk, the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling, and in that split light i tapped the hammer easy up the overhang of the desk top. nothing gave but the walls’ sharp echo, so i swung again, and again harder, and harder still in half anger rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear of my first crime against the city, the county, the state, whatever government claimed dominion, until i had hammered up in the ringing dark a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced the flashlight, the classroom spinning black as a coma. i’ve often pictured the face of the teacher whose student first pointed to that topless desk, the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row, their eyes meeting over the question of absence. i’ve wondered too if some low authority of the system discovered that shattered window, and finding no typewriters, no business machines, no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it, so let it pass as minor vandalism. i’ve heard nothing. and rarely do i fret when i see that oak scar leaning against my basement wall, though i wonder what it means to own my father’s name.

 the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold, and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold; and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea, when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee.  like the leaves of the forest when summer is green, that host with their banners at sunset were seen: like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown, that host on the morrow lay withered and strown.  for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast, and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed; and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill, and their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!  and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide, but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride; and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf, and cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.  and there lay the rider distorted and pale, with the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail: and the tents were all silent, the banners alone, the lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.  and the widows of ashur are loud in their wail, and the idols are broke in the temple of baal; and the might of the gentile, unsmote by the sword, hath melted like snow in the glance of the lord!

 newspaper says the boy killed by someone, don’t say who. i know the mother, waking, gets up as usual, washes her face in cold water, and starts the coffee pot.  she stands by the window up there on floor sixteen wondering why the street’s so calm with no cars going or coming, and then she looks at the wall clock and sees the time.  now she’s too awake to go back to bed, she’s too awake not to remember him, her one son, or to forget exactly how long yesterday was, each moment dragged  into the next by the force of her will until she thought this simply cannot be. she sits at the scarred, white kitchen table, the two black windows staring back at her,  wondering how she’ll go back to work today. the windows don’t see anything: they’re black, eyeless, they give back only what’s given; sometimes, like now, even less than what’s given,  yet she stares into their two black faces moving her head from side to side, like this, just like i’m doing now. try it awhile, go ahead, it’s not going to kill you.  now say something, it doesn’t matter what you say because all the words are useless: “i’m sorry for your loss.” “this too will pass.” “he was who he was.” she won’t hear you out  because she can only hear the torn words she uses to pray to die. this afternoon you and i will see her just before four alight nimbly from the bus, her lunch box  of one sandwich, a thermos of coffee, a navel orange secured under her arm, and we’ll look away. under your breath make her one promise and keep it forever:  in the little store-front church down the block, the one with the front windows newspapered, you won’t come on saturday or sunday to kneel down and pray for life eternal.

 i don’t mind the human race. i’ve got pretty used to them in these past twenty-five years. i don’t mind if they sit next to me on streetcars, or eat in the same restaurants, if it’s not at the same table. however, i don’t approve of a woman i respect dancing with one of them. i’ve tried asking them to my home without success. i shouldn’t care to see my own sister marry one. even if she loved him, think of the children. their art is interesting, but certainly barbarous. i’m sure, if given a chance, they’d kill us all in our beds. and you must admit, they smell.

 and that other time after we got carjacked in l.a. on the way home from spago. like a scene outta that movie i don’t like about those hoes i don’t love. it is hard out there for a pimp. a white woman and her brown babies /brown babies in a fancy car with unlocked doors. most everything is semi-automatic. two black men hopped into the front row seats and started waving guns like pom-poms.we made it! we made it! right against the rim of her porcelain brain. all they wanted was the car and the color. the car was white like her. she saved our lives. then the penguins came over with a book full of photos of black men, so serious like kings in their mugging, and they asked us to pick which two it was. i was five but i could feel the shrugged evil of it so true and impossible to touch as i pretended to recognize us. we closed our eyes and pointed at you, and said,i don’t know that man. je ne connais pas cet homme. we saved our lives. we tugged at the flashlight looking for bruises and found you awake, and found a way.  
NEW POEM
 do not despair of man, and do not scold him, who are you that you should so lightly hold him? are you not also a man, and in your heart are there not warlike thoughts and fear and smart? are you not also afraid and in fear cruel, do you not think of yourself as usual, faint for ambition, desire to be loved, prick at a virtuous thought by beauty moved? you love your wife, you hold your children dear, then say not that man is vile, but say they are. but they are not. so is your judgement shown presumptuous, false, quite vain, merely your own sadness for failed ambition set outside, made a philosophy of, prinked, beautified in noble dress and into the world sent out to run with the ill it most pretends to rout. oh know your own heart, that heart's not wholly evil, and from the particular judge the general, if judge you must, but with compassion see life, or else, of yourself despairing, flee strife.  
NEW POEM
 do not embrace your mind’s new negro friend or embarrass the blackballed jew with memberships: there must be years of atonement first, and even then you may still be the blundering raconteur with the wrong story, and they may still be free.  if you are with them, if even mind is friend, there will be plenty to do: give the liars lessons who have heard no rumors of truth for a long time but have whatever they hear on good authority, whether it concerns chinese women or the arts.  expose the patrons, some of whose best friends are brothers, and who are never now anonymous: what kind of credit do they expect for that, ask them, or better, ask their protested brothers, the grateful tenants who can’t get their curtsies right.  finally the injured, who think they have no friend, who have been convinced by the repeated names that they are jews or negroes or some dark thing: they must be courted with the lover’s touch and as guiltily as if yourself had turned them inward.  if you complete this program, you will have friends from all the rich races of your human blood: meantime, engage in the often friendless struggle. a long war, a pygmy war in ways, but island by island we must go across.

 no other man, unless it was doc hill, did more for people in this town than l. and all the weak, the halt, the improvident and those who could not pay flocked to me. i was good-hearted, easy doctor meyers. i was healthy, happy, in comfortable fortune, blest with a congenial mate, my children raised, all wedded, doing well in the world. and then one night, minerva, the poetess, came to me in her trouble, crying. i tried to help her out—she died— they indicted me, the newspapers disgraced me, my wife perished of a broken heart. and pneumonia finished me.  
NEW POEM
 the city where i grew up was not a western city, nor an eastern city. it lay north of bohemia, south of greenland, below sandstone switzerland in a river valley, green with fields. it was the dump in the middle, the rump of an exquisite gesture in stone — a suite in hotel “old europe.”  stuck under layers of wallpaper, newspapers from a world gone by: reports of zeppelin flights, league of nations conferences, “miscellaneous,” alongside adverts for brassieres and ironing boards. but the view to the river was blocked with gray barracks. and the southern wing, and the northern wing, broken like the baroque palace, furnishings given for junk. all of it somehow stranded: the steamers and churches, the domes. and not much life in the bar.  but then i found it one day down on the banks, under rusty nails, heaps of nuts and bolts from machines long since dismantled, factories expropriated, torn-down, i found it amongst the bones, unearthed by scavenging dogs, ribs and vertebrae, splinters of human and beast, so it seemed — the key to the city. and found a kind of peace. and knew where i was, and where i came from —  until i saw the photographs, not the ones at home in the album, but for sale on the street market stall. archive pictures, postcards of street scenes, city views from between the wars, moments from a life gone by, some still with the stamp “original print, by hand.”  past the housefronts, all still intact, over the bridges, the broad terraces, along the königsufer, the banks of the elbe, people walking, all dead now, but the youngest in their prams. mothers in dark coats and hats were chained for all time to this or that man with a briefcase. on a traffic island, a boy in lederhosen who would never age, staring from the poster for “riquet cocoa chocolate.” “alsberg ladies wear, wilsdruffer straße: the new bathing costume from alsberg.” and the beauty in silk stockings, getting out of the tram, no. 11, picked out by chance, and her too, fixed in that spot forever. all of them passersby in time — the girl at the flower stall on altmarkt, the one by the striped awnings on prager straße. at the station the clock forever at half past ten.  a morning that lasts for eternity — mostly in spring, in summer, in a city that was not eastern, nor western. scarcely a photo that ever showed it in deep snow. the sign for dresdner neueste nachrichten stood by the entrance to the subway. soon an r was missing, an n, then an a. power cuts, petrol grew scarce, people took to bikes again after stalingrad. not long now and almost all of it will be erased, a phantasmagoria like the desert palace of kubla khan. and your gaze leaped back and forth looking for the place it all began.   was it the high tide? the moment that saw the sparkling twenties in. people peering over the railings at brühl’s terrace, dismayed at the rising of the elbe. like mourners at a wake all clothed in black. an entire people clothed in black, back then. though the worst was behind them: four years of war in europe, carnage. all of them losers, people suddenly with time on their hands, time to gather in dark clumps. only a girl in a sailor suit, laughing and spitting over the railing into the swollen, mud-brown river, cold as the grave.  or maybe the storm in the thirties, that wrecks the funfair booths at the vogelwiese fairground. visitors watch the chaos in despair. ghost train guests.roll up and test your strength  
NEW POEM
 were i to fall in love all over again, it would be with this low ceiling, with the calm  faces of  the two men going about their craft, and with her, now twisting towards them, beautiful, defiant and free.  because we forget how beauty was once itself and nothing else, how it held its stellar moment in attic and cellar.  because that is what beauty is, this compact with time and the silence of  concentration on one subversive operation,  that requires courage and sacrifice and never comes without a price.

 for robert duncan it is hard going to the door cut so small in the wall where the vision which echoes loneliness brings a scent of wild flowers in a wood.  what i understood, i understand. my mind is sometime torment, sometimes good and filled with livelihood, and feels the ground.  but i see the door, and knew the wall, and wanted the wood, and would get there if i could with my feet and hands and mind.  lady, do not banish me for digressions. my nature is a quagmire of unresolved confessions. lady, i follow.  i walked away from myself, i left the room, i found the garden, i knew the woman in it, together we lay down.  dead night remembers. in december we change, not multiplied but dispersed, sneaked out of childhood, the ritual of dismemberment.  mighty magic is a mother, in her there is another issue of fixture, repeated form, the race renewal, the charge of the command.  the garden echoes across the room. it is fixed in the wall like a mirror that faces a window behind you and reflects the shadows.  may i go now? am i allowed to bow myself down in the ridiculous posture of renewal, of the insistence of which i am the virtue?  nothing for you is untoward. inside you would also be tall, more tall, more beautiful. come toward me from the wall, i want to be with you.  so i screamed to you, who hears as the wind, and changes multiply, invariably, changes in the mind.  running to the door, i ran down as a clock runs down. walked backwards, stumbled, sat down hard on the floor near the wall.  where were you. how absurd, how vicious. there is nothing to do but get up. my knees were iron, i rusted in worship, of you.  for that one sings, one writes the spring poem, one goes on walking. the lady has always moved to the next town and you stumble on after her.  the door in the wall leads to the garden where in the sunlight sit the graces in long victorian dresses, of which my grandmother had spoken.  history sings in their faces. they are young, they are obtainable, and you follow after them also in the service of god and truth.  but the lady is indefinable, she will be the door in the wall to the garden in sunlight. i will go on talking forever.  i will never get there. oh lady, remember me who in your service grows older not wiser, no more than before.  how can i die alone. where will i be then who am now alone, what groans so pathetically in this room where i am alone?  i will go to the garden. i will be a romantic. i will sell myself in hell, in heaven also i will be.  in my mind i see the door, i see the sunlight before me across the floor beckon to me, as the lady’s skirt moves small beyond it.

 for rafael heliodoro valle i set out from the port of acapulco on the twenty-third of march and kept a steady course until saturday, the fourth of april, when a half hour before dawn, we saw by the light of the moon that a ship had come alongside with sails and a bow that seemed to be of silver. our helmsman cried out to them to stand off but no one answered, as though they were all asleep. again we called out: “ where did their ship come from ?” and they said: peru! after which we heard trumpets, and muskets firing, and they ordered me to come down into their longboat to cross over to where their captain was. i found him walking the deck, went up to him, kissed his hands and he asked me: “what silver or gold i had aboard that ship?” i said, “none at all, none at all, my lord, only my dishes and cups.” so then he asked me if i knew the viceroy. i said i did. and i asked the captain, “if he were captain drake himself and no other?” the captain replied that “he was the very drake i spoke of.” we spoke together a long time, until the hour of dinner, and he commanded that i sit by his side. his dishes and cups are of silver, bordered with gold with his crest upon them. he has with him many perfumes and scented waters in crystal vials which, he said, the queen had given him. he dines and sups always with music of violins and also takes with him everywhere painters who keep painting all the coast for him. he is a man of some twenty-four years, small, with a reddish beard. he is a nephew of juan aquinas,* the pirate. and is one of the greatest mariners there are upon the sea. the day after, which was sunday, he clothed himself in splendid garments and had them hoist all their flags with pennants of divers colors at the mastheads, the bronze rings, and chains, and the railings and the lights on the alcazar shining like gold. his ship was like a gold dragon among the dolphins. and we went, with his page, to my ship to look at the coffers. all day long until night he spent looking at what i had. what he took from me was not much, a few trifles of my own, and he gave me a cutlass and a silver brassart for them, asking me to forgive him since it was for his lady that he was taking them: he would let me go, he said, the next morning, as soon as there was a breeze; for this i thanked him, and kissed his hands. he is carrying, in his galleon, three thousand bars of silver three coffers full of gold twelve great coffers of pieces of eight: and he says he is heading for china following the charts and steered by a chinese pilot whom he captured ...

 in the old, scratched, cheap wood of the typing stand there is a landscape, veined, which only a child can see or the child’s older self, a poet, a woman dreaming when she should be typing the last report of the day. if this were a map, she thinks, a map laid down to memorize because she might be walking it, it shows ridge upon ridge fading into hazed desert here and there a sign of aquifers and one possible watering-hole. if this were a map it would be the map of the last age of her life, not a map of choices but a map of variations on the one great choice. it would be the map by which she could see the end of touristic choices, of distances blued and purpled by romance, by which she would recognize that poetry isn’t revolution but a way of knowing why it must come. if this cheap, mass-produced wooden stand from the brooklyn union gas co., mass-produced yet durable, being here now, is what it is yet a dream-map so obdurate, so plain, she thinks, the material and the dream can join and that is the poem and that is the late report.   october/november 1987

 according to mister hedges, the custodian who called upon their parents after young otwiner and young julia were spotted at the matinee of rudolph valentino in the sheik at the segregated knickerbocker theater in the uncommon washington december of 1922, “your young ladies were misrepresenting themselves today,” meaning, of course, that they were passing. after coffee and no cake were finished and mister hedges had buttoned his coat against the strange evening chill, choice words were had with otwiner and julia, shame upon the family, shame upon the race.  how they’d longed to see rudolph valentino, who was swarthy like a negro, like the finest negro man. in the sheik, they’d heard, he was turbaned, whisked damsels away in a desert cloud. they’d heard this from lucille and ella who’d put on their fine frocks and french, claiming to be “of foreign extraction” to sneak into the knickerbocker theater past the usher who knew their parents but did not know them. they’d heard this from mignon and doris who’d painted carmine bindis on their foreheads braided their black hair tight down the back, and huffed, “we’ll have to take this up with the embassy” to the squinting ticket taker. otwiner and julia were tired of oscar michaux, tired of church, tired of responsibility, rectitude, posture, grooming, modulation, tired of homilies each way they turned, tired of colored right and wrong. they wanted to be whisked away.  the morning after mister hedges’ visit the paperboy cried “extra!” and papas shrugged camel’s hair topcoats over pressed pajamas, and mamas read aloud at the breakfast table, “no colored killed when roof caves in” at the knickerbocker theater at the evening show from a surfeit of snow on the roof. one hundred others dead.  it appeared that god had spoken. there was no school that day, no movies for months after.

 that bummy smell you meet off the escalator at civic center, right before you turn onto mcallister, seems to dwell there, disembodied, on a shelf above the sidewalk.  the mad old lady with lizard skin bent double over her shopping cart and trailing a cloud of pigeons is nowhere in sight.  a pile of rags here and there but no one underneath. an invisible shrine commemorating what? old mattresses and dusty flesh,  piss and puked-on overcoats, what? maybe death, now there’s a smell that likes to stick around. you used to find it in downtown sally anns and once  in a hospital cafeteria, only faintly, after a bite of poundcake. but here it lives, cheek by jowl with mcdonald’s, still robust after a night of wind  with its own dark little howdy-do for the drunks and cops, social workers and whores, or the elderly couple from zurich leafing cooly through their guidebook.  
NEW POEM
 i have met them at close of day coming with vivid faces from counter or desk among grey eighteenth-century houses. i have passed with a nod of the head or polite meaningless words, or have lingered awhile and said polite meaningless words, and thought before i had done of a mocking tale or a gibe to please a companion around the fire at the club, being certain that they and i but lived where motley is worn: all changed, changed utterly: a terrible beauty is born.  that woman's days were spent in ignorant good-will, her nights in argument until her voice grew shrill. what voice more sweet than hers when, young and beautiful, she rode to harriers? this man had kept a school and rode our wingèd horse; this other his helper and friend was coming into his force; he might have won fame in the end, so sensitive his nature seemed, so daring and sweet his thought. this other man i had dreamed a drunken, vainglorious lout. he had done most bitter wrong to some who are near my heart, yet i number him in the song; he, too, has resigned his part in the casual comedy; he, too, has been changed in his turn, transformed utterly: a terrible beauty is born.  hearts with one purpose alone through summer and winter seem enchanted to a stone to trouble the living stream. the horse that comes from the road, the rider, the birds that range from cloud to tumbling cloud, minute by minute they change; a shadow of cloud on the stream changes minute by minute; a horse-hoof slides on the brim, and a horse plashes within it; the long-legged moor-hens dive, and hens to moor-cocks call; minute by minute they live: the stone's in the midst of all.  too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart. o when may it suffice? that is heaven's part, our part to murmur name upon name, as a mother names her child when sleep at last has come on limbs that had run wild. what is it but nightfall? no, no, not night but death; was it needless death after all? for england may keep faith for all that is done and said. we know their dream; enough to know they dreamed and are dead; and what if excess of love bewildered them till they died? i write it out in a verse— macdonagh and macbride and connolly and pearse now and in time to be, wherever green is worn, are changed, changed utterly: a terrible beauty is born.

 i wonder if anyone ever thought to tell time with them     know where their shadow tipped on 3 o'clock    which floor   which parking spot from a window desk    or if they ever stood completely over their own shade's dot that moment they had no metered footprint; a peek-a-boo we now find ticketed as a before and an after    an either side of a space the zero pulls into, its long reserve wheel of nothing there. yet here a gnomon of absence bears its shadow placement on some dial of brevity and cold about life       about the footprint we may leave empty of light    empty of even point to it.    here it's flat and densely packed with people unlike the empty open of the plain; here our expanse    the grown over dumpsite of the meadowlands wetlands or the shore is corps of engineered   the bulldozer-beetle's ball of dung shines in it       and somewhere the body hidden in our shit to fake us innocent... one of our jokes sometimes      things rise and float.  we in the morning catch, from the train, in the green garbage runoff, sight of white herons and the cormorants. when they’re there in the evening, we safely assume the world hasn’t gone anywhere; a take of bearings       the same the next morning when we’d see the lit towers on the island we were headed for      we see now the hour.    from the jersey side we take a bearing, as on mountains from the vantage of the plain, on the towers from the vantage of the dirt-stiffened, unyielding, tarmac of marsh grass     gray like steel grayed a vegetable steel from blur and the exhausts of the turnpike.  position with regard to surrounding objects here is unlike in the mountains which give a bearing even from deep within them, let you see them from inside their formation.  climbing to the high plateau of the street from the subway, we check the peaks downtown or midtown    skyscrapers for direction. walk a few doors up the block    they parallax eclipsed by the postcard we no more see.   *   there was a deep well lit its entire depth at noon on the solstice       light without shadow:  so with an in-line position with regard to the sun       any cast line of shadow  would indicate a curve; the distance between one and not,   an arc of circumference.  that phrase of the psalm says death’s shadow is as deep as that valley which is our grave;  its length is the same cast everywhere       as deep; no one’s is further from death than another’s;  death surrounds us       is our uncurbed circumference. we map our way with only the bearing  of surrounding life      itself borderless uncontrolled by the surface of our self.    the bridge towers of the verrazano are so far apart they tilt away from each other on the curve of the earth   factored in.  i wonder if from the distance apart of the the towers you could figure that reach ‘round of the world with this method of shadow?  the shadow of flesh casts how deep and far a landscape of perspective?       how round a circumference enough to fit the living  world   does a single life turning to its labor spin? take each story of a building as the radius of expansion      we make of the earth,  concentric spheres       on turtle island, the hundred ten circumferences go nova    so high a reach of vision set on so short a perspective       the world on the turtle's back: at top, the wake of star formation    at base, the animal  god.     the jealous need,    a stomach of feet       trying to stand through this.  what can we say of our own that stand in newark say       so far adrift from a chance  to wash      that the dirt on her feet cracks into sores the skin of her soles    and steps her in one more shit infection she has to kick,  one more occupation of her body by her monkey rulers she will have to throw off into space       off her back       burned out but clear  of starring habit.       of her destroyed sun    say it endows the landfill       on which to build a new development       “we are the stuff of stars,” sagan says.

 in ’29 before the dust storms sandblasted indianapolis, we believed in the milk company. milk came in glass bottles. we spread dye-colored butter, now connected to cancer. we worked seven to seven with no overtime pay; pledged allegiance every day, pitied the starving armenians. one morning in the midst of plenty, there were folks out of context, who were living on nothing. some slept in shacks on the banks of the river. this phenomenon investors said would pass away. my father worked for the daily paper. he was a union printer; lead slugs and blue smoke. he worked with hot lead at a two-ton machine, in a low-slung seat; a green-billed cap pulled low on his forehead. he gave my mother a dollar a day. you could say we were rich. this was the jazz age. all over the country the dispossessed wandered with their hungry children, harassed by the law. when the market broke, bad losers jumped out of windows. it was time to lay an elegant table, as it is now; corporate paradise; the apple before the rot caved in. it was the same worm eating the same fruit. in fact, the same eden.

 thomas edison loved a doll with a tiny phonograph inside because he made her speak.  is there any other reason to love a woman? did she say the ghost of my conception  or something equally demure? it’s hard to be sure how he feels when he holds me, i fall apart.  i’m projecting here. he didn’t feel her first transgression was in having no expression.  rené descartes, too, traveled alone with a doll-in-a-box he called his daughter.francine,  francine... is it better to be silent and wait for everything we were promised?  or should we love them back, the way a train loves its destination, as if we have the machinery necessary for it?

 :  speak to me.          take my hand.            what are you now? i will tell you all.          i will conceal nothing. when i was three, a little child read a story about a rabbit who died, in the story, and i crawled under a chair    : a pink rabbit    :    it was my birthday, and a candle burnt a sore spot on my finger, and i was told to be happy.  :  oh, grow to know me.        i am not happy.        i will be open: now i am thinking of white sails against a sky like music, like glad horns blowing, and birds tilting, and an arm about me. there was one i loved, who wanted to live, sailing.  :  speak to me.        take my hand.        what are you now? when i was nine, i was fruitily sentimental, fluid    :    and my widowed aunt played chopin, and i bent my head on the painted woodwork, and wept. i want now to be close to you.        i would link the minutes of my days close, somehow, to your days.  :  i am not happy.          i will be open. i have liked lamps in evening corners, and quiet poems. there has been fear in my life.          sometimes i speculate on what a tragedy his life was, really.  :  take my hand.          fist my mind in your hand.          what are you now? when i was fourteen, i had dreams of suicide, and i stood at a steep window, at sunset, hoping toward death   : if the light had not melted clouds and plains to beauty, if light had not transformed that day, i would have leapt. i am unhappy.          i am lonely.          speak to me.  :  i will be open.          i think he never loved me: he loved the bright beaches, the little lips of foam that ride small waves, he loved the veer of gulls: he said with a gay mouth: i love you.          grow to know me.  :  what are you now?          if we could touch one another, if these our separate entities could come to grips, clenched like a chinese puzzle . . . yesterday i stood in a crowded street that was live with people, and no one spoke a word, and the morning shone. everyone silent, moving. . . . take my hand.          speak to me.

 el patio de mi casa, 1990, by maría brito my patio was once a schoolyard, or maybe a barracoon, perhaps both, &amp; the ghosts of children nest under the pink sink, mouths agape for flakes of rust, or they creep to the ceiling, sucking on the five taps of blue water, their little lips abuzz like cicadas. in the moonlight i see them bounce on my feather bed, bowed like an old donkey’s back, or they teeter-totter in my wicker chair darned with burlap string. leave them alone, i say to my mother, who wants to cleanse the house with carvacrol, trapping these children’s souls in beehives, then stringing them up with kites so they fly to the moon. let them drum our dented pots, let them screech happy carols, let them dance with tin spurs on their little feet. mother, i don’t care if they nibble our family photos, soil your heirlooms of lace, or steal what few grains of rice (more like gypsum ants) you hoard in the pink pantry. let them play cat’s cradle with spiderwebs, let them rummage in your armoire of moths, let them lurk in your shadows of ill will &amp; tease you to laughter. ghosts are unruly, free to be fickle, unlike me, the pig-tailed girl you kept strapped to the sewing machine in the shed of planks by the mango tree too old to fruit. work &amp; sweat will set you free, you said, just like fidel on the radio. cut me out of those sepia photos on the wall, burn those baby braids you keep in porcelain, toss my first communion gown into the sea. i wish i’d been born into a brood of mice, quick to grow, quick to breed, quick to die among the kapok trees.

 this is not fantasy, this is our life. we are the characters who have invaded the moon, who cannot stop their computers. we are the gods who can unmake the world in seven days.  both hands are stopped at noon. we are beginning to live forever, in lightweight, aluminum bodies with numbers stamped on our backs. we dial our words like muzak. we hear each other through water.  the genre is dead. invent something new. invent a man and a woman naked in a garden, invent a child that will save the world, a man who carries his father out of a burning city. invent a spool of thread that leads a hero to safety, invent an island on which he abandons the woman who saved his life with no loss of sleep over his betrayal.  invent us as we were before our bodies glittered and we stopped bleeding: invent a shepherd who kills a giant, a girl who grows into a tree, a woman who refuses to turn her back on the past and is changed to salt, a boy who steals his brother’s birthright and becomes the head of a nation. invent real tears, hard love, slow-spoken, ancient words, difficult as a child’s first steps across a room.

 in the portrait of jefferson that hangs at monticello, he is rendered two-toned: his forehead white with illumination —  a lit bulb — the rest of his face in shadow, darkened as if the artist meant to contrast his bright knowledge, its dark subtext.  by 1805, when jefferson sat for the portrait, he was already linked to an affair with his slave. against a backdrop, blue  and ethereal, a wash of paint that seems to hold him in relief, jefferson gazes out across the centuries, his lips fixed as if  he's just uttered some final word. the first time i saw the painting, i listened as my father explained the contradictions:  how jefferson hated slavery, though —out of necessity, my father said — had to own slaves; that his moral philosophy meant  he could not have fathered those children: would have been impossible, my father said. for years we debated the distance between  word and deed. i'd follow my father from book to book, gathering citations, listening as he named — like a field guide to virginia —  each flower and tree and bird as if to prove a man's pursuit of knowledge is greater than his shortcomings, the limits of his vision.  i did not know then the subtext of our story, that my father could imagine jefferson's words made flesh in my flesh —  the improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the whites

 i saw the garden where my aunt had died and her two children and a woman from next door; it was like a burst pod filled with clay.  a mile away in the night i had heard the bombs sing and then burst themselves between cramped houses with bright soft flashes and sounds like banging doors;  the last of them crushed the four bodies into the ground, scattered the shelter, and blasted my uncle’s corpse over the housetop and into the street beyond.  now the garden lay stripped and stale; the iron shelter spread out its separate petals around a smooth clay saucer. small, and so tidy it seemed nobody had ever been there.  when i saw it, the house was blown clean by blast and care. relations had already torn out the new fireplaces; my cousin’s pencils lasted me several years.  and in his office notepad that was given me i found solemn drawings in crayon of blondes without dresses. in his lifetime i had not known him well.  these were the things i noticed at ten years of age: those, and the four hearses outside our house, the chocolate cakes, and my classmates’ half-shocked envy.  but my grandfather went home from the mortuary and for five years tried to share the noises in his skull, then he walked out and lay under a furze-bush to die.  when my father came back from identifying the daughter he asked us to remind him of her mouth. we tried. he said ‘i think it was the one’.  these were marginal people i had met only rarely and the end of the whole household meant that no grief was seen; never have people seemed so absent from their own deaths.  this bloody episode of four whom i could understand better dead gave me something i needed to keep a long story moving; i had no pain of it; can find no scar even now.  but had my belief in the fiction not been thus buoyed up i might, in the sigh and strike of the next night’s bombs have realized a little what they meant, and for the first time been afraid.

 i’ve come to this one grassy hill in ramallah, off tokyo street, to place a few red anemones &amp; a sheaf of wheat on darwish’s grave. a borrowed line transported me beneath a babylonian moon &amp; i found myself lucky to have the shadow of a coat as warmth, listening to a poet’s song of jerusalem, the hum of a red string caesar stole off gilgamesh’s lute. i know a prison of sunlight on the skin. the land i come from they also dreamt before they arrived in towering ships battered by the hard atlantic winds. crows followed me from my home. my coyote heart is an old runagate redskin, a noble savage, still lakota, &amp; i knew the bow before the arch. i feel the wildflowers, all the grasses &amp; insects singing to me. my sacred dead is the dust of restless plains i come from, &amp; i love when it gets into my eyes &amp; mouth telling me of the roads behind &amp; ahead. i go back to broken treaties &amp; smallpox, the irony of barbed wire. your envoy could be a reprobate whose inheritance is no more than a swig of firewater. the sun made a temple of the bones of my tribe. i know a dried-up riverbed &amp; extinct animals live in your nightmares sharp as shark teeth from my mountains strung into this brave necklace around my neck. i hear chief standing bear saying to judge dundy, “i am a man,” &amp; now i know why i’d rather die a poet than a warrior, tattoo &amp; tomahawk.

who saw its fires here rise, and there descend, explain his own beginning, or his end? alas what wonder! man's superior part uncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to art; but when his own great work is but begun, what reason weaves, by passion is undone.  trace science then, with modesty thy guide; first strip off all her equipage of pride; deduct what is but vanity, or dress, or learning's luxury, or idleness; or tricks to show the stretch of human brain, mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain; expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent parts of all our vices have created arts; then see how little the remaining sum, which serv'd the past, and must the times to come!  ii.  two principles in human nature reign; self-love, to urge, and reason, to restrain; nor this a good, nor that a bad we call, each works its end, to move or govern all: and to their proper operation still, ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.  self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul; reason's comparing balance rules the whole. man, but for that, no action could attend, and but for this, were active to no end: fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot, to draw nutrition, propagate, and rot; or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void, destroying others, by himself destroy'd.  most strength the moving principle requires; active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires. sedate and quiet the comparing lies, form'd but to check, delib'rate, and advise. self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh; reason's at distance, and in prospect lie: that sees immediate good by present sense; reason, the future and the consequence. thicker than arguments, temptations throng, at best more watchful this, but that more strong. the action of the stronger to suspend, reason still use, to reason still attend. attention, habit and experience gains; each strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.  let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight, more studious to divide than to unite, and grace and virtue, sense and reason split, with all the rash dexterity of wit: wits, just like fools, at war about a name, have full as oft no meaning, or the same. self-love and reason to one end aspire, pain their aversion, pleasure their desire; but greedy that its object would devour, this taste the honey, and not wound the flow'r: pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood, our greatest evil, or our greatest good.  iii.  modes of self-love the passions we may call: 'tis real good, or seeming, moves them all: but since not every good we can divide, and reason bids us for our own provide; passions, though selfish, if their means be fair, list under reason, and deserve her care; those, that imparted, court a nobler aim, exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.  in lazy apathy let stoics boast their virtue fix'd, 'tis fix'd as in a frost; contracted all, retiring to the breast; but strength of mind is exercise, not rest: the rising tempest puts in act the soul, parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole. on life's vast ocean diversely we sail, reason the card, but passion is the gale; nor god alone in the still calm we find, he mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.  passions, like elements, though born to fight, yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work unite: these 'tis enough to temper and employ; but what composes man, can man destroy? suffice that reason keep to nature's road, subject, compound them, follow her and god. love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train, hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain, these mix'd with art, and to due bounds confin'd, make and maintain the balance of the mind: the lights and shades, whose well accorded strife gives all the strength and colour of our life.  pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes, and when in act they cease, in prospect, rise: present to grasp, and future still to find, the whole employ of body and of mind. all spread their charms, but charm not all alike; on diff'rent senses diff'rent objects strike; hence diff'rent passions more or less inflame, as strong or weak, the organs of the frame; and hence one master passion in the breast, like aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest.  as man, perhaps, the moment of his breath, receives the lurking principle of death; the young disease, that must subdue at length, grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength: so, cast and mingled with his very frame, the mind's disease, its ruling passion came; each vital humour which should feed the whole, soon flows to this, in body and in soul. whatever warms the heart, or fills the head, as the mind opens, and its functions spread, imagination plies her dang'rous art, and pours it all upon the peccant part.  nature its mother, habit is its nurse; wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse; reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r; as heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more sour. we, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway, in this weak queen some fav'rite still obey: ah! if she lend not arms, as well as rules, what can she more than tell us we are fools? teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend, a sharp accuser, but a helpless friend! or from a judge turn pleader, to persuade the choice we make, or justify it made; proud of an easy conquest all along, she but removes weak passions for the strong: so, when small humours gather to a gout, the doctor fancies he has driv'n them out.  yes, nature's road must ever be preferr'd; reason is here no guide, but still a guard: 'tis hers to rectify, not overthrow, and treat this passion more as friend than foe: a mightier pow'r the strong direction sends, and sev'ral men impels to sev'ral ends. like varying winds, by other passions toss'd, this drives them constant to a certain coast. let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please, or (oft more strong than all) the love of ease; through life 'tis followed, ev'n at life's expense; the merchant's toil, the sage's indolence, the monk's humility, the hero's pride, all, all alike, find reason on their side.  th' eternal art educing good from ill, grafts on this passion our best principle: 'tis thus the mercury of man is fix'd, strong grows the virtue with his nature mix'd; the dross cements what else were too refin'd, and in one interest body acts with mind.  as fruits, ungrateful to the planter's care, on savage stocks inserted, learn to bear; the surest virtues thus from passions shoot, wild nature's vigor working at the root. what crops of wit and honesty appear from spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or fear! see anger, zeal and fortitude supply; ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, philosophy; lust, through some certain strainers well refin'd, is gentle love, and charms all womankind; envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave, is emulation in the learn'd or brave; nor virtue, male or female, can we name, but what will grow on pride, or grow on shame.  thus nature gives us (let it check our pride) the virtue nearest to our vice allied: reason the byass turns to good from ill, and nero reigns a titus, if he will. the fiery soul abhorr'd in catiline, in decius charms, in curtius is divine: the same ambition can destroy or save, and make a patriot as it makes a knave.  iv.  this light and darkness in our chaos join'd, what shall divide? the god within the mind.  extremes in nature equal ends produce, in man they join to some mysterious use; though each by turns the other's bound invade, as, in some well-wrought picture, light and shade, and oft so mix, the diff'rence is too nice where ends the virtue, or begins the vice.  fools! who from hence into the notion fall, that vice or virtue there is none at all. if white and black blend, soften, and unite a thousand ways, is there no black or white? ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain; 'tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.  v.  vice is a monster of so frightful mien, as, to be hated, needs but to be seen; yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, we first endure, then pity, then embrace. but where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed: ask where's the north? at york, 'tis on the tweed; in scotland, at the orcades; and there, at greenland, zembla, or the lord knows where: no creature owns it in the first degree, but thinks his neighbour farther gone than he! ev'n those who dwell beneath its very zone, or never feel the rage, or never own; what happier natures shrink at with affright, the hard inhabitant contends is right.  vi.  virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be, few in th' extreme, but all in the degree; the rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise; and ev'n the best, by fits, what they despise. 'tis but by parts we follow good or ill, for, vice or virtue, self directs it still; each individual seeks a sev'ral goal; but heav'n's great view is one, and that the whole: that counterworks each folly and caprice; that disappoints th' effect of ev'ry vice; that, happy frailties to all ranks applied, shame to the virgin, to the matron pride, fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief, to kings presumption, and to crowds belief, that, virtue's ends from vanity can raise, which seeks no int'rest, no reward but praise; and build on wants, and on defects of mind, the joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.  heav'n forming each on other to depend, a master, or a servant, or a friend, bids each on other for assistance call, 'till one man's weakness grows the strength of all. wants, frailties, passions, closer still ally the common int'rest, or endear the tie: to these we owe true friendship, love sincere, each home-felt joy that life inherits here; yet from the same we learn, in its decline, those joys, those loves, those int'rests to resign; taught half by reason, half by mere decay, to welcome death, and calmly pass away.  whate'er the passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf, not one will change his neighbour with himself. the learn'd is happy nature to explore, the fool is happy that he knows no more; the rich is happy in the plenty giv'n, the poor contents him with the care of heav'n. see the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing, the sot a hero, lunatic a king; the starving chemist in his golden views supremely blest, the poet in his muse.  see some strange comfort ev'ry state attend, and pride bestow'd on all, a common friend; see some fit passion ev'ry age supply, hope travels through, nor quits us when we die.  behold the child, by nature's kindly law, pleas'd with a rattle, tickl'd with a straw: some livelier plaything gives his youth delight, a little louder, but as empty quite: scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage, and beads and pray'r books are the toys of age: pleas'd with this bauble still, as that before; 'till tir'd he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er!  meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays those painted clouds that beautify our days; each want of happiness by hope supplied, and each vacuity of sense by pride: these build as fast as knowledge can destroy; in folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy; one prospect lost, another still we gain; and not a vanity is giv'n in vain; ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force divine, the scale to measure others' wants by thine. see! and confess, one comfort still must rise, 'tis this: though man's a fool, yet god is wise.  
NEW POEM
 her neon sign blared two harlem blocks. in aunt grindle’s elite chitterling shop the variegated dinoceras of a jukebox railed and wailed from everlasting to everlasting: come back, baby, come back—i need your gravy. come back, baby, come back—i’m weak and wavy. the talk of the town, i’m skid row bound— and i don’t mean maybe!  (o scholars) this is the ambivalence of classical blues—and the coins came from the blue-devils’ pocket of dipsy muse.  across an alp of chitterlings, pungent as epigrams, doctor obi nkomo the alter ego of the harlem gallery —as a news-waif hallooed, “the desert fox is dead!”— clicked his tongue —a residual habit from the veld— and —stout as a peasant in the bread-and-cheese war— said, “the lie of the artist is the only lie for which a mortal or a god should die.”  because nobody was a nobody to him, when from his thin charcoal lips irony escaped, it was malice toward none. the therapy of his slips by design into primitive objets d’art humanized the patrons of the harlem gallery as much as the masterworks he salvaged from the lethe of the american way in black manhattan. mr. guy delaporte iii cried out before the regents, “mr. curator, what manner of man is this?”  unharassed by the ignis fatuus of a lost job, doctor nkomo clicked throatily and, with a chuckle whispered to me, “it’s not this buckle- head’s right or wrong if he does right or wrong.” like a humming disk came the strophe of a rebel bantu song.  hubris is an evil the greeks (euripides, sophocles, aeschylus) boned and fleshed to wear the mask. pride is the lust- sinewed wench the churchman speaks of first in the table of deadly sins: doctor nkomo’s all hail to man was a vane on the wing to winnow the grain in person, place and thing.  too many (perhaps) of the regents’ corralled hours doctor nkomo and i left gored in bull rings of pros and cons: without a horse-opera god, the ultra dons the matador’s black of the wherefore and the why, or hoists the white flag and lets the red cells in the marrow die.  his idée fixe ebbed and flowed across the dinner table: “absurd life shakes its ass’s ears in cendrars’—not nkomo’s—stable. if, anchored like hooks of a hag-fish to sea weeds and patient as a weaver in haute-lisse tapestry, a rivera or a picasso, with a camel-hair alchemy, paints in fresco-buono the seven panels of a man’s tridimensionality in variforms and varicolors— since virtue has no kelvin scale, since a mother breeds no twins alike, since no man is an escape running wild from self-sown seeds— then, no man, judged by his biosocial identity in toto can be a kiefekil or a tartufe, an iscariot or an iago.”  is philosophy, then, a tittle’s snack? history, a peacock's almanac? he laughed down at me, a kidney without anchorage, and said: “you must see through the millstone, since you’re not like julio sigafoos and me— an ex-savage.”  his ebony forefinger an assagai blade, he mused aloud as the box played in harlem’s juke: “curator of the harlem ghetto, what is a masterpiece? a virgin or a jade, the vis viva of an ape of god, to awaken one, to pleasure one— a way-of-life’s aubade.”  black as cypress lawn, the crag of a woman crabsidled in. the breath of a fraxinella in hot weather, her unlooked-for grin evaporated; then, like a well’s spew of mud and oil and raw gas, she blew her top. dipsy muse slumped like uhlan when his feet failed to prop, his squeal the squeal of a peccary ax-poled in its pen.  the stem and stern of the elite chitterling shop pitched and ditched in the chatter and squawks, in the clatter and guffaws, as a yarmouth yawl yaws when struck by a rogue-elephant sea. scragged beyond the cavernous door, clamorous as a parrot against the rain, dipsy muse’s vanity scrabbled in vain like an anchor along the neck-gorge of a sea-floor. the jukebox railed and wailed: the black widow spider gets rid of her man, gets rid of her daddy as fast as she can. if you fool around, i know what i’ll do— like the black widow spider i’ll get rid of you. a giraffine fellow whose yellow skin mocked the netted pattern of a cantaloupe opened his rawhide pocketbook to sniff of dope a whiff, with a galley curse and an alley gag; then—laughing, choking, brimstoning his spouse, he caved in like ben franklin’s beggarly bag. doctor nkomo sighed: “the nicks and cuts under a stallion’s tail spur him to carry it higher; but the incised horsetail of a man drains the bones of his i-ness drier.”  a black outsider with all his eggs but one in the white man’s basket, he quaffed his beer, stretched his beanpole legs; then —a rubberneck robin hood in a morris dance— readied a hobby with another color for a ride beyond the afrikaner’s stance. “o, romeo,” he said, “o casanova, prithee, what is chivalrous—what, barbaric? (why gnaw one’s thoughts to the bone?) when a cavemen painted a rubric figure of his mate with a gritstone, eros conquered thanatos.”  his eyes glistening dots of an ice plant, he said: “my western friends —with deserts to be turned into green pastures— rent diving bells to get the bends, curfew morals, incubate tsetse flies, stage a barroom brawl of means and ends in a cul-de-sac. (eagles dying of hunger with cocks in their claws!) that rebel jukebox! hear the ghetto’s dark guffaws that defy manhattan’s bible belt! aeons separate my native veld and your peaks of philosophy: i made the trek, curator, on man’s vegetable ivory, in threescore years and ten.”  a whale of a man, i thought,a true, but not a typical, mammal. he absorbs alien ideas as urdu arabic characters.  in a sepulchral corner, i glimpsed a scarlet sister mary on the make, her lips dark and juicy like a half-done t-bone steak.  the giraffine fellow eyed us with a dog-ape look and outed his impatience in a sigh; a single-acting plunger cast the die, “mister,who are you?” his catarrhal eye baited by doctor nkomo’s hair (the silvery gray patina of a japanese alloy), he was but a squeaking cleopatra boy when the reply came like the undershot of a poncelet water wheel:  “obi nkomo, my dear watson; but that is nil, a water stair that meanders to no vessel. if you ask what am i, you dash on rocks the wisdom and the will of solon and solomon. am i a bee drugged on the honey of sophistry? am i a fish from a river jordan, fated to die as soon as it reaches an asphalt sea?”  not a sound came from the yellow giraffine fellow— not a sound from the bowels of this ixion bound to the everlasting revolving ghetto wheel.  nearer the ground than townsend’s solitaire, doctor nkomo raked his hair … his brain … but he did not blink the cliff of ice. “what am i?what are you? perhaps we are twin colors in a crystal. when i was a zulu lad, i heard an old-wives’ tale for seven-foot-spear chakas to be. in a barnyard near a buffalo trail a hunter discovered an eagle eating dung with chickens. he carried the feathered rex to a mountain top, although it raised the dickens. the hunter explained, ‘you're not a chicken, aquila.’ he launched the ungainly bird into space. a fouled umbrella! in the wing lock of habit, it tumbled in disgrace … down … down … down a ghostified cock!  “out of the visaing face of the sun swooped the falcon baron clarioning the summons of an aeried race. twice the barnyard eagle answered the solar city wight; thrice he spiraled the simoom-blistered height— braked and banked and beaked upward, upward, into transfiguring light. old probabilities,what am i? mister,what are you? an eagle or a chicken come home to roost? i wish i knew!”  his character (in the greek sense) phrased a nonplus—needed a metaphor’s translation. as an african prince, kings and chiefs peacocked themselves behind him; and he, himself tough-conscienced, had slain heathenism, the giant grim, without a backward cry. scot and plot, caste and class, rifted right angles to the curving grain.  the dream of abraham’s bosom bottled long ago, he walked the pork barrel’s porphyry street with the man in the ears; and the glassy rivers of talk —heraclitean, fabian, marxian— in the lights and shadows of the illuminating gas, bona fides, limned a figure and cast of homo aethiopicus who knew all riverine traffickers pass beyond the seven walls of water—to join … the last of the greeks … of the romans, the last.  once in a while his apology shaped itself like the symbol q in a skipper’s log. during the falconry in the chamber of the regents, mr. delaporte iii flew off at a tangent and off the handle. doctor nkomo’s dandie dinmount terrier epithet sprang across the tables. my gavel big-talked in slang. like a turtle’s head, the session withdrew into its shell. the old africanist bowed cavalierly and said: “i’ve called the gentleman a liar —it’s true— and i am sorry for it.”  wealth of the fettered, illth of the lettered, left his realism, like rock dust, unweathered: one who eyes the needle of the present to knit the future’s garb. in his own buttoned guise he seemed to speak to the man friday in everyman boned and lined and veined for the twelve great fatigues to the promised land:  “the golden mean of the dark wayfarer’s way between black scylla and white charybdis, i have traveled; subdued ifs in the way; from vile-canaille balconies and nigger heavens, seen day beasts and night beasts of prey in the disemboweling pits of europe and america, in the death-worming bowels of asia and africa; and, although a dumb ox (like young aquinas), i have not forgot the rainbows and the olive leaves against the orient sky.  “the basso profundo gibbon of putney —not the lyric tenor, thomas of celano— hymns the dies irae!”

 1914 the phantoms flit before our dazzled eyes, glory and honour, wrath and righteousness, the agèd phantoms in their bloodstained dress, vultures that fill the world with ravenous cries,  swarming about the rock where, chained apart, in age-long pain prometheus finds no rest from the divine flame burning in his breast, and vultures tearing at a human heart.  not yet the blessed hours on golden wings bring to the crucified their sure relief, deeper and deeper grows the ancient grief, blackest of all intolerable things.  eternal rebel, sad, and old, and blind, bound with a chain enslaved by every one of the dark gods who hide the summer sun, yet art thou still the saviour of mankind.  free soul of fire, break down their chains and bars, drive out those unclean phantoms of the brain, till every living thing be friends again, and our lost earth true comrade to the stars.

 i just had the old dodge in the shop with that same damned front-end problem, and i was out, so to speak, for a test run,  loafing along, maybe 35 m.p.h., down the old corvallis road, holding her out of the ruts and potholes.  that’s out in montana, the bitterroot valley. long ways from home is how they say it. long ways from home, boys, long long ways from home.  might as well not put this clunker in the shop and keep my hard-earned in my pocket, she wobbles and humps like a scared rabbit.  but it’s a real fine summer day in corvallis, and i’m loafing along watching the sprayers do their slow drag on the fields of alfalfa,  and i come to a side road with a little green sign says “kurtz lane” and i said to myself out loud, “mistah kurtz—he alive. him doing just fine,”  because of the sign, you see, and because i’m lonesome and maybe kind of bitter in spite of the sunshine. it’s still a goddamn long ways from home.  that’s one thing, though, that heart of darkness, i read that story every year, i never forget that crazy old son-of-a-bitch, that kurtz.  and the next thing i see about a quarter-mile down the road is somebody small on the shoulder, a kid looking for a ride home, i figure.  and he’s a kid all right, maybe ten or eleven, but no montana boy, he’s an oriental, one of those laotians that got resettled.  can’t figure why they brought them to montana. he’s got those big eyes and caved-in cheeks like the pictures on the tv during vietnam,  and his mouth is open a little. i say to myself, i’ll give him a ride if he wants, and i even begin to slow down, but he didn’t  put up his thumb. just when i went by, he waved, real quick and shy, but still like he was trying to reach me. i drove on. then i bust out crying.

 in the united terminal in chicago at five on a friday afternoon the sky is breaking with rain and wind and all the flights are delayed forever. we will never get to where we are going and there’s no way back to where we’ve been. the sun and the moon have disappeared to an island far from  anywhere.  everybody has a heartache —  the immense gatekeeper of gate z–100 keeps his cool. this guardian of the sky teases me and makes me smile through the mess, building up his airline by stacking it against the company i usually travel: come on over to our side, we’ll treat you nice. i laugh as he hands me back my ticket, then he turns to charm the next customer, his feet tired in his minimum wage shoes.  everybody has a heartache —  the man with his head bobbing to music no one else can hear has that satisfied feel — a full belly of sweet and a wife who sings heartache to sleep. in his luggage (that will be lost and never found) is a musty dream of flying solo to africa, with a stop on the return to let go the stories too difficult to carry home. he’ll take off his shoes to walk in a warm, tropical sea. he’ll sing to the ancestors: take me home to mama. no one cooks like her. but all the mamas worked to the bone gone too young. broken by the man.  everybody has a heartache —  everyone’s mouthing fried, sweet, soft and fat, while we wait for word in the heart of the scrambled beast. the sparkle of soda wets the dream core. that woman over there the color of broth did what she was told. it’s worked out well as can be expected in a world where she was no beauty queen and was never seen, always in the back of someplace in the back — she holds the newest baby. he has croup. shush, shush. go to sleep, my little baby sheepie. he sits up front of her with his new crop of teeth.  everybody has a heartache —  this man speaks to no one, but his body does. half his liver is swollen with anger; the other half is trying to apologize — what a mess i’ve made of history, he thinks without thinking. mother coming through the screen door, her clothes torn, whimpering:it’s okay baby, please don’t cry. don’t cry. baby don’t cry.

 even city planning.  yesterday, for example, with its unexpected view of posterity draped loosely between high-rises — unlike the composed street raised to stoop level like a stroller. no moon but clearly under some pressure to form one in quick stages, while being careful to avoid what intervenes with commas, speech tags, etc. architraves pre-everything.  so that time, or what’s left of it, prior to displaying its secret life (which wasn’t so secret to begin with) waves everyone and everything away, including the burnished sills and their plants lithographed with evening  plus the host of secondary qualities that rush in on the least pretext, a new unit of space, some jazz below, mouths to feed ... wrinkles alchemy prints on studious foreheads. or indeterminacy. what did rimbaud know about ageing anyway?  — more than you think.  leaving (you might say) a colorful flag without a flagpole, the parade route all but painted over like the history of unopposed takeovers  and the real wrinkle is that nothing is there for the taking no matter how it appears. shuffling off to buffalo or wherever they go to fill the intemperate, intermediate needs, while the wisps of grass that inevitably push up between cracks look digital and the buses squeeze their passengers to left and right like shifts in basic economic priorities.  have i mentioned noodling, as opposed to “raptures of attention”? the effect without a cause — unless you’re one of those who find that notion empty of meaning — not only in connection to instrumental music (“i wasn’t playing anything i was just noodling”) but phenomena in general, potential as well as kinetic, from y. zowl singing “to a small guitar” to our near-absorption in textures, weathers, (invasive) ellipses, sublimation, etc.?  to sum up: it’s not that the telegram to elizabeth bishop was  undelivered but that the dead — if not busy licking their wounds — are absorbed with themselves, as we must appear to the perceptive hawks. dark gray, dark green, beet red all over, but also (hence the notion of collateral damage when it applies) thickness tout court.

 merchants have multiplied more than the stars of heaven. half the population are like the long grasshoppers that sleep in the bushes in the cool of the day; the sound of their wings is heard at noon, muffled, near the earth. the crane handler dies; the taxi driver dies, slumped over in his taxi. meanwhile high in the air an executive walks on cool floors, and suddenly falls. dying, he dreams he is lost in a snowbound mountain on which he crashed, carried at night by great machines. as he lies on the wintry slope, cut off and dying, a pine stump talks to him of goethe and jesus. commuters arrive in hartford at dusk like moles or hares flying from a fire behind them, and the dusk in hartford is full of their sighs. their trains come through the air like a dark music, like the sound of horns, the sound of thousands of small wings.

 if  you give money to an animal he or she gets cloying and aggressive but when arrested for that behavior says, “i didn’t know anything, my reps did it. well they did. these humans committed their tiny crimes in the mail,” it says, “knowing animals are photogenic. you can hold one in your lap or hold a sheaf of  photos in which a feline looks like you yourself  tearing off a leg of a springbok antelope, which prey looks like you concentrating on the flee instinct,” it says. i tend to agree with it. it and all of them have expressions on their faces, four limbs, two eyes, noses, ears, etcetera, how close can you get to you or me, and then there’s the same insides. if  it is a cheetah do not put it in your lap. if  it’s a black rhino it weighs 2,250 lbs. and has two! sharp horns about 24 in. ea.! let’s suppose nothing about that one and not say it has a facial expression. my own opinion is it will have one in a matter of time. there are ten other scenes in which i look like the animals in them so don’t argue i’m writing yet another check this week and as a matter of fact i’d like to smack something, bite it, and cook it. you do that, tonight for instance. if one of us eats the other it’s a very big crime not tiny like the revolutionary revelation in a solicitation that we are like the animals, no,are them, which is bigger in evolution and spirituality, sure, and in the final accounting much more important, but today don’t put a cheetah in your lap and don’t eat other humans.

 exuberance sips bootleg gin from a garter flask with a ruby monogram “e.”  she wears a red dress one size too small, eyes wide, she flirts with everyone, dares  lincoln beachey to fly until he runs out of gas, rides a dead engine all the way down.  she watches ormer locklear climb out of the cockpit two hundred feet up,  tap dance on his upper wing as the houses of  honest families  with their square-fenced yards slide below his shuffle. an oval pond  winks in the sun, like a zero. exuberance challenges pilots  to master the falling leaf, perfect the tailspin, ignore the graveyard spiral, the doom loop.  these aviators predict every american will fly. exuberance believes everybody ought  to be rich

 the idiot goes round and around with his brother in a bumping car at the fair. the famous idiot smile hangs over the car’s edge, illuminating nothing. this is mankind being taken for a ride by a rich relation. the responses are fixed: bump, smile; bump, smile. and the current  is generated by the smooth flow of the shillings. this is an orchestra of steel with the constant percussion of laughter. but where he should be laughing too, his features are split open, and look! out of the cracks come warm, human tears.

 somebody who would never refuse money told me this— about the syncretic effect when each person plugs their attention into a field to read ad copy, let’s just say they become opened up and other beings can see into their minds. this was considered a science fiction idea to many people, but not to me. in my negative space construction is always occurring.  the liftoff from awful to tolerable to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful has been my most difficult task to swing. but swing i will; there’s nothing else to do. i live here and being here and hearing myself or my mind’s divide through others convinces me that i must do everything i can to save us from the pit.  that is, until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows. you may have a tree of your own—you may have a home in your own tree. congratulations. if you write an instructive pamphlet you can bet i will read it. i do not want to go out in darkness. i am doing everything i know to prevent this, and thank you, by the way, if you’ve written a pamphlet.  the shared information system and each being at the end of its screen emits an led (light emitting diode) on an often green screen—you say i should give my father up to the authorities. you blame your circumstances on my choice—but it’s the authorities who did this to him. how do you think a person loses his mind? he let someone take it.  he is sort of my mind and you are too, god help me. the green screen is an ingenious discovery. you can record events in a studio before the screen and then key in whatever environment you like. it’s a special color: chroma green, but it can be blue too.  the experience of things is determined by our feelings about them. information is colored by us. you may see remotely, in a photograph for instance, the image of an ambush victim. maybe it is a war and/or she is caught naked. if she is unhappy—indicated by face and body arrangement—you may feel that.  some people will hate the state of things that made her so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it. how do you find her? what guns surround her country? and after all, maybe she would hate it. to have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation. she may only be thinking about humiliation.  that is a tough feeling to shake. then, and i need not go too far into this, then there are those who see the pain of someone and they just love it. this may have something to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound. the wound, they think, is everyone else’s fault and they cannot forgive. this is only information, in the form of speculation.  some feelings you get when you consider “what if this happened to me?” and you will want to remedy the situation to secure yourself from the (negative) condition of it. together, humans create one body—the planet earth and its projections. the things in the stomach affect what goes on in the head. on the web many people make money with miracle potions.  some curb the human appetite. some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want. i heard the other girl refer to me as a skull. she was very angry and did not look or say hello. there is a prevalent competitive notion that each only has one place. that her face is only hers and that i don’t have a face or to her it is death.  this she reads as me—the death of her. obviously i am not. i write and read and then roll on. i wear an ordinary human face, some could compare me to a bird of prey because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long and i like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back. i am not here to attack.  you are also a mutant. do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you? do you think you can go to sleep here and wake up the same? the screen is framed by plastic, beneath that you use words to issue commandments or call-outs.  most people use the web to send messages to people who are already their friends. they make arrangements for later and detail what happened in the past. this information may be not true. the web cannot know intention. it records and is open to influence.  people make money through advertisements, or so they think—well, selling ads, that’s quantifiable— if ads make money, that is more difficult to know unless there are special offers. the web is full of special offers and 30-day trials. if you fall for those, or i should say, if you respond to the offer  what often happens is that your information is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox with offers (that which is known as spam). because you are someone who wants to look great and there are other companies with products compatible with your stated desire. ways for you to achieve the prevailing notion of beauty.  it is my job to tell you the models are selected because they are physically improbable. they are elevated to be made desirable. their desirability is physical because they are models. if it were easy to be like that, they would not be sought-after by manufacturers. generally, working people need to be sturdy.  advertisers want to make money. they go with psychology and so create a sort of self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people. they know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form no matter what station they are from. everyone wants to be beautiful. everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing.  probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside if not outside. you can create an excellent argument for your being and improve upon ability. that is my opinion. if you live alone, you may know how great the web can be. on it there is information and pornography. information includes the prospects.  pornography is the biggest industry in america. it is designed to bring about a certain state of arousal, generally, couched in anger that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to without worrying about the one fucked. pornography is addictive for many. of course, sometimes people want to touch, to hear a voice  to imagine a partner and what they can do together. the web has many dating services. my ex-psychiatrist advised me against trying them. she had transferred the daughter role onto me. i do appreciate the dangers of strangers. i am prepared with the information that pictures are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways.  i know at least three people who have been in love with people they met online. each one is intelligent and down-to-earth. i’ve gleaned from their descriptions of online courting that the early questions are essential. that and no expectation and somehow you have to withhold your own personal information.  that is, until you meet up in a non-threatening place. you will have to have someone know where you are, a point person. and you will need a defense; mace, for instance or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby or in the car. it will be important for him or her to know you have a dog. they should meet each other as soon as possible.  this is the magic of the machine. the meeting and love trial and, if it works, the love made. well, that really is amazing. objectively amazing. and good for the machine. good for the machine.  the electric web courses heavily through me. this may be how we make history: we can put up our movies, our words, or costume dramas. we say we are so and so and people follow the saga. do you ever get the problem which is opposite to the problem of the watcher?  have you ever only seen yourself through other people? or thought that’s what it was but it was really your thought processes transferred through them? i should look up the word rubric again. that and lacuna and devi. in the thrift store nobody looked at me. but the woman said, “devi (hee, hee) devi.”  a celestial being: what we all are. true she might have meant devil. i am not a devil. i love my friends most of the time. i love animals—i don’t think devils do that. my friend sends me pictures of jackrabbits and frogs.  yesterday, he said he saw buttercups, a type of flower. you go over the tracks first, on the other side of the river  and there they are.

 in the years to come they will say, “they fell like the leaves in the autumn of nineteen thirty-nine.” november has come to the forest, to the meadows where we picked the cyclamen. the year fades with the white frost on the brown sedge in the hazy meadows, where the deer tracks were black in the morning. ice forms in the shadows; disheveled maples hang over the water; deep gold sunlight glistens on the shrunken stream. somnolent trout move through pillars of brown and gold. the yellow maple leaves eddy above them, the glittering leaves of the cottonwood, the olive, velvety alder leaves, the scarlet dogwood leaves, most poignant of all.  in the afternoon thin blades of cloud move over the mountains; the storm clouds follow them; fine rain falls without wind. the forest is filled with wet resonant silence. when the rain pauses the clouds cling to the cliffs and the waterfalls. in the evening the wind changes; snow falls in the sunset. we stand in the snowy twilight and watch the moon rise in a breach of cloud. between the black pines lie narrow bands of moonlight, glimmering with floating snow. an owl cries in the sifting darkness. the moon has a sheen like a glacier.

NEW POEM
 those who have lived here since before time are gone while the ones who must replace them have not yet arrived.  the streets are wet with a recent rain yet you continue to count first minutes and hours then trees  rocks, windows, mailboxes, streetlights and pictographs refusing to rest even for the brief span it  would take to dry off, change clothes and reemerge grotesque yet oddly attractive like paganini  whose mother was visited by a seraph in genoa not long before his birth and who is  thought now to have acquired much of his technical wizardry as a result of marfan’s syndrome  a quite common anomaly of the connective tissues which may well account for the tall and  angular body, muscular underdevelopment as well as the hypermobile joints that  eventuated on the stage in a peculiar stance, a spectacular bowing technique  and an awesome mastery of the fingerboard. he would bring his left hip forward to support his  body’s weight. his left shoulder, thrust forward also, would enable him to rest his left elbow on  his chest, a buttress against the stress of forceful bowing along with debilitating muscle  fatigue. the looseness of the right wrist and shoulder gave pliancy leading to broad acrobatic  bowing. the ‘spider’ fingers of his left hand permitted a range on the fingerboard which many  attributed to black magic for paganini was said to have signed a pact with lucifer  to acquire virtuosity as a small child. after his death perhaps due in part to this tale  in part also to rumours of gambling and wild debauchery the church refused to allow him  burial on hallowed ground. in consequence his body was moved furtively from place to place  until after many years and for reasons still mysterious the church finally relented.  a few paradoxes should be noted as an afterward. though accused of charlatanism he  was rewarded for his skill like no one before him. he loved his violin above all yet once  he gambled it away at cards. he accepted wealth and renown from his worshipping admirers  but tripled the admission price to his concerts in the face of adverse reviews. while openly  irreverent of tradition he still took a princess as his lover and let nations strike medals in his name.

 the city and the continent trail off into cold black water the same way: at the western edge, a flat stretch with precipitous planes set perpendicular and back from the beach or beach-equivalent, a blacktop margin where the drugged and dying trudge, queue up for hades. bolinas had its junkie lady with gray skin, gray sweater, stumbling through the sand with the short- burst intensity and long-run aimlessness of crackhead hustlers on the west street piers. dreams of bolinas haunted me for years before i saw it. i’d huddle at the foot of the cliff in a cold wind late at night, wrapped in indian blankets, waiting with strangers as the tidal wave or temblor hit. tonight i walk with old friends in a new dream past a vest-pocket park of great formality and charm in the far west village. my disaffected former confidant has grown a pony tail and cruises up the street on a “hog,” a “chopper,” which seems a perfect locomotive choice. i walk out to the quay where gondola after enormous gondola departs for “the other side,” not new jersey anymore, anymore than something prosaic as another mass of land past the bright horizon could function as a mirror of the chopped-away bolinas hill. o western edge, where points of interest on maps of individual hearts and bodies disappear in waters of a depth unfathomable even in a dream, i had thought that sleep was meant to blunt your sharpness, not to hone and polish with the lapping of the hungry waves of lethe.

 several of my cousins lean up against the house, taking long drags from the pack of marlboros we share. we have always been this way —addicted and generous. a pow wow tape plays from inside the open garage where two old uncles are thinking to themselves in the safety of its shadows. our aunties are in the kitchen, preparing the boiled meat and chokecherry soup and laughing about old jokes they still hang onto because these things are a matter of survival. outside, we ask about who was driving around with who last night, where so-and-so got beat up, whose girlfriend left him for someone else. (but she’ll go back to him, we all think to ourselves.) aunties carry the full pots and pans to the picnic table, an uncle prays over our food in assiniboine. we all want to forget that we don’t understand this language, we spend lots of time trying to forget in different ways. no one notices that the wild turnips are still simmering in a pot on the stove.

 1.  the flat end of sorrow here two crows fighting over new year's party leftovers. from my cell, i see a cold hard world.   2.  so this is the abscess that hurts the nation— jails, torture, blood and hunger. one day it will burst; it must burst.   3.  when i heard you were taken we speculated, those of us at large where you would be in what nightmare will you star? that night i heard the moans wondering whose child could now be lost in the cellars of oppression. then you emerged, tall, and bloody-eyed.  it was the first time i wept.   4.  the long nights i dread most the voices from behind the bars the early glow of dawn before the guard's steps wake me up, the desire to leap and stretch and yawn in anticipation of another dark home-coming day only to find that i cannot. riding the car into town, hemmed in between them their guns poking me in the ribs, i never had known that my people wore such sad faces, so sad they were, on new year's eve, so very sad.

 stripped in a flamedance, the bluff backing our houses quivered in wet-black skin. a shawl of haze tugged tight around the starkness. we could have choked on august.  smoke thick in our throats, nearly naked as the earth, we played bare feet over the heat caught in asphalt. could we, green girls, have prepared for this? yesterday,  we played in sand-carpeted caves. the store we built sold broken bits of ice plant, empty snail shells, leaves. our school’s walls were open sky. we reeled in wonder  from the hills, oblivious to the beckoning crescendo and to our parent’s hushed communion. when our bluff swayed into the undulation, we ran  into the still streets of our suburb, feet burning against a fury that we did not know was change.

 whose bread, buttered on the side of the angels,  falls from a great height? so you wait to take the temperature of your enslavement:  is it slow-growing, like a virus, or magnanimous and complete? your interlocutors are generous, the little stretching rack is cute,  and all grown over, like an english cottage, with tiny, exhibitionistic roses.  will they open wide enough for you? this is a song about paralysis,  despite your sweet mouth running all that rivulet  of chatter, despite the fan dance with the missing lampshade bobbing on your head,  the children and their panic-stricken laughter.

 one lies in rags on the street and his stomach is empty and he wishes for death  one sits with friends at tea and backgammon and his mind is empty and he wishes for death  one sits in a straight-backed chair at a desk and his bank account is empty and he wishes for death  one lies in bed staring out to sea and the place next to him in bed is empty and he wishes for death  one flies back with food in its beak and its nest is empty and only this one says we should give it another try

 i call to ask my mother the name of the street where we bought the suitcases when we left brooklyn. a better question would have been how did it feel to be sliced from the rib of pine and loring and sent, like a kite, up north. or tell me what your mother said to you in her grand rear room the night we left, seated on the edge of her bed in her nightgown, muted in the low light. so many bellies in the house. cacophony of kreyol and brooklyn buk and sweet sweat across the walls. did she tell you to follow your husband. did she tell you anything about us. how, above all, you should keep us anchored to here, where the distance between comfort and safety is measurable by the length of the hallway, the distance from one room to the next. the rooms, like capsules, each with its own medicine for black kids. or, tell me what you wore on the plane ride. i only remember what i wore: stockings and mary janes and the pink knit pleated skirt. i did not remember this was your first time flying, a grown woman over thirty, and you had never seen how small the world looked beneath your feet.

 that day i hired a private detective to follow me, and could not read his notes. in a tangled grove, i hid behind white pines, compressed my body, then watched him write, left-handed and myopic, under an irish cap, when i asked for help from strangers who spoke slavic languages. wary, moving ahead, i found a depot, watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam, and boarded, second class. i had no ticket, and my expired passport represented a drooping head with unfamiliar eyes. unshaken, rows behind, the stranger waited, wielding camera and pen. across the border i disembarked, but knew he would capture me, with soundless footsteps, even on black gravel.  i tried to recall my crime. i know i am guilty, but never why. lawless, i have ignored those signs: wrong way ; go back and no way out , circles that tell me you are here . i gather it is the whispers that explode, the looks that make dogs whimper. when i bow in prayer i think of love; i know i’ve killed my friends, pelting them with a touch—and yet i’ve heard they are alive. besides, that’s not the real  offense. i would cross any path, or trek through swamps to find my crime. but even he, that bald, insistent man who follows me, unsleeping, cannot tell me what i’ve done.

 a species of tiny human has been discovered, which lived on the remote indonesian island of flores just 18,000 years ago. . . . researchers have so far unearthed remains from eight individuals who were just one metre tall, with grapefruit-sized skulls. these astonishing little people . . . made tools, hunted tiny elephants and lived at the same time as modern humans who were colonizing the area. —nature, october 2004 light: lifted, i stretch my brief body. color: blaze of day behind blank eyes.  sound: birds stab greedy beaks into trunk and seed, spill husk  onto the heap where my dreaming and my loving live.  every day i wake to this.  tracks follow the heavy beasts back to where they huddle, herd.  hunt: a dance against hunger. music: feast and fear.  this island becomes us.  trees cap our sky. it rustles with delight in a voice green as lust. reptiles  drag night from their tails, live by the dark. a rage of waves  protects the horizon, which we would devour. one day i want to dive in and drift,  legs and arms wracked with danger. like a dark star. i want to last.

 i lay back on the carpeted bottom step of the stairwell that like a well extended darkly up to the window near the ceiling,  up where the chinaman under the wide-brimmed hat that hid his face pulled the flowerpot that held no flower across the sill no one could reach.  there was a television on somewhere above me, and the doomsday clock was ticking, someone was saying. someone was saying something  about a blockade and a quarantine, who would blink first, lose face, or push the button. a fat man banged a shoe against a desk.  the chinaman however didn’t care. pulling his flowerpot of absent flowers, he was content to be a clot of darkness  brightening the moment late sun caught the glass— the hat tip first, and then the hat, the arms, the rickshaw of the flowerpot he pulled.  and everywhere within the light’s slow fall infinities of particles were falling into the flowerpot they’d never fill.

 the old south boston aquarium stands in a sahara of snow now. its broken windows are boarded. the bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales. the airy tanks are dry.  once my nose crawled like a snail on the glass; my hand tingled to burst the bubbles drifting from the noses of the cowed, compliant fish.  my hand draws back. i often sigh still for the dark downward and vegetating kingdom of the fish and reptile. one morning last march, i pressed against the new barbed and galvanized  fence on the boston common. behind their cage, yellow dinosaur steamshovels were grunting as they cropped up tons of mush and grass to gouge their underworld garage.  parking spaces luxuriate like civic sandpiles in the heart of boston. a girdle of orange, puritan-pumpkin colored girders braces the tingling statehouse,  shaking over the excavations, as it faces colonel shaw and his bell-cheeked negro infantry on st. gaudens' shaking civil war relief, propped by a plank splint against the garage's earthquake.  two months after marching through boston, half the regiment was dead; at the dedication, william james could almost hear the bronze negroes breathe.  their monument sticks like a fishbone in the city's throat. its colonel is as lean as a compass-needle.  he has an angry wrenlike vigilance, a greyhound's gentle tautness; he seems to wince at pleasure, and suffocate for privacy.  he is out of bounds now. he rejoices in man's lovely, peculiar power to choose life and die— when he leads his black soldiers to death, he cannot bend his back.  on a thousand small town new england greens, the old white churches hold their air of sparse, sincere rebellion; frayed flags quilt the graveyards of the grand army of the republic.  the stone statues of the abstract union soldier grow slimmer and younger each year— wasp-waisted, they doze over muskets and muse through their sideburns . . .  shaw's father wanted no monument except the ditch, where his son's body was thrown and lost with his "niggers."  the ditch is nearer. there are no statues for the last war here; on boylston street, a commercial photograph shows hiroshima boiling  over a mosler safe, the "rock of ages" that survived the blast. space is nearer. when i crouch to my television set, the drained faces of negro school-children rise like balloons.  colonel shaw is riding on his bubble, he waits for the blessèd break.  the aquarium is gone. everywhere, giant finned cars nose forward like fish; a savage servility slides by on grease.

 for a flag! i answered facetiously. a flag of tomorrow, fluent in fire, not just the whispers, lisps, not just the still there of powdered wigs, dry winds. who wants a speckled drape that folds as easy over smirch as fallen soldier? this is rhetorical. like, "what to the negro is the fourth of july?" a flag should be stitched with a fuse.  jefferson said for each generation a flag. maybe he said constitution. i once raised a high-top flag of my hair, a fist, a leather medallion of the motherland. i studied heraldry and maniples (which are not what you might guess), little sails and banners down to the vane of a feather. because his kids were rebel cities my father loved like sherman. because i wanted history i could touch like the flank of a beast.  my wife's people are from san salvador. they sent us with a guard, his ak shouldered like a mandolin, among anil-tinted shawls and jerseys, across tiled and pocked concrete, and the gated stalls of el centra. i felt sacred as a goat there, too, as i did below the mason-dixon where our only protection was the fourteenth amendment.  afraid our yankee plates would be read aggressive as a jolly roger we rented a compact in atlanta. charleston, savannah, montgomery, and after birmingham we were broke. skipped selma. slept at b&amp;bs where my dreams power- washed layers of footnotes and februaries, revealing the surreal sheen of apollo creed's trunks, the apocalyptic americana of jacko moonwalking around a tinfoil buzz aldrin planting the corporate ensign. years passed. i grew  youthless in my dad-pants, but still puffed at pinwheels and windsocks, launched glyphs of grillsmoke and one day it came to me, as if commissioned, theaster gates's flag from old fire hoses, a couple dozen, like vertical blinds, no, like cabin floorboards of canvas colored rusty, brick dust, some cheerless drab-and-custard, beside a medley of vespertine blues, hoses evoking landscapes of sackcloth and gunny, texture of violence and tongues inflamed by shine, holy ghost.  ross, duchamp, johns, et al., are integrated here with officers of the peace, their dogs, and, in evidence, their pretend tumescence gates has hung to cure like pelts or strips of jerky.  how did it feel to shield spirit with flesh? i mean, what did it do to the body, water furry as the arm of an arctic bear? what thirst did it ignite?  gates's salute is a torch song, a rhythm of hues marching over a pentimento of rhyme. i approve its message, its pledge to birth a nation of belonging and to teach that nation of the fire shut up in our bones.

 today i left groceries by the playground on hudson and tried to haul, up toward my block, a cross section of a maple grown too large, chainsawed into manhole covers. alphonso, super for all buildings east of the projects, stopped sweeping. he leaned his bald broom against the stoop, nudged the wood with his toe. “nothing to do but roll it,” he said, hands deep in his pockets. i nodded, barely believing my luck in the midst of asphalt, transistor radios, and the wet smell of dogs as he squatted eye level with the log, heaved it against his shoulder like a man who bears a handmade cross for miles on his pentitent back. i saw a kind of glory in his eyes, he understood the heft of the trunk, nicks in the damp bark. i stood on the side and righted the thing and together we rolled this boulder of tree past the indian deli, the russian shoe repair, the caribbean bakery. “you can smell the forest,” he said, as we reached my stoop, wood in the crook of his neck, sawdust and humus and sweat. and we hoisted the thing, one step at a time, stopping only to breathe the scent of sap and after a good half hour it was filling the whole of my apartment— the shade, the damp smell, that enormous presence— light brown rings so perfect my whole life fell right down inside them, concentric circles, tree within tree, the single slab a world within itself— suddenly it was thirty-five years ago: i stood on the edge of a forest, someplace upstate, and looked up into the branches of my first true and majestic tree, in the first real forest—trees instead of buildings. oh the breadth of those limbs— after the taut geometry of elevator, fire escape, lobby, to see through branches to the sun—i believed the world was mine, there was sap in my veins, the tree was limitless, the scent of the tree, the bark and the branch and the six-year-old sightline, which goes on to the edge of the known world.

 from the weathered boards knots pop like the eyes of potatoes. from brick salients not a clink of a pupil in a loop- hole. cannon, yes, but without their kick.  ironically or entirely appropriately, who can say, the fort will not admit us. the reenactors are going home; we see them retreat, backs x’d with sus-  penders, toward the forest housecleaned into state park. ocean beyond the ramparts suggests that stem-celled seconds fiend- ishly agglomerate with fits and starts  into unprecedented forms. and so who cares that a fort’s built on a sand bar, that we don’t make it in, and go only so far round the perimeter.

 i. blood  we wondered if the rumors got to her. i’d seen her with that other girl behind the stop and shop when i was walking home from school one day. i swear, the two of them were kissing, plain as that, the grass so high it brushed their cheeks. i told my teacher so, and maybe it was her who called their folks. before too long, it was like everyone in town had heard. we waited for them at the dime store once, where cedric grabbed her tits and said i’ll learn you how to love how god intended it, you ugly fucking dyke. thing was, she wasn’t ugly like you’d think. she had a certain quality, a shyness maybe, and i’d describe the way she laughed as kind of gentle. anyway, we never saw her with that girl again. they say she got depressed— shit, at the service all of us got tearful. i got to thinking what an awful sight it was, all that red blood—it wasn’t in the papers, but i heard melissa’s mother, who was the nurse in the emergency that night, say how she was just covered up in blood. i can’t think how you bring yourself to cut your throat like that yourself—i asked the counselor they called in to the school, and she said something like,what better ink to write the language of the heart? i guess it proves that stuff from bible school they say, that such a life of sin breeds misery.     ii. phlegm  “my brain is draining from my head,” he said as once again he blew his nose. the clock read 3 a.m.;  its second hand swept slowly through another viscous minute. dead to even nurses sticking them  for new ivs, the other ones slept off their benders soundlessly. “i’m losing my intelligence,”  he said, and blew. my patience waned. he thought he was the president: dementia, ks, hiv  were printed in his problem list. “and plus, i’m getting feverish.” i can’t recall his name, but i  remember hating him—grim wish that he would hurry up and die. just then, he took my hand, and kissed  the back of it as though i were a princess in his foreign land. “my lady, you are beautiful,”  he said, and coughed again. unsure of what to say, my own throat burned. he said, “you can’t know what i feel.”     iii. bile  a gun went off and killed a little girl the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer. i walked through central park; a black dog snarled at squirrels chattering like they had answers.  the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i dreamed of killing someone with a knife. the squirrels, chattering, had likely answers to all my angry questions about life—  a homeboy threatened someone with a knife not far from where a cop showed off his gun, an angry answer to most questions about life. i watched the squirrels hop, the yuppies run;  the cop approached the black kids with his gun. i wondered how much longer she would live; the squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran. i wondered if she’d ever been in love,  i wondered who would pray for her to live, forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses. i wondered why it hurt to fall in love. the cop tried aiming past me, towards the woods.  forgive us for our anger, for our weaknesses: through central park, past the black dog’s snarls, the cop gave chase. a skirmish in the woods. the gun went off—no! shrieked a little girl.     iv. melancholy  we picked at it with sticks at first, until an older kid named samuel arrived. he dropped a heavy rock right on its skull; we watched as thick black slime began to ooze from somewhere just below its heart—or where we thought its heart should be. “raccoon,” said someone solemnly. the landscaper— sweat gleaming, like the polished figurines my mother wouldn’t ever let me touch— regarded us with keen suspicion from across the street. we learned what it could teach; like any body’s secrets, the sublime receded toward the fact of death. i knew both sadness, and disgust in love’s untruths.

 the neighborhood cringes behind windows washed in magnesium light, streamers fizzling above the shingled rooftop of the apartments across the street where teenaged boys with mannish arms throw cherry bombs, bottle rockets, wings and spinners, snappers, chasers, fiery cryolite wheels onto the avenue. paint flakes off the flammable houses and onto brave square plots of white grass. rain-deprived vines sucker the shutters. backyard dogs tear at the dirt, cats run flat out, their tails straight up. what's liberty to the checkout girl selling smokes and nuts, greenbacks turning her fingers to grease? the boys insist on pursuing happiness, their birthright: a box of matches, crackers on strings, sparklers, fountains, missiles, repeating shells, roman candles, brazilian barrages. we peek through blind slats to where they stand around a manhole cover, the gold foam of corona bottles breaking at their feet, young up-turned faces lit by large caliber multi-shot aerials. we suffer each concussion, the sulfer rush that smells like fear, each dizzy, orgiastic display that says we love this country, democracy, the right to a speedy trial. we're afraid to complain, to cross the spent red casings melted on asphalt in the morning's stunned aftermath, to knock hard on any door, and find them draped like dead men over the couches, the floor, hands clasped behind their heads prison style, shoulders tattooed, dreaming the dreams of free men in summer, shirts off, holes in their jeans.

 i strayed about the deck, an hour, to-night under a cloudy moonless sky; and peeped in at the windows, watched my friends at table, or playing cards, or standing in the doorway, or coming out into the darkness. still no one could see me.  i would have thought of them —heedless, within a week of battle—in pity, pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness and link’d beauty of bodies, and pity that this gay machine of splendour ’ld soon be broken, thought little of, pashed, scattered. …  only, always, i could but see them—against the lamplight—pass like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass, slight bubbles, fainter than the wave’s faint light, that broke to phosphorus out in the night, perishing things and strange ghosts—soon to die to other ghosts—this one, or that, or i.

 when it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautiful and terrible thing, needful to man as air, usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all, when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole, reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is more than the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians: this man, this douglass, this former slave, this negro beaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a world where none is lonely, none hunted, alien, this man, superb in love and logic, this man shall be remembered. oh, not with statues’ rhetoric, not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone, but with the lives grown out of his life, the lives fleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.

 it is generally believed that the writers had to make the most of a low budget and that this led to the grim determination of writing through restriction, bottle episodes, and constraints. in reality the show was generously bankrolled by thud, but several costly set pieces had been planned which depleted the kitty. nevertheless, episode 4, comprising solely an intimate kitchen dialogue between fr. k and adah, remains a fan favorite. “it was one of the last things we shot,” recalls halberg. “kitty [beaulieu, who plays adah], had really got into the role by then which was important as we wanted to imply years of previous talk between them. they mics and i got every line so most completely gives the scene personal you’re overhear- neighbors wall.” adah find that in the she has been no longer has and privileges a cleric. to be be excessively alcohol which points out, for father k’s within their probes further. to fob her off both had contact them to whisper that it was al- inaudible. it that indecently atmosphere, as if ing your own through the is dismayed to three months away, father k the obligations to function as bibulous is to fond of drinking is, as adah hardly unusual line of work culture. she father k tries by talking about — tell me again how you were defrocked. — overnight. — that’s half. — bibulously. — that’s hardly uncharacteristic. — alright. there are things we don’t fathom: the “noumenon.” — that’s better. humor me. — march 5th, the hour of botheration: the invertebrates trashed the transept, uprooted the     boutonniere ... this     vermivorous, backhanded ordination... — wood! — bonded, drowned hobo. — oh, eden! oh, heeded ode! — and faith? —n- no, th- th... h- h- h- h- h- h- h- —you’re crying. why? — it’s all that’s left. kantian philosophy (the noumenon is a posited thing, object, or event which is known, if it is known at all, without the use of the senses), but it soon emerges that a violent overthrow of the church has taken place, the transept vandalized, father k (and, we suppose, his ilk) booted out and replaced by patsies during the hour of botheration. its having been titled shows that the recent event has already passed into myth — a further indication that there is no planned resistance. this augurs very ill, and the look on adah’s face as father k sobs in her lap really says it all. she realizes that she will have to act as leader, as cheerleader, as mother, as father to the household.

 one of halberg’s more whimsical decisions: just when the action is coming to a head, attempt to pull off something formally innovative. “underwritten? lithe!” could have been a note to his detractors in this metaphorical on-screen corrections list. each one of its 23 scenes was followed by a “what really happened” reveal, until the audience ran out even of false hope. “it was a bold decision, and by bold i mean stupid,” says ingram. “i tried to reason with him: if you go to pull the rug out from under somebody’s feet 23 times they’re just go- and step off the he had that kind trick in mind the table cloth cutlery, crockery, undisturbed. over and over until the very smashes hell.” the whole an unrealized them share a captors and k, and cain are together as the ing to get bored rug. but i think of conjuring where you pull out and leave the and glassware only you do it again 22 times last tablecloth everything to episode was sneeze. we see joke with their adah, father allowed to stay sun rises. but erratum:  for blubber, read brother. compassion; shoeshine. authoritative; whiten. hard; daft. veldt; thought. inertia; in- herit. mothered; afterthought. work; ho ho ho. schoolteacher; orthodontist. enlightened; muddy. horny; hyphen- ated. underwritten; lithe. theft; fuddle. honorable; anaesthetist. handbag; ow. thud; ahhhhh. huh?; entertainment. sainthood; elf. revolution; neology. dad; backbencher. bosom; overstay. watchmen; wretches. hydrate; shoot. no, we jump-cut to their separation and father k weeps hoarsely as their hands are tied behind their backs. after an inappropriate remark about adah, cain kicks an ak-47 from the weaker-looking patrolman’s skinny arms and scatters the rest in a hail of bullets. but no, we jump-cut to cain being repeatedly pistol- whipped by the same patrolman. it seems unnecessary to list the others. this is now a world where honor is an anaesthetic and the saint is as fictional as the elf. they beg for water. cain takes a bullet to the knee.

 how is it that you live, and what is it you do?  — william wordsworth, to the leech-gatherer three, no, four, that i know, married women of means and brains. one grew moss on her tongue, waking from dreams that smelled of mildew or hoary socks on a smothering train. one turned to falconry and the construction of seed bombs to be dropped from three- story houses. one burned her burka upon being released from prison for the fourth time shamed so down deep in her molested self, washed henceforth in formal darkness, another burned her wedding dress in a fire pot while house finches splashed in the birdbath. [howone momenttouches on another moment and a thought flickers on and off] one poet, obsessed with vulvae, son of a butcher, displayed a large bezoar on his coffee table, and slept in the bear nests in the d’ardèche, obsessed. one poet, adopted shortly after birth by a levee builder on the st. francis, shot himself with a target pistol on a beautiful afternoon in early june. one lay across the tracks on the brink of the tiananmen uprising. one picked up her manuscript, a block of ash, from the embers of her oakland home. bakhtin, as we know, smoked his very best pages in prison. the poems of radnóti were found by his widow in his overcoat, in a mass grave. one scribbled until his last conscious breath in an apartment in waltham, brimmed over with hellish fury and dysfunctional passion. one was imprisoned on a ship in valparaiso during the military coup, but lived with his “iron bad health” to carve a poem 3.5 kilometers long in the atacama desert, and another in the skies over brooklyn; to cover thousands of pages with anguish and light. one is fascinated with lichens and other symbionts. one with fungi and other entheogens. [howthe divine is elusive and pelf is conspicuous] one spent the better part of this life writing in the dirt with a stick, crossing out with his foot, that his entire tribe could decipher the mystery inscribed. [another surrendered hisyouth and gladness with lines of despondency and madness.] one broke faith with the word before the word could break faith with her, and built a mountain of detergent in her garage. one made a record of night-flying birds on a scroll longer than the roll of post-katrina homicides in orleans parish. one does not like white flowers and has never shown her poems to a single solitary living soul. another built a pair of metal wings to be worn once and then pressed between the covers of a golden book. one joined the int’l concatenated order of the hoo-hoo but absconded for europe where he lives large as an unaffiliated psychedelic narcissist. some just want the big life. others suffer into the night at the thought of what they should have said,un autre esprit d’escalier. one was able to buy his first car after a settlement from being bit by a pit bull. one resolved to trim her hair once she began to sit upon it. one walked alone from savannah to santa monica. the perfect time to read the bible and gravity’s rainbow. one posed under a tortuosa beech at arnold arboretum when her picture was taken; wrote longhand crossing the gulf, got a job statuing in new orleans. one of the venerated continues to write though his sight has abandoned him and his garden is returning to wilderness. one snores and never locks her doors. one has lamellar ichthyosis and did not shed her collodion membrane. rare relief springs from poetry and lying flat, cloud-searching on the grass.

 (skellig michael) does not belong to any world that you and i have lived and worked in: it is part of our dream world…then (heading back) we were pursued by terrors, ghost from michael… george bernard shaw i  the ferry furrows the foam, leaving a wake that quickly settles and forgets us, as it has forgotten all those who’ve opened these waters: fisherman, monk, pilgrim and pagan, some foundering here. our mainland world diminishes. there is respite. a cloud engulfs us out of nowhere as if the miraculous were about to appear. the veil lifts to reveal the small skellig and skellig michael rising like chapel and cathedral.  ii  we forget speech, hypnotized by the climb, concentrating on narrow, rock-hewn steps that spiral up like the gyres of the book of kells, whirling in labyrinths of knowledge, turmoil and eternity. they lead to the beehive huts and oratories packed with a congregation of sightseers who whisper in disbelief and reverence at how those sometime monks lived in this wind-tugged cloister of shells.  we browse in each dome’s live absence and picnic above the graveyard that’s no bigger than a currach with a crucifix for helmsman navigating his crew to the island of the dead. we’re eyed by the staunch, monkish puffins. our tongues loosen, but, in keeping with the somberness of this sun-haloed place, we chat about the world with an earnestness that would embarrass us on the mainland.  you tell of medieval monks charting world maps with countries drawn as humans gorging upon each other’s entangled bodies. we go on to the lands and demons of the world of poetry. i’m flummoxed when you ask what poetry is. i recall how the earliest musical instruments were hewn out of bones, and that poets carve their words out of those gone before. they are the primitive musicians who beat and blow words back to life. more than that i don’t know.  iii  […]  that dusk at dún an óir we slaughtered even the pregnant, whimpering women methodically while a bloodstained sun drowned in the ocean. each fetus struggled in the belly of each slain mother as desperately as a lobster dropped in a boiling pot. had shed blood been ink, i could still be quilling the faerie queene, but i did not allow a drop to blot a mere sonnet that you, trapped in complicity, can never quite break free of. admit it, hypocrite! in your time few are not guilty of slaughter. even the page you’ll pen this upon is of pine that amazonians were shot for. i could go on.  (edmund spenser) i lifted the pitch of my grief above the storm-lashing waves for my world breaking on the reefs of foreign, land-grabbing knaves,  who ignore dependence upon the lowliest plants and creatures as the hermit crab and cloak anemone depend on one another.  but no matter what, you must keen for the world’s theft as i keened mine, despite knowing soon no one may be left.  (aodhagán ó rathaille)  lend an ear to one of your own kind and do not let yourself be caught by the winds of lust, like dante’s starlings blown this way and that by every gust.  i myself was borne on this wind as i rode across country, always wary that around the next bend my life would catch up with me.  my rakish ways squandered energy that i should have instilled in song, more worthy of the muse-gift given to me than my odd aisling,  pay particular heed to me, especially since your word-talent is less than mine. i’m still too bushed to eke out a last line. (eoghan rua ó súilleabháin)  sing up front, cold-shouldering the fashionable low key of your time, closed, cautious and crabbit as a farmer.  sing as open-throated as my curlew keen. i supped the red wine of art’s blood as he lay slain, already becoming cork mud.  sing as full-throated as my unmatched plaint; matching my words to his cold body that would never again rouse to my touch. my hands wept that day’s icy rain as i swore to undo that kowtowing dribble of a man who slew my art of the winged white horse.  the spirit of that mare i rode fleeter than any hare, fleeter than any deer, fleeter than the wind through munster’s open country.  sing your provenance, our elder province. (eibhlín dubh ní chonaill)  i sang not for my own or for beauty's sake as much as to keep our spirits fired, knowing as long as we sang we'd not break, refusing to allow the country be shired. but it was too much when even our lands turned hostile and drove us like lapwings in the hard winter, together in dying bands, our swollen bellies pregnant with nothing. even the birds seemed to give up singing. so i lay down and relinquished song. but i should have kept up my amhrán-ing, adapting and transmuting their tongue. transform the spirit of where you belong, make something right out of what's wrong.  (tomás rua ó súilleabháin)  tell of those weather-sketched attic islanders who half-tamed their school of rocky blaskets, water spouting from the blowholes of cliffs.  tell how they were forced from their ithaca, still dreaming in the surf-rush of irish, the inland longing for the lilt of the sea.  in them uncover the destiny of everyone, for all are exiled and in search of a home, as you settle the eroding island of each poem.  (robin flower)  […]  the islands' standing army of gannets fiercely snap, stab and peck one another. few could match the spite i unleashed on any who encroached into my territory. i spat with petrel accuracy. i should have had the wisdom of the sad-eyed puffins who let everyone come close, sensing few mean hurt, though when forced to tussle they'll show their worth. so learn from me. when i come to mind don't recall how, feisty, i knocked nests of words over the edge, splattering on the rocks the crude squwaks of other ravaging, wing-elbowing birds; rather think of the winged poems i hatched, seen, regardless of time and place, gliding and gyring with their own grace. (patrick kavanagh)  life when it is gone is like a woman you were glad to be quit of only to find yourself years later longing for her, catching her scent on a crowded street. tell us of the seagull plundering your picnic before it wakes you. tell us of the rain tapping a pane while you're ensconced by the fire cradling a pregnant brandy glass.  (louis macneice)  can you still hear a distant train whistle blow? wet my whistle with a slug of guinness. what is the texture of fresh-fallen snow? do girls still wear their hair in braid? what's tea? what's the smell of the sea? tell me. tell me. i am beginning to fade.  (dylan thomas)  iv  the alarming, silhouetted bird has a preternatural quality as it flutters about my head, drawing me from sleep's underworld. i resist its pull. everything turns into dream's usual montage. another figure emerges but says nothing, as if that's what he came to say. his face merges into one of a gagged female. she shimmers and vanishes. dolphins break beyond blind man's cove, returning the dead to bull island, transmitting their encrypted, underwater morse. the savant local ferryman informs us that skellig michael was once a druidic site. his oil-wrinkled hands tug the engine cord, coaxing our boat out of the cliff-shaded cove. we withdraw into the distance, leaving a disgruntling sense that we've only touched the tip of these dark icebergs.

 cold wind comes out of the white hills and rubs itself against the walls of the condominium with an esophogeal vowel sound, and a loneliness creeps into the conversation by the hot tub.  we don’t deserve pleasure just as we don’t deserve pain, but it’s pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm mist keep rising from the surface of the water to wrap themselves around a sculpted clavicle or wrist.  it’s not just that we are on the eighth story of the world looking out through glass and steel with a clarity of vision in which imported coffee and a knowledge of french painting are combined,  but that we are atop a pyramid of all the facts that make this possible: the furnace that heats the water, the truck that hauled the fuel, the artery of highway blasted through the mountains,  the heart attack of the previous owner, the history of western medicine that failed to save him, the successful development of tourism, the snow white lotions that counteract the chemistry of chlorine upon skin—our skin.  down inside history’s body, the slaves are still singing in the dark; the roads continue to be built; the wind blows and the building grips itself in anticipation of the next strong gust.  so an enormous act of forgetting is required simply to kiss someone or to open your mouth for the fork of high-calorie paté someone is raising to your lips,  which, considering the price, it would be a sin not to enjoy.

 control that is liberation, a concentration  that is neither at one point nor diffuse,  like the globes of light hovering over the lampposts  in your myopia last night; wandering  across the river, the madrileños  also entonados swaying like palm fronds  in the wind;

the quarter is pacified.  clouds rise above guadarrama,  somosierra, above the meseta like kites.  the picoletos shift from foot to foot in long  black boots. bells bleat — lambs;  alsatians on leashes. the bougainvillea —  glad to bring us at last the first trace  of its colors — flaunts a breathless restraint.  •

 twenty-eight shotgun pellets crater my thighs, belly and groin. i gently thumb each burnt bead, fingering scabbed stubs with ointment.  could have neutered me, made extinct the volatile, romantic man i am. “he’s dead,” doctor at emergency room could’ve easily told my wife that night. instead, “soak him in a bath twice a day. apply this ointment to the sores. here’s a month’s supply of pain killers.” i remember the deep guttural groan i gave, when the doctor pressed my groin. assured i could still make love, morphine drowsed me and in a dull stupor i don’t remember police visiting my bed, or laughing so hard, they scowled for a serious answer. i howled a u.f.o. shot me along the río grande, and they cursed and left.  in the summer of ’88 i’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf. still smelling of milk udders, i tied it to the truck rack and drove off. its hooves teethed at pink roots ’til the whole lush field went bare dirt. a magnificent bull. glowing wheel of heart breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn. he wrangled his black brawn like a battleshield to challenge the sun, reared thick neck down and sideways, lunged at me with dart and snort, hoof-stamped and nostrilled dirt, ’til i growled him back whipping air with a limber willow branch, poured grain in trough and spread alfalfa. i respected his horns and he the whistling menace of willow.  one afternoon my cousin patricio helped me band the bull’s scrotum, usurp swollen sap in his testicle sack. it withered to a pink wattle and seeded the garden to drive cornstalks to bear hardy, golden horns.  thereafter, he grazed the fenceline, with the tempered lust and peaceful grace of a celibate priest. his bearing now arranged itself elegant as a wild flower sprung over night. ______________  perfecto shot it. rasping on a black rope of blood round its neck, it staggered, bouldering convulsions. blood exploding in bright lash of earthquaked air, it stumble-butted stock trailer fender— second and third shots glowed its death.  a quivering shadow of life-flame darkened the air and it sputtered a last drop of blood. i drank long swigs of whiskey and, thinking it was dead, turned to walk away, then it gave a tremendous groan, tremendous groan, a birth-letting groan . . . a moon groan . . . blood spurted out, thick, thick, thick alleys of dead star blood  and i turned and said aloud to myself, “that’s the moon’s voice! that’s the moon’s voice!”  and the white moon was in the sky, and i looked at the moon for a long time. ______________  i sat on the ground and gulped whiskey, drank the steer’s death still warm in my throat. a beautiful animal! i allowed to be butchered. when it trounced and galloped in the field, its body was a dark, windy cliff edge, and its eyes were doorways of a dream— now it bled a charred scroll of ancient chant in gravel, i would never know, and its blackened logs of blood smoldered dying vowels, i would never hear. my heart’s creak-n-tremble rage milled the steer’s death to red grist, i grieved, i wept drunkenly that no one cared, that humankind betrayed him, that we were all cowards. ______________  perfecto, valasquez and the butcher tried to stop me from driving, but now was the time to settle a bad feud with another friend. redeem the bull’s blood with ours. i drove to felipe’s house, anger knotted in me tight as the rope tied to the stock trailer steer strained against. i pulled, but could not free myself. (i had a dream night before— i crossed black-iron footbridge, partially collapsed by sea storm. left-hand railing swept out to sea, i gripped bolt-studded right-hand railing, finger-clutched wire netting sides, carefully descended waist-high water. waded through slowly and ascended other side— but had lost my sunglasses and wallet, went back, groped bottom, found them and ascended again.)  had to cross that bridge again. full of significance . . . tonight, deepest part of flooded bridge was danger . . . drowning . . . represented years of my life collapsed and destroyed, water the cleansing element, my ascent from had healed, onto firm ground, but i went back, to re-live destruction… “felipe!” i yelled, porch light flicked on, illuminating the yard. “came to fight,” i said, “take off your glasses.”  bug-eyes glazed bewildered, then gray slits of lips snarled, “you motherless dog!” he withdrew in darkness a moment, reappeared on porch, serrated saw of his voice cut the chill dark, “¡hijo de su pinche madre! ¡mátalo!   ¡¡mátalo!!”  first shot framed darkness round me with a spillway of bright light, eruption of sound, and second shot roared a spray of brilliance and the third gave an expanded halo-flash. my legs woozed, and then i buckled to the ground. (i thought, holy shit, what ever happened to the old yard-style fight between estranged friends!)  i groaned with the steer, and crawled my dead legs to the truck, lunged on elbows into the cab, hand lifting the dead stone beneath my waist to clutch and brake.  following morning calls came, “tell us who did it gato!” “our rifles are loaded!” i said, “leave it alone. what would you do if a drunk man came into your yard, threatened to beat you?” i wanted peace, wanted to diffuse the immovable core of vengeance in my heart, i had carried since a child, dismantle the bloody wheel of violence i had ridden since a child.  during my week in bed, pellets pollinated me with a forgotten peace, and between waking thoughts of anger and vengeance, sleep was a small meadow of light, a clearing i walked into and rested. fragrance of peace filled me as fragrance of flowers and dirt permeate hands that work in the garden all day.  curandero came to visit, and said, “the bull in ancient times was the symbol of females. did you know that? killing the bull, is killing the intuitive part of yourself, the feminine part. did you realize, when jesus was raising lazarus, he groaned in his spirit and that bull groaned, and when you killed the bull, it was raising you. the dying bull gave birth to you and now you are either blessed or cursed. the flood of that bull’s blood, is either going to drown you or liberate you, but it will not be wasted.”

 the frost performs its secret ministry, unhelped by any wind. the owlet's cry came loud—and hark, again! loud as before. the inmates of my cottage, all at rest, have left me to that solitude, which suits abstruser musings: save that at my side my cradled infant slumbers peacefully. 'tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness. sea, hill, and wood, this populous village! sea, and hill, and wood, with all the numberless goings-on of life, inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not; only that film, which fluttered on the grate,  still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing. methinks, its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live, making it a companionable form, whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets, every where echo or mirror seeking of itself, and makes a toy of thought.  but o! how oft, how oft, at school, with most believing mind, presageful, have i gazed upon the bars, to watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft with unclosed lids, already had i dreamt of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower, whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang from morn to evening, all the hot fair-day, so sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come! so gazed i, till the soothing things, i dreamt, lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams! and so i brooded all the following morn, awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book: save if the door half opened, and i snatched a hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up, for still i hoped to see the stranger's face, townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, my play-mate when we both were clothed alike!  dear babe, that sleepest cradled by my side, whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm, fill up the intersperséd vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought! my babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart with tender gladness, thus to look at thee, and think that thou shalt learn far other lore, and in far other scenes! for i was reared in the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim, and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars. but thou, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds, which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language, which thy god utters, who from eternity doth teach himself in all, and all things in himself. great universal teacher! he shall mould thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.  therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee, whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy apple-tree, while the night-thatch smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall heard only in the trances of the blast, or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles, quietly shining to the quiet moon.

 the grammatical rules of this language can be learned in one sitting.  nouns have no gender &amp; end in -o; the plural terminates in -oj (pronounced -oy) &amp; the accusative, -on (plural 0ojn).  amiko, friend; amikoj, friends; amikon &amp; amikojn, accusative friend &amp; friends.  adjectives end in –a &amp; take plural &amp; accusative endings to agree with things.  ma amiko is my friend.  all verbs are regular &amp; have only one form for each tense or mood; they are not altered for person or number. mi havas bonajn amikojn is simply to say i have good friends.  adverbs end in –e.  la bonaj amiko estas ie. the good friend is here.  -   a new book appears in esperanto every week. radio stations in europe, the united states, china, russia &amp; brazil broadcast in esperanto, as does vatican radio. in 1959, unesco declared the international federation of esperanto speakers to be in accord with its mission &amp; granted this body consultative status. the youth branch of the international federation of esperanto speakers, uta, has offices in 80 different countries &amp; organizes social events where young people curious about the movement may dance to recordings by esperanto artists, enjoy complimentary soft drinks &amp; take home esperanto versions of major literary works including the old testament &amp;a midsummer night’s dream. william shatner’s first feature-length vehicle was a horror film shot entirely in esperanto. esperanto is among the languages currently sailing into deep space on board the voyager spacecraft.  -   esperanto is an artificial language constructed in 1887 by l. l. zamenhof, a polish oculist. i first came across fundamento esperanto, the text which introduced this system to the world, as i travelled abroad  following a somewhat difficult period in my life. it was twilight &amp; snowing on the railway platform just outside warsaw where i had missed my connection. a man in a crumpled track suit &amp; dark glasses pushed a cart piled high with ripped &amp; weathered volumes—  sex manuals, detective stories, yellowing musical scores &amp; outdated physics textbooks, old copies of life, new smut, an atlas translated, a grammar,the mirror, soviet-bloc comics, a guide to the rivers &amp; mountains, thesauri, inscrutable  musical scores &amp; mimeographed physics books, defective stories, obsolete sex manuals— one of which caught my notice (dr. esperanto, zamenhof’s pen name, translates as he who hopes) &amp; since i had time, i traded my used leaves of grass for a copy.  -   mi amas vin, bela amiko. i’m afraid i will never be lonely enough. there’s a man from quebec in my head,  a friend to the purple martins. purple martins are the cadillac of swallows. all purple martins are dying or dead. brainscans of grown purple martins suggest these creatures feel the same levels of doubt  &amp; bliss as an eight-year-old girl in captivity. while driving home from the brewery one night this man from quebec heard a radio program about purple martins &amp; the next day he set out to build them a house in his own back yard. i’ve never built anything, let alone a house,  not to mention a home for somebody else.  i’ve never unrolled a blueprint onto a workbench, sunk a post, or sent the neighbor’s kid pedalling off to the store for a bag full of nails.  i’ve never waited ten years for a swallow.  never put in aluminum floors to smooth over the waiting. never piped sugar water through colored tubes to each empty nest lined with newspaper shredded with strong, tired hands. never dismantled the entire affair  &amp; put it back together again. still no swallows. i never installed the big light that stays on through the night  to keep owls away. never installed lesser lights, never rested on sunday  with a beer on the deck surveying what i had done &amp; what yet remained to be done, listening to styx  while the neighbor kids ran through my sprinklers. i have never collapsed in abandon. never prayed. but enough about purple martins.  -   as we speak, esperanto is being corrupted by upset languages such as interlingua, klingon, java &amp; various cryptophasic tongues.  our only hope of reversing this trend is to write the esperanto epic. through its grandeur &amp; homegrown humility, it will spur men  to freeze the mutating patios so the children of our children’s children may dwell in this song &amp; find comfort in its true texture &amp; frame.  it’s worth a try. as i imagine it, it ends in the middle of things. every line of the work is a first &amp; a last line &amp; this is the spring  of its action. of course, there’s a journey &amp; inside that journey, an implicit voyage through the underworld. there’s a bridge  made of boats; a carp stuffed with flowers; a comic dispute among sweetmeat vendors; a digression on shadows; men clapping  in fields to scare away crows; an unending list of warships:the unternehmen, the impresa, the muyarchi, viec lam, the przedsiebiorstwo,  the indarka, the enterprise, l’entreprise, entrepeno

 william de la pole, duke of suffolk: beheaded 1450 john tiptoft, earl of worcester: beheaded 1470 anthony woodville, earl rivers: beheaded 1483 1  processionals in the exemplary cave, benediction of shadows. pomfret. london. the voice fragrant with mannered humility, with an equable contempt for this world, ‘in honorem trinitatis’. crash. the head struck down into a meaty conduit of blood. so these dispose themselves to receive each pentecostal blow from axe or seraph, spattering block-straw with mortal residue. psalteries whine through the empyrean. fire flares in the pit, ghosting upon stone creatures of such rampant state, vacuous ceremony of possession, restless habitation, no man’s dwelling-place.   2  for whom do we scrape our tribute of pain— for none but the ritual king? we meditate a rueful mystery; we are dying to satisfy fat caritas, those wiped jaws of stone. (suppose all reconciled by silent music; imagine the future flashed back at us, like steel against sun, ultimate recompense.) recall the cold of towton on palm sunday before dawn, wakefield, tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets shrilling into the ruck; some trampled acres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet, stuck with strange-postured dead. recall the wind’s flurrying, darkness over the human mire.   3  they bespoke doomsday and they meant it by god, their curved metal rimming the low ridge. but few appearances are like this. once every five hundred years a comet’s over-riding stillness might reveal men in such array, livid and featureless, with england crouched beastwise beneath it all. ‘oh, that old northern business …’ a field after battle utters its own sound which is like nothing on earth, but is earth. blindly the questing snail, vulnerable mole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly among carnage the most delicate souls tup in their marriage-blood, gasping ‘jesus’.   4  let mind be more precious than soul; it will not endure. soul grasps its price, begs its own peace, settles with tears and sweat, is possibly indestructible. that i can believe. though i would scorn the mere instinct of faith, expediency of assent, if i dared, what i dare not is a waste history or void rule. averroes, old heathen, if only you had been right, if intellect itself were absolute law, sufficient grace, our lives could be a myth of captivity which we might enter: an unpeopled region of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing with perpetual silence as with torches.   5  as with torches we go, at wild christmas, when we revel in our atonement through thirty feasts of unction and slaughter, what is that but the soul’s winter sleep? so many things rest under consummate justice as though trumpets purified law, spikenard were the real essence of remorse. the sky gathers up darkness. when we chant ‘ora, ora pro nobis’ it is not seraphs who descend to pity but ourselves. those righteously-accused those vengeful racked on articulate looms indulge us with lingering shows of pain, a flagrant tenderness of the damned for their own flesh:   6  my little son, when you could command marvels without mercy, outstare the wearisome dragon of sleep, i rejoiced above all— a stranger well-received in your kingdom. on those pristine fields i saw humankind as it was named by the father; fabulous beasts rearing in stillness to be blessed. the world’s real cries reached there, turbulence from remote storms, rumour of solitudes, a composed mystery. and so it ends. some parch for what they were; others are made blind to all but one vision, their necessity to be reconciled. i believe in my abandonment, since it is what i have.   7  ‘prowess, vanity, mutual regard, it seemed i stared at them, they at me. that was the gorgon’s true and mortal gaze: averted conscience turned against itself.’ a hawk and a hawk-shadow. ‘at noon, as the armies met, each mirrored the other; neither was outshone. so they flashed and vanished and all that survived them was the stark ground of this pain. i made no sound, but once i stiffened as though a remote cry had heralded my name. it was nothing …’ reddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few feathers drifted across; carrion birds strutted upon the armour of the dead.   8  not as we are but as we must appear, contractual ghosts of pity; not as we desire life but as they would have us live, set apart in timeless colloquy. so it is required; so we bear witness, despite ourselves, to what is beyond us, each distant sphere of harmony forever poised, unanswerable. if it is without consequence when we vaunt and suffer, or if it is not, all echoes are the same in such eternity. then tell me, love, how that should comfort us—or anyone dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place, crying to the end ‘i have not finished’.

 the generalissimo’s glands directed him to and fro.geronimo! said the über-goon we called god, and we were off to the races. never mind that we could only grow gray things, that inspecting the horses’ gums in the gymnasium predicted a jagged road ahead. we were tired of hard news— it helped to turn down our hearing aids. we could already all do impeccable imitations of the idiot, his insistent incisors working on a steak as he said there’s an intimacy to invasion. that much was true. when we got jaded about joyrides, we could always play games in the kitchen garden with the prisoners. jump the gun, fine kettle of fish and kick the kidney were our favorites. the laws the linguists thought up were particularly lissome, full of magical loopholes that spit out medals. we had made the big time, but night still nipped at our heels. the navigator’s needle swung strangely, oscillating between the oilwells and ask again later. we tried to pull ourselves together by practicing quarterback sneaks along the pylons, but the race to the ravine was starting to feel as real as the r.i.p.’s and roses carved into rock. suddenly the sight of a schoolbag could send us scrambling.

 the young man, hardly more than a boy, who fired the shot had looked at him with an air not of anger but of concentration, as if he were surveying a road, or feeding a length of wood into a saw: it had to be done just so.  the bullet passed through his upper chest, below the collar bone. the pain was not what he might have feared. strangely exhilarated  he staggered out of the pasture and into a grove of trees.  he pressed and pressed the wound, trying to stanch the blood, but he could only press what he could reach, and he could not reach his back, where the bullet had exited. he lay on the earth smelling the leaves and mosses, musty and damp and cool after the blaze of open afternoon.  how good the earth smelled, as it had when he was a boy hiding from his father, who was intent of strapping him for doing his chores late one time too many.  a cowbird razzed from a rail fence. it isn't mockery, he thought, no malice in it. . . just a noise. stray bullets nicked the oaks overhead. leaves and splinters fell.  someone near him groaned. but it was his own voice he heard. his fingers and feet tingled, the roof of his mouth, and the bridge of his nose. . . .  he became dry, dry, and thought of christ, who said,i thirst. his man-smell, the smell of his hair and skin, his sweat, the salt smell of his cock and the little ferny hairs that two women had known  left him, and a sharp, almost sweet smell began to rise from his open mouth in the warm shade of the oaks. a streak of sun climbed the rough trunk of a tree, but he did not see it with his open eye.

 so, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night, and to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair, till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight, and to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,  say, must you taunt me forever, forever? you looked at my hand and you knew that i was the slave of the ring, while you were as free as the wind is free. when i saw your corpse in your coffin, i flung back your flower to you; it was all of yours that i ever had; you may keep it, and—keep from me.  ah? so god is your witness. has god, then, no world to look after but ours? may he not have been searching for that wild stat, with the trailing plumage, that flew far over a part of our darkness while we were there by the freezing flowers, or else brightening some planet’s luminous rings, instead of thinking of you?  or, if he was near us at all, do you think that he would sit listening there because you sang “hear me, norma,” to a woman in jewels and lace, while, so close to us, down in another street, in the wet, unlighted air, there were children crying for bread and fire, and mothers who questioned his grace?  or perhaps he had gone to the ghastly field where the fight had been that day, to number the bloody stabs that were there, to look at and judge the dead; or else to the place full of fever and moans where the wretched wounded lay; at least i do not believe that he cares to remember a word that you said.  so take back your flowers, i tell you—of its sweetness i now have no need; yes; take back your flower down into the stillness and mystery to keep; when you wake i will take it, and god, then, perhaps will witness indeed, but go, now, and tell death he must watch you, and not let you walk in your sleep.

 when it’s that time of month it’s like falling backwards in “time.”  god has abandoned her glass carriage, she is “dead.”  and the edges of objects: wavy in the eye that’s about to cry,  a twitter running down the spine of… oh god, it can’t be. (insert song of mourning.)  god and time, spine of the world— yawn, blah, blah, schma… what i meant to say is  it’s hard to be a capitalist.  if the world’s time is god, and she’s birds atwitter, then why must i go to work? the answer writes itself:  left to my own devices i’d just sink into the soil. that is, write, with dirt  as my pillow.   in the hole between twitters  there’s random patches of mud-sky. so humid.  there’re chairs growing in hell.  there’re chairs growing in hell, and people sit on them, my co-workers: it’s like riding on toadstools except you don’t know it, or you kind of know it that time of  month. that’s when you feel the twitter, the muddy shiver.  you dream of your uncle turning a lamb on a spit high on a green cliff, with fog thickening around him  and then he’s made to swallow keys and little hammers—  you claw the red clay. now wake. show me the bouquet!  no, don’t show me the bouquet.  show me the bouquet! if you do, i won’t tell on you  to the rose of the world. she can make him hear you up there. besides, it’s not a cliff, it’s a chair.  and the rose is god. got it? gott it?  this is why women should be president.  
NEW POEM
 sometimes it takes miles to give up resistance, though the mirror shows a body unresisting, shows perhaps something to admire. others may. a body without difficulty loosening, breaking its own willfulness, cracking itself like a rusted bolt that finally begins to turn. a body that turns. toward openness, fantasy, those desires of and not of the body. sometimes i notice a powerful man engaged steadily repeating difficult action: folding himself, his tight skin, over and over, lifting a declined torso or pulling up a suspended trunk, and think, how neat, how controlled to be inside that body. i struggle not to stare, grip myself not to lose myself inside the thought of being inside that body. i can never get there i know because it is the image i want, the veneer of muscle having taken primacy from mind, now first among equals: bicep, abdominal, quadricep, the launch after launch of a perpetual run. i want the image even when i am it, or nearly it— because even then, i am also that other thing, self-conscious, burdened, struggling for movement.  if there is a link between god and animals— the way he identifies with the so much that isn’t us, as he had to have, to have made them— it must be in the body enacting will immediate through movement, as if with a word creating a world (enacting creation immediate through speech). which is to say, this is my time of prayer, my only time: miles in, as long as it takes for the body to relinquish resistance. bright, public, surrounded by others who move toward better movement. and all the while seeing in a wall of mirrors that image of myself, deer, horse, running close kin to breathing, motion necessary to survival, perfect image of a man that i’m merely a self-conscious copy of. i pray for things, of course, for myself and for those whose pain touches me, selfish and unselfish prayers for intimates and strangers. i pray for the runner in the mirror, too, sleek, easy animal, unselfconscious and present, and absent as a god, the man who could almost be me, who i do my best to rush toward. i pray that one day, by his grace, we may meet.

 even in fortunate times, the nectar is spiked with woe. gods are incorrigibly capricious, and the needy beg in nineveh or sleep in paper-gusting plazas of the new world’s shopping malls.  meantime, the tyrant battens on conquest, while advisers, angling for preferment, seek expedient paths. heartbroken, the faithful advocate looks back on cities of the plain and trudges into exile.  and if any era thrives, it’s only because, somewhere, in a plane tree’s shade, friends sketch the dust with theorems and proofs, or because, instinctively, a man puts his arm around the shoulder of grief and walks it (for an hour or an age) through all its tears and telling.

 good-bye, proud world! i'm going home: thou art not my friend, and i'm not thine. long through thy weary crowds i roam; a river-ark on the ocean brine, long i've been tossed like the driven foam; but now, proud world! i'm going home.  good-bye to flattery's fawning face; to grandeur with his wise grimace; to upstart wealth's averted eye; to supple office, low and high; to crowded halls, to court and street; to frozen hearts and hasting feet; to those who go, and those who come; good-bye, proud world! i'm going home.  i am going to my own hearth-stone, bosomed in yon green hills alone, — a secret nook in a pleasant land, whose groves the frolic fairies planned; where arches green, the livelong day, echo the blackbird's roundelay, and vulgar feet have never trod a spot that is sacred to thought and god.  o, when i am safe in my sylvan home, i tread on the pride of greece and rome; and when i am stretched beneath the pines, where the evening star so holy shines, i laugh at the lore and the pride of man, at the sophist schools, and the learned clan; for what are they all, in their high conceit, when man in the bush with god may meet?

 lordship is the same activity whether performed by lord or lady. or a lord who happens to be a lady, all the source and all the faults.  a woman steadfast in looking is a callot, and any woman in the wrong place or outside of her proper location is, by definition, a foolish woman.  the harlot is talkative and wandering by the way, not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home, now abroad, now in the streets,  now lying in wait near the corners, her hair straying out of its wimple. the collar of her shift and robe pressed one upon the other.  she goes to the green to see to her geese, and trips to wrestling matches and taverns. the said margery left her home in the parish of bishopshill,  and went to a house, the which the witness does not remember, and stayed there from noon of that day until the darkness of night.  but a whip made of raw hippopotamus hide, trimmed like a corkscrew, and anon the creature was stabled in her wits as well as ever she was biforn,  and prayed her husband as so soon as he came to her that she might have the keys to her buttery to take her meat and drink.  he should never have my good will for to make my sister for to sell candle and mustard in framlyngham, or fill her shopping list with crossbows,  almonds, sugar and cloth. the captainess, the vowess, must use herself to work readily as other gentilwomen doon,  in the innermost part of her house, in a great chamber far from the road. so love your windows as little as you can, for we be, either of us, weary of other.

 for alvester james long after it was necessary, uncle vess ate the leavings off the hog, doused them with vinegar sauce. he ate chewy abominations. then came high pressure. then came the little pills. then came the doctor who stole vess’s second sight, the predication of pig’s blood every fourth sunday. then came the stillness of barn earth, no more trembling at his step. then came the end of the rib, but before his eyes clouded, uncle vess wrote down the gospel of barbecue.  chapter one: somebody got to die with something at some time or another.  chapter two: don’t ever trust white folk to cook your meat until it’s done to the bone.  chapter three: december is the best time for hog killing. the meat won’t spoil as quick. screams and blood freeze over before they hit the air.  chapter four, verse one: great grandma mandy used to say food you was whipped for tasted the best.  chapter four, verse two: old master knew to lock the ham bacon chops away quick or the slaves would rob him blind. he knew a padlock to the smokehouse was best to prevent stealing, but even the sorriest of slaves would risk a beating for a full belly. so christmas time he give his nasty leftovers to the well behaved. the head ears snout tail fatback chitlins feet ribs balls. he thought gratitude made a good seasoning.  chapter five: unclean means dirty means filthy means underwear worn too long in summertime heat. perfectly good food can’t be no sin. maybe the little bit of meat on ribs makes for lean eating. maybe the pink flesh is tasteless until you add onions garlic black pepper tomatoes soured apple cider but survival ain’t never been no crime against nature or maker. see, stay alive in the meantime, laugh a little harder. go on and gnaw that bone clean.

 tomb of a millionaire, a multi-millionaire, ladies and gentlemen, place of the dead where they spend every year the usury of twenty-five thousand dollars for upkeep and flowers to keep fresh the memory of the dead. the merchant prince gone to dust commanded in his written will over the signed name of his last testament twenty-five thousand dollars be set aside for roses, lilacs, hydrangeas, tulips, for perfume and color, sweetness of remembrance around his last long home.  (a hundred cash girls want nickels to go to the movies to-night. in the back stalls of a hundred saloons, women are at tables drinking with men or waiting for men jingling loose silver dollars in their pockets. in a hundred furnished rooms is a girl who sells silk or dress goods or leather stuff for six dollars a week wages and when she pulls on her stockings in the morning she is reckless about god and the newspapers and the police, the talk of her home town or the name people call her.)  
NEW POEM
 my father had several times expressed a fear of being buried alive. i insisted that the doctor should do whatever was necessary. the doctor asked me to leave the room. when i came back, he was able to assure me that renoir was dead!  jean renoir it is not 1937 for long. a clump of ash trees and a walk down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up in a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while at their center the projectionist, jean renoir, on a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds, and turtles for the sleepy children. corks come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset and, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks  into the boathouse to the linens:at last, it is 1915! a bird screams over the lake, two bats flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp, interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over water the the acceptance of white tablecloths on the darkening shore of the lake. a torch is lit for its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects. this film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders, not music and algebra but a war and, then, yet another war. . .  but we begin with the captured officers digging a tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall. the boches observe the frenchmen working with their hoes as from the trousers of a boy dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure! the prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled with snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow while germans with rifles on a hill are unable to kill them, for they have escaped into switzerland with its feather-brushed trees  and patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village. isn’t this the ending of the film? no! i’m sorry but there is a single blossom on the geranium, and when it falls, captain de boeldieu dies, discovering his afterlife along a november road— he does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film suffers its true conclusion. the two men hiding in the marsh will escape across the border, only to be returned to the continuing war. this is why there is no importance to your version of the story. and there will be another war. and more horror for the geranium! so, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive a steamer trunk filled with women’s clothing, they will all perform in a revue: a chorus of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings, garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and large paper carnations riding up like epaulets  on their broad shoulders. these poignant inversions are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing, in this comedy, their national anthem! the russian prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their mysterious czarina; the men open it expecting vodka and sausages. the box is filled with straw and books on cooking, painting, and algebra. in disgust they burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier  of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe! now, these officers who are escape artists are moved as an elite corps and north to wintersborn. later, they are taken to a damp limestone castle from which no one will escape. the commandant is the stoic aristocrat, rauffenstein, his head is in a brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon. i mean no disrespect, but the balding rauffenstein is an abject picture of suffering. his villa has but one flower, a tall laden geranium.  rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, boeldieu, are friends. both would know that to clear a monocle one uses spirits of vinegar. they stand confirmed in manner beside a squirrel cage. rauffenstein feels superior to the other two principals, the rich jew, rosenthal, and the charming emotional marechal. these two hide in the marsh while boeldieu dies of a bullet wound. only a king may kill a king! and rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim but missing the leg; he severed in three places boeldieu’s intestine!  the captain is given a room in the turret that holds the flowering geranium. now comes the oratio obliqua of the marksman, rauffenstein; the disfigured commandant is sincerely saddened at having killed the noble captain. but before the shooting and escape we sensed the captain’s sacrifice was not sacrifice, or suicide, but the grand escape—a country road into another landscape. . . there are bells tolling down in the village. rosenthal and marechal with ropes have dropped  past the castle’s battlements to the ground. they run away across snowy farmland. marechal’s teeth are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco. rosenthal and marechal are extremes who have strong feelings for each other. they are befriended by a german widow, ulsa, and her daughter, lotte; ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome jew. he promises to return for her when the war is over. he will lose both his legs at mégéglise. this is not known within the story, but he’ll bleed  to death beside a little bridge. he lived his illusion in the orient of delacroix, his servants were syrians and negroes. he loved the little ivory spoons that chinese women in the open markets use to bathe and freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out of huge clay bowls. . . in the boathouse the children sleep, while jean’s oldest cousin, drunken, falls out of a rowboat. the lone swimmer has joined renior on the raft. the film now reveals the first diversion as all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing several hundred wooden flutes, the noise is like women crying over the fresh mounds at verdun. this diversion is not illusion and as the boches collect the flutes, the drunken cousin tries to join renior on the raft. boeldieu flees to the heights of the castle, the second diversion! we hear:halt! halt! halt! a gunshot, and chowder with blood falls from boeldieu’s opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard.  there are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled courtyard floor. scissors cut the blue blossom from the geranium. boeldieu will die. . . dead, he awakens on a country road where, now a peasant, he walks a white horse under the looming, bare trees. rosenthal and marechal are watching as they hide in the dead marsh flowers of an early november. they are alive. they do not recognize their friend. renoir’s cousin, asking for more wine, climbing onto the raft, spills  everything, and the projector with its crude lamp sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake— its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere lost off a cable that frayed, whoever is alive inside the iron bell is experiencing an eternal falling through water without the promise of a bottom. . . it’s 1937, the children asleep in the boathouse are being aroused, they wake to a bat caught in the wall of linen, they think it’s their uncle still casting images of animals for them. . .

 from a distance, at night, they seem to be  industries—all lit up but not on the map;  or, in this scientific age, they could be  installations for launching rocket ships—  so solid, and with such security, are they. . .  ah, but up close, by the light of day,  we see, not “pads” but actual paddies—  for these are simply silos in ricefields,  structures to hold the harvested grain.  still, they're the tallest things around,  and, by night or day, you'd have to say  they're ample for what they do: storage.  and, if you amble around from your car,  you can lean up against one in the sun,  feeling warmth on your cheek as you spread  out your arms, holding on to the whole world  around you, to the shores of other lands  where the laborers launched their lives  to arrive and plant and harvest this grain  of history—as you hold and look, look  up, up, up, and whisper: “grandfather!”

 “in warm sunlight jade engenders smoke”; poetry, like indigo mountain, keeps its distance;  the light plays words and figures, stone’s edge edged with air, green haze growing.  amused by butterflies, chuang tsu dreaming, the emperor’s heart in spring, thoroughly transformed.  still, in pieces, the words rest so much apart. risking my life i lean on dangerous railings.   when the dream wakes to its own particulars, the strands scattered, loose hair on muslin,  broken characters the reeds make, unmake— vague    no reason bright    again    dark—

 he stood up suddenly and threw himself and his grey canvas sack to the bus's floor, then, clutching the sack's edges, he struck the floor with it again, four or five times, then stopped. no one moved, everyone had moved for a moment, away from him as he had struck the floor.  he sat looking at the contents of the bag, now strewn all over. cassetts, broken cassette cases, assorted papers, and pieces of his old cassette recorder. he sat quite still for a moment. whatever had been happening wasn't happening anymore.  nothing continued to happen, then something began to happen again. he began to pick up his things, put them into the sack. no one moved. they all looked at him, or they all tried not to look at him. he put his things into the sack with steadily increasing speed.  
NEW POEM
 off-season and in the burnt forest of my nightgown, a feral undergrowth that marks me as burial site— to be still enough or just enough.  my arms become fat arms: hearth. i eat dirt for doubt, a secret bleached old as lie. i out-want like a spindly winged monster. if i were a bug— were i—then you'd hope for reparation, and paint more brown into the plot.

 “all accounts of the past are made up of possibilities.”  —dionisio martinez  for larry villanueva i. for years, you were a story of ancestors, pre-revolutionary cuba: barrios, donate, gallata, villanueva, family names strung and pearled in the caribbean by blood and memory, nostalgia and calamity en artemisa, a small town in my mother’s childhood, a woman in december of 1967, your tía marta, a hospital room en la covadonga, rows and rows of children, my sisters, unexpectedly two, your cousins, whose clothes mae and mitzy wore into history and exile.  en el exilo, la cuba del norte, ten years after the summer of el mariel, you were my map of cuba, un espejo, un reflejo, a tisa-blue knot of possibility. mi esquina habanera, a street en la arquitectura del pasado, a superficial distance in the patina of memory, a me i had never really known, a language i had learned not to think in.  later, you were a face on t.v. en guadalupe, maría elena, my mother’s telenovelas en el canal 23, an actor, a director, a sculptor, abstract angst with a face history and coincidence had given me.  ii. so when you become fingerprints and words, a noun, a verb, a snapshot in motion, i am no longer alone with my ghosts, las sombras de el pasado, inventing truth, reclaiming language, my old self. i am me, unadorned by speech, english or translation; i am an i, simple, exposed, this afternoon in our lives, a conversation about the circle of coincidence and persuasion, a photograph of an idea we once were, and you are familiar, somehow.  iii. constantly returning, we breathe in spanish, move through blank spaces like incantations, waiting for words to fill a moment (often ninety miles long) with etymology, jargon, ghostwords, shadows and nostalgia, and become harina de castilla, larry, re-shaped, translated, improvised, sculpted and redefined.

 the heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn, as a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on, afar o’er life’s turrets and vales does it roam in the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.  the heart of a woman falls back with the night, and enters some alien cage in its plight, and tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars while it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.

 at the confluence of tea roses and russian sage we made a right at the curved iron fence, one of my dead friends beside me explaining how trees communicated but i couldn’t understand a thing because it was all blurry — the way it gets — and though i knew him well i couldn’t say for sure now whether it was larry or phil or galway or charlie until i realized it was me talking in some kind of hebrish they spoke in my town by the delaware and it was used for code the way one of the amerindian languages was used in world war ii the germans couldn’t in a million years break since they weren’t as pragmatic irrational and in-your-face as the english and americans were.  i noticed the bees were digging in for a late lunch of what for them was boiled beef and horseradish or maybe it was just for me and they were bent over guzzling madly while paying no attention to the two of us or in any way tired of the nectars since it ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to — well — boiled beef to strawberry-rhubarb pie and a little whisky after, some of it spilled on the vanilla ice cream that underlaid the pie it had once overlaid, all of this depending on the blossoms they circled over and bent down upon, a cafeteria as good as the one on broadway called stanley’s i circled and bent over expending nickels dimes and quarters when the dulles brothers ran the country.  it was larry, i’m sure now,  and what we talked about was cardboard and we were amazed that in the open spaces beside the hotel on 47th street there were four or five small cardboard “houses,” both of us remembered, the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags, the size of a room at the sloane house on 34th street near the pennsylvania station where i put up the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase with little or no stuffing and a cardboard bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats, cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon for costume dances, balls is what we called them as if we were art students in paris about to swim in the nearest fountain.  though what i want to  say is the bees were too busy to do us any harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms of bees, that terrified me (larry, too) except for one occasion when i pushed the wrong end of an old broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased me through the yard and over a fence hating any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or gentrification, i who couldn’t resist intrusions, who never could, omnivorous as i was, living on apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops, who ran like hell that day (larry, too) for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be paralyzed then eaten by larvae, none of us dead ones did.

 there is no noisier place than the suburbs, someone once said to me as we were walking along a fairway, and every day is delighted to offer fresh evidence:  the chainsaw, the leaf-blower blowing one leaf around an enormous house with columns, on mondays and thursdays the garbage truck equipped with air brakes, reverse beeper, and merciless grinder.  there’s dogs, hammers, backhoes or serious earthmovers if today is not your day. how can the birds get a peep or a chirp in edgewise, i would like to know?  but this morning is different, only a soft clicking sound and the low talk of two workmen working on the house next door, laying tile i am guessing.  otherwise, all quiet for a change, just the clicking of tiles being handled and their talking back and forth in spanish then one of them asking in english  “what was her name?” and the silence of the other.

 mistress adrienne, i have been given a bed with a pink dresser in the hothouse joining the concord public library: the walls and roof are glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. i get my meals with the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine to use. i scour, sweep, and dust. i hope you don’t think of me as a runaway? i remember your kindness, your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. my journey was unusual. i saw some of the war and it was terrible even far up into the north. my first fright was at a train depot outside memphis where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first i helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox of the locomotive, then, i was shown to a gentleman in the passenger car who was searching for his runaway negress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me,  and i was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into an open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me a man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl maybe twelve years of age, across from them a sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, by afternoon she was dead, her two friends just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. the girl next to me whimpered and shook. those quinces just ran straight through me and all i could do was squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters and hay. we were given that night confederate uniforms to mend and when the others slept i dressed in three shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, the padding helped some but i couldn’t walk the next day. i hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall split palings. the next morning from a hill i watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from a battle scene. that night i found a horse with a bit in its mouth made of telegraph wire. he carried me up all the way to youngstown.chloe, you must learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel.

 nothing has changed. they have a welcome sign, a hill with cows and a white house on top, a mall and grocery store where people shop, a diner where some people go to dine. it is the same no matter where you go, and downtown you will find no big surprises. each fall the dew point falls until it rises. white snow, green buds, green lawn, red leaves, white snow.  this is all right. this is their hope. and yet, though what you see is never what you get, it does feel somehow changed from what it was. is it the people? houses? fields? the weather? is it the streets? is it these things together? nothing here ever changes, till it does.

 i. ancient overture of hérodiade  the nurse  (incantation)  abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears, the naked golds lashing the crimson space, an aurora—heraldic plumage—has chosen to embrace our cinerary tower of sacrifice, heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes… ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes! no splashing! the gloomy water, standing still, no longer visited by snowy quill or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving, of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb of its feathers, it buried its head, undone by the pure diamond of a star, but one of long ago, which never even shone.  crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre! empurpled sky, complicit in the mire, and stained-glass windows opening red on carnage.  the strange chamber, framed in all the baggage of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint, has yesteryear’s snows instead of its ancient tint; and its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases with the buried eyes of prophetesses offering magi withered fingers. one, with floral past enwoven on my gown bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen, an aroma, roses, rising from the hidden couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds, an aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds, a drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon (though the taper’s quenched, petals still fall from one), flowers whose long regrets and stems appear drenched in a lonely vase to languish there… an aurora dragged her wings in the basin’s tears!  magical shadow with symbolic powers! a voice from the distant past, an evocation, is it not mine prepared for incantation? in the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed, lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed, spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold, through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud through which the old veiled brightness is allowed to mount, in desperation, shall arise (but oh, the distance hidden in those cries!) the old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver, of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar: will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor, and, in the hour of its agony, render itself as the anthem for psalms of petition? for all are alike in being brought to perdition by the power of old silence and deepening gloom, fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone, like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond.  sometimes she sang an incoherent song. lamentable sign! the bed of vellum sheets, useless and closed–not linen!—vainly waits, bereft now of the cherished grammary that spelled the figured folds of reverie, the silken tent that harbored memory, the fragrance of sleeping hair. were these its treasure? cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure, shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn, or when the pomegranate’s flesh is torn by wicked night! alone, the crescent moon on the iron clockface is a pendulum suspending lucifer: the clepsydra pours dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours as, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade on undeciphered paths without a guide! all this the king knows not, whose salary has fed so long this ag è d breast now dry. her father knows it no more than the cruel glacier mirroring his arms of steel, when sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens with dark silver trumpets the ancient pines! will he ever come back from the cisalpines? soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding! on the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according to the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns, and to an envious candle it turns a finger. and soon, when the sad sun sinks, it shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks! no sunset, but the red awakening of the last day concluding everything struggles so sadly that time disappears, the redness of apocalypse, whose tears fall on the child, exiled to her own proud heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud for its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away from the plumage of grief to the eternal highway of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!

 p art o ne   the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees. the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas. the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, and the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.  he’d a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, a coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. they fitted with never a wrinkle. his boots were up to the thigh. and he rode with a jewelled twinkle, his pistol butts a-twinkle, his rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard. he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred. he whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.  and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked where tim the ostler listened. his face was white and peaked. his eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay, but he loved the landlord’s daughter, the landlord’s red-lipped daughter. dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—  “one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i’m after a prize to-night, but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day, then look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”  he rose upright in the stirrups. he scarce could reach her hand, but she loosened her hair in the casement. his face burnt like a brand as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; and he kissed its waves in the moonlight, (o, sweet black waves in the moonlight!) then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.  p art t wo   he did not come in the dawning. he did not come at noon; and out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon, when the road was a gypsy’s ribbon, looping the purple moor, a red-coat troop came marching— marching—marching— king george’s men came marching, up to the old inn-door.  they said no word to the landlord. they drank his ale instead. but they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow bed. two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! there was death at every window; and hell at one dark window; for bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.  they had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest. they had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her breast! “now, keep good watch!” and they kissed her. she heard the doomed man say— look for me by moonlight; watch for me by moonlight; i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!  she twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! they stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years till, now, on the stroke of midnight, cold, on the stroke of midnight, the tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!  the tip of one finger touched it. she strove no more for the rest. up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her breast. she would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; for the road lay bare in the moonlight; blank and bare in the moonlight; and the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love’s refrain.  tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horsehoofs ringing clear; tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still.  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence!tlot-tlot, in the echoing night! nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned. he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood! not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear how bess, the landlord’s daughter, the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat; when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  .       .       .  and still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, a highwayman comes riding— riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred. he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

 his mother stepped about her kitchen, complaining in a low voice; all day his father sat stooped at a sewing machine. when he went to high school webber was in his class. webber lived in a neighborhood where the houses are set in lawns with trees beside the gutters. the boys who live there, after school, take their skates and hockey sticks and play in the streets until nightfall. at twelve o’clock the boys ran out of school to a lunchroom around the corner. first come, first served, and they ran as fast as they could. webber would run up beside him and knock him against the wall. he tried not to mind and thought webber would tire of it. one day he hit webber’s side; his fist fell off webber’s over- coat. webber turned with a glad shout and punched him as he cowered. his home was in a neighborhood of workingmen where there were few jews. when he came home from school he walked as quickly as he could, his head bowed and cap pulled low over his face. once, a few blocks from home, a tall lad stopped him. “are you a jew? i knock the block off every jew i meet.” “no,” he answered. “i think you’re a jew. what’s your name?” he told him, glad that his name was not markedly jewish and yet foreign enough to answer for his looks. “where do you live?” he told him and added, “come around any old time and ask about me.” so he got away. when he was through high school he worked in the civil service as a typist, taken on until a rush of business was over. he took the test for a steady job, but his standing on the list was low, unlikely to be reached for a long time, if ever before the new list. looking for work, he always came upon a group waiting for the job. he was short and weak-looking, and looked peevish. he could not get work for months. at last an old german storekeeper wanted to hire him and asked at what he had been working. he told him. “it doesn’t pay me to break you in, if you are going to leave me. have you taken another civil service test? are you waiting for a new appointment?” “no,” he answered. in a few months a letter came to his home from the civil service board, asking him to report for work as a typist, a permanent appointment. there was no hurry, but his father did not know and so brought the letter to the store.  there had been a boy in his class at school whose name was kore. kore was short, too, but he had the chest of an old sailor and thick, bandy legs. he shouted when he spoke and was always laughing. kore moved into the block. with kore he was not afraid to stand on the stoop after work or go walking anywhere. once they went to coney island and kore wanted to go bathing. it was late at night and no one else was in. they went along the beach until they came to the iron pier the steamboats dock at. kore boasted that he would swim around the pier and slid away into the black water. at last the people were gone. the booths were long darkened. he waited for kore at the other side of the pier, watching the empty waves come in.

 —for paul metcalf a linear projection: a route. it crosses the ocean in many ships. arriving in the new land, it cuts through and down forests and it keeps moving. terrain: rock, weaponry. dark trees, mastery. grass, to yield. earth, reproachful. fox, bear, coon, wildcat prowl gloomily, it kills them, it skins them, its language alters, no account varmint, its teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it becomes a snake in the reedy river. spits and prays, keeps moving. behind it, a steel track. cold, permanent. not permanent. it will decay. this does not matter, it does not actually care, murdering the buffalo, driving the laggard regiments, the caring was a necessary myth, an eagle like a speck in heaven dives. the line believes that the entire wrinkled mountain range is the eagle’s nest, and everything tumbles in place. it buries its balls at wounded knee, it rushes gold, it gambles. it buys plastics. another ocean stops it. soon, soon, up by its roots, severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not matter, it decides, perpendicular from here: escape.  a prior circle: a mouth. it is nowhere, everywhere, swollen, warm. expanding and contracting it absorbs and projects children, jungles, black shoes, pennies, blood. it speaks too many dark, suffering languages. reaching a hand toward its throat, you disappear entirely. no wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no wonder.

 first there was some other order of things never spoken but in dreams of darkest creation.  then there was black earth, lake, the face of light on water. then the thick forest all around that light, and then the human clay whose blood we still carry rose up in us who remember caves with red bison painted in their own blood, after their kind.  a wildness swam inside our mothers, desire through closed eyes, a new child wearing the red, wet mask of birth, delivered into this land already wounded, stolen and burned beyond reckoning.  red is this yielding land turned inside out by a country of hunters with iron, flint and fire. red is the fear that turns a knife back against men, holds it at their throats, and they cannot see the claw on the handle, the animal hand that haunts them from some place inside their blood.  so that is hunting, birth, and one kind of death. then there was medicine, the healing of wounds. red was the infinite fruit of stolen bodies. the doctors wanted to know what invented disease how wounds healed from inside themselves how life stands up in skin, if not by magic.  they divined the red shadows of leeches that swam in white bowls of water: they believed stars in the cup of sky. they cut the wall of skin to let what was bad escape but they were reading the story of fire gone out and that was a science.  as for the animal hand on death’s knife, knives have as many sides as the red father of war who signs his name in the blood of other men.  and red was the soldier who crawled through a ditch of human blood in order to live. it was the canal of his deliverance. it is his son who lives near me. red is the thunder in our ears when we meet. love, like creation, is some other order of things.  red is the share of fire i have stolen from root, hoof, fallen fruit. and this was hunger.  red is the human house i come back to at night swimming inside the cave of skin that remembers bison. in that round nation of blood we are all burning, red, inseparable fires the living have crawled and climbed through in order to live so nothing will be left for death at the end.  this life in the fire, i love it. i want it, this life.

 it's 70 degrees outside but in the drugstore christmas music plays over the speakers as i stand in line balancing my checkbook in my head, stretching things thin until my next paycheck when the rent is due. the security guard cracks a joke, but i wasn't paying attention, so i just smile &amp; step forward in line. images move across the screen. when i think about money it seems impossible. all over the country people are moving into the streets &amp; we're here in atlanta starting a new life. darkness surrounds the latest revision of our shared history. everything clouded. yesterday 1 couldn't tear myself from the news &amp; already today the events have been distorted, the numbers downplayed. it's late fall &amp; in the early morning crispness, the leaves fall from the trees &amp; cover the sidewalks. this new feeling we lack a name for, struggle manifested in the streets &amp; in parks &amp; on bridges across the nation. the headlines read "protesters clash with police," but as we watched the live stream, we saw aggression only by officers dressed in riot gear. we saw people tossed on the ground, hit with batons, a woman punched in the face, an eighty-four year old woman's face drenched in pepper spray. the images endless in this land of the free. i'm losing focus, distracted by the newsfeed on the computer screen, hitting refresh. the cat paws at my leg, demands its own attention. this shift entirely unexpected but necessary. leaves blot the window. every so often i leave &amp; start from scratch, imagine damaged relationships &amp; sick cities where there was no damage &amp; no sickness greater than anywhere else. in atlanta, everyone drives. the bartender called us "hardcore" when we said we'd walked there. she said, "no one in atlanta walks anywhere." walking home from work in post-daylight savings time darkness i pass no one on the sidewalks. i pass the traffic backed up by the stoplight. the weekend passes too quickly— i wish it would last longer, which is what this all is really about: time &amp; my lack of control over it, my inability to do what i want with it. and there's a greater futility at work here too—a greater frustration in my inability to control my environment or to stop my country from killing its citizens. the police beat people standing still, linking arms, holding cardboard signs. each day i think more &amp; more about the past, about where things began to go wrong, where i, too, began to go wrong. before i moved, before i got sick, before i unfriended you on facebook, before i decided i no longer loved you, before new york, before college—thinking back to childhood when we could run fearless through the neighborhood at night, when we didn't think about the future, when we loved our country because we didn't know better.

 in indianapolis they drive five hundred miles and end up where they started: survival of the fittest. in the swamps of auburn and elkhart, in the jungles of south bend, one-cylinder chain-driven runabouts fall to air-cooled v-4’s, a-speed gearboxes, 16-horse flat-twin midships engines— carcasses left behind by monobloc motors, electric starters, 3-speed gears, six cylinders, 2-chain drive, overhead cams, supercharged to 88 miles an hour in second gear, the age of leviathan ... there is grandeur in this view of life, as endless forms most beautiful and wonderful are being evolved.

 it was like soul-kissing, the way the words filled my mouth as mrs. purdy read from her desk. all the other kids zoned an hour ahead to 3:15, but mrs. purdy and i wandered lonely as clouds borne by a breeze off mount parnassus. she must have seen the darkest eyes in the room brim: the next day she gave me a poem she’d chosen especially for me to read to the all except for me white class. she smiled when she told me to read it, smiled harder, said oh yes i could. she smiled harder and harder until i stood and opened my mouth to banjo playing darkies, pickaninnies, disses and dats. when i finished my classmates stared at the floor. we walked silent to the buses, awed by the power of words.

 everything is perfect, dear friend. — kerouac get some sleep.  don't give advice.  take care of your teeth and gums.  don't be afraid of anything beyond your control. don't be afraid, for instance, that the building will collapse as you sleep, or that someone you love will suddenly drop dead.  eat an orange every morning.  be friendly. it will help make you happy.  raise your pulse rate to 120 beats per minute for 20 straight minutes four or five times a week doing anything you enjoy.  hope for everything. expect nothing.  take care of things close to home first. straighten up your room before you save the world. then save the world.  know that the desire to be perfect is probably the veiled expression of another desire—to be loved, perhaps, or not to die.  make eye contact with a tree.  be skeptical about all opinions, but try to see some value in each of them.  dress in a way that pleases both you and those around you.  do not speak quickly.  learn something every day. (dzien dobre!)  be nice to people before they have a chance to behave badly.  don't stay angry about anything for more than a week, but don't forget what made you angry. hold your anger out at arm's length and look at it, as if it were a glass ball. then add it to your glass ball collection.  be loyal.  wear comfortable shoes.  design your activities so that they show a pleasing balance and variety.  be kind to old people, even when they are obnoxious. when you become old, be kind to young people. do not throw your cane at them when they call you grandpa. they are your grandchildren!  live with an animal.  do not spend too much time with large groups of people.  if you need help, ask for it.  cultivate good posture until it becomes natural.  if someone murders your child, get a shotgun and blow his head off.  plan your day so you never have to rush.  show your appreciation to people who do things for you, even if you have paid them, even if they do favors you don't want.  do not waste money you could be giving to those who need it.  expect society to be defective. then weep when you find that it is far more defective than you imagined.  when you borrow something, return it in an even better condition.  as much as possible, use wooden objects instead of plastic or metal ones.  look at that bird over there.  after dinner, wash the dishes.  calm down.  visit foreign countries, except those whose inhabitants have expressed a desire to kill you.  don't expect your children to love you, so they can, if they want to.  meditate on the spiritual. then go a little further, if you feel like it. what is out (in) there?  sing, every once in a while.  be on time, but if you are late do not give a detailed and lengthy excuse.  don't be too self-critical or too self-congratulatory.  don't think that progress exists. it doesn't.  walk upstairs.  do not practice cannibalism.  imagine what you would like to see happen, and then don't do anything to make it impossible.  take your phone off the hook at least twice a week.  keep your windows clean.  extirpate all traces of personal ambitiousness.  don't use the word extirpate too often.  forgive your country every once in a while. if that is not possible, go to another one.  if you feel tired, rest.  grow something.  do not wander through train stations muttering, "we're all going to die!"  count among your true friends people of various stations of life.  appreciate simple pleasures, such as the pleasure of chewing, the pleasure of warm water running down your back, the pleasure of a cool breeze, the pleasure of falling asleep.  do not exclaim, "isn't technology wonderful!"  learn how to stretch your muscles. stretch them every day.  don't be depressed about growing older. it will make you feel even older. which is depressing.  do one thing at a time.  if you burn your finger, put it in cold water immediately. if you bang your finger with a hammer, hold your hand in the air for twenty minutes. you will be surprised by the curative powers of coldness and gravity.  learn how to whistle at earsplitting volume.  be calm in a crisis. the more critical the situation, the calmer you should be.  enjoy sex, but don't become obsessed with it. except for brief periods in your adolescence, youth, middle age, and old age.  contemplate everything's opposite.  if you're struck with the fear that you've swum out too far in the ocean, turn around and go back to the lifeboat.  keep your childish self alive.  answer letters promptly. use attractive stamps, like the one with a tornado on it.  cry every once in a while, but only when alone. then appreciate how much better you feel. don't be embarrassed about feeling better.  do not inhale smoke.  take a deep breath.  do not smart off to a policeman.  do not step off the curb until you can walk all the way across the street. from the curb you can study the pedestrians who are trapped in the middle of the crazed and roaring traffic.  be good.  walk down different streets.  backwards.  remember beauty, which exists, and truth, which does not. notice that the idea of truth is just as powerful as the idea of beauty.  stay out of jail.  in later life, become a mystic.  use colgate toothpaste in the new tartar control formula.  visit friends and acquaintances in the hospital. when you feel it is time to leave, do so.  be honest with yourself, diplomatic with others.  do not go crazy a lot. it's a waste of time.  read and reread great books.  dig a hole with a shovel.  in winter, before you go to bed, humidify your bedroom.  know that the only perfect things are a 300 game in bowling and a 27-batter, 27-out game in baseball.  drink plenty of water. when asked what you would like to drink, say, "water, please."  ask "where is the loo?" but not "where can i urinate?"  be kind to physical objects.  beginning at age forty, get a complete "physical" every few years from a doctor you trust and feel comfortable with.  don't read the newspaper more than once a year.  learn how to say "hello," "thank you," and "chopsticks" in mandarin.  belch and fart, but quietly.  be especially cordial to foreigners.  see shadow puppet plays and imagine that you are one of the characters. or all of them.  take out the trash.  love life.  use exact change.  when there's shooting in the street, don't go near the window.

 turn left off henry onto middagh street to see our famous firehouse, home of engine 205 and  hook &amp; ladder 118 and home also to the mythic painting “fire under the bridge” decorating  the corrugated sliding door. the painting depicts a giant american flag wrinkled by wind  and dwarfing the famous brooklyn bridge as it stretches as best it can to get a purchase  on manhattan. in the distance a few dismal towers and beyond the towers still another river.  a little deal table holds a tiny american flag—like the one foreman held as he bowed to  receive gold at the ’68 olympics in mexico city—; this actual flag is rooted in a can of hothouse  roses going brown at the edges and beginning to shed. there’s a metal collection box bearing the  names of those lost during the recent burnings. should you stop to shake the box— which is none  of your business—you’ll hear only a whisper. perhaps the donations are all hush money,  ones, fives, tens, twenties, or more likely there are ious and the heart of brooklyn  has gone cold from so much asking. down the block and across the street, a man  sleeps on the sidewalk, an ordinary man, somehow utterly spent, he sleeps through  all the usual sounds of a brooklyn noon. beside him a dog, a terrier, its muzzle resting  on crossed paws, its brown eyes wide and intelligent. between man and dog sits  a take-out coffee cup meant to receive, next to it a picture of jesus— actually  a digital, color photograph of the lord in his prime, robed and though bearded  impossibly young and athletic, and— as always—alone. “give what you can,”  says a hand-lettered cardboard sign to all who pass. if you stand there long enough  without giving or receiving the shabby, little terrier will close his eyes. if you stand  there long enough the air will thicken with dusk and dust and exhaust and finally with  a starless dark. the day will become something it’s never been before, something for which i have no name.

 when i fall into the abyss, i go straight into it, head down and heels up, and i'm even pleased that i'm falling in just such a humiliating position, and for me i find it beautiful. and so in that very shame i suddenly begin a hymn. —fyodor dostoevsky i traveled to the page where scripture meets fiction. the paper slept but the night in me woke up.  black letters were now alive and collectible in a material crawl.  i could not decipher their intentions anymore. to what end did their shapes come forth?  to seduce or speak truth?  while birds swept over the water like pot-bellied angels  beautiful bells rang to assist the hoist.  up they went to slake their thirst, drinking from the mist  for the sound of bells seemed to free as well as hold them.  then down to scavenge the surf and eat the innocent.  “i love god and the ferry too,” wrote kerouac.  only that which exists can be spoken of.   *     *     *   i wonder, will our imagination remain a temple burning with candles  against all odds? behind a nipple and a bone?  the simplest of glands laid in a circle around skin and liquid  that stirs up imagery winged and prismed, as if blood  were a wine inducing visions  *     *     *    some people cry when the characters die.  then they kill themselves offstage, away from the pages that they are turning in the night.  some people sacrifice themselves on a whim and regret it later on paper.  now i see you in the window. are you in the book i was looking for?  the one who traveled back to the happy days  when she could jump on a moving bus and swing in the open air  clutching a worn novel in her purse . . . ? a curtain, a knife, adoring eyes?  *     *     *   i watched the children running and turned to alyosha for a blessing.  he was sunk in the morass of rural life  i like to sit with him in the grass.  then we see the same thing at the same time, and are one mind.  we two masses, one a book, one a hand.  when alyosha spoke to the boys at the end i anticipated their next question and his answer  for they formed a single gesture of kindness.  “will we?” “we will.”  *     *     *   it seemed evil to read about people we would never meet. we tested their fortitude as if in sleep. they generally failed the challenge being strangers in a strange brain.  they were baffled by the tools handed to them and by the traffic’s direction. frankly in a dream or story, the goal is absolutely hidden from the one to whom it matters.  *     *     *   eons of lily-building emerged in that one flower. eons, eons. pins and wool, thread and needle, all material made of itself and circumstance.  it was a terrible century: consisting of blasted oil refineries and stuck ducks, fish with their lips sealed by plastic and tar in the hair of cooks. filth had penetrated the vents.  institutions moan. balls of used cotton from the hospital dumpster, redden. yawning on obsolescence the computer wonders  who punched in such poor grammar. first-padded virgins graduate to this suffering drama all by her-selves. who once were cells.  *     *     *   history is more than just another surmising grandmother at a window or a reminiscence twisted in the scrim of translation.  some long-ago light is pulsating in a trout’s heart on a laboratory dish.  that light has entered all the holes, no matter how small, because it is the light that wants to live.  *     *     *   still waiting for you my sunshine of justice and mercy.  if west is east of moscow, depending where you’re going  then will you ever find me coming from a northerly direction?  are you even looking at the earth? remember the map is flat but everything else is not.  is the newest child the oldest body in creation?  does he carry more information than his mother?  does her mother, his grandmother, do i seem redundant by having arrived with less, though first?  is that why i read at night with my lips compressed?  *     *     *   the fact is, i never knew if anyone felt me the way nijinsky knew how to feel.  or nastasya. nothing could shock that woman who had done so much wrong.  as if trained in a theater, multiple personalities streamed from her tongue.  this made her an exemplar for our time.  she knew how others felt and became each one, forgetting who she was before.  i remember her as a child.  her skirt got tangled up in a thorn bush when she watched the sky.  shaking herself free, she had to see the spiders, ants and dirt around her skirt,  it was like peering into her own body and she screamed in horror.  later, consolation would be extended by a man dark and handsome:  it came with his semen (when she wanted hibernation).  she didn’t commit suicide this time, but ran down nevsky prospekt as it began to rain,  and paused to lift her umbrella. for this moment  we were in our soul a child rushing home to granny five floors up.  *     *     *   i dropped the book, wept and went to the movies.  it is here where i can forgive someone for his crime.  poisoning babies for profit. harry lime.  i can actually forgive it when he is crawling in shit.  otherwise we will stand on the ferris wheel together forever stuck in the fog and iron.  i just a witness to his ironic story  he will be a mix between paul celan and oscar levant when we are at our happiest and no forgiveness is asked.  neurotic, pale, and drawn to the canals, we will lean over the embankment like sister and brother  who are tempted to be actors.  it is here that his shoes and cat will converge in the dark. like fish in a secular city  flipping through sewers for a flash of christ.  
NEW POEM
 the wind rests its cheek upon the ground and feels the cool damp and lifts its head with twigs and small dead blades of grass pressed into it as you might at the beach rise up and brush away the sand. the day is cool and says, “i’m just staying overnight.” the world is filled with music, and in between the music, silence and varying the silence all sorts of sounds, natural and man made: there goes a plane, some cars, geese that honk and, not here, but not so far away, a scream so rending that to hear it is to be never again the same. “why, this is hell.” out of the death breeding soil, here, rise emblems of innocence, snowdrops that struggle easily into life and hang their white enamel heads toward the dirt and in the yellow grass are small wild crocuses from hills goats have cropped to barrenness. the corms come by mail, are planted. then do their thing: to live! to live! so natural and so hard hard as it seems it must be for green spears to pierce the all but frozen mold and insist that they too, like mouse-eared chickweed, will live. the spears lengthen, the bud appears and spreads, its seed capsule fattens and falls, the green turns yellowish and withers stretched upon the ground. in washington, magnolias were in bud. in charlottesville early bulbs were up, brightening the muck. tomorrow will begin another spring. no one gets many, one at a time, like a long awaited letter that one day comes. but it may not say what you hoped or distraction robs it of what it once would have meant. spring comes and the winter weather, here, may hold. it is arbitrary, like the plan of washington, d.c. avenues and circles in asphalt web and no one gets younger: which is not, for the young, true, discovering new freedoms at twenty, a relief not to be a teen-ager anymore. one of us had piles, another water on the knee, a third a hernia—a strangulated hernia is one of life’s less pleasant bits of news—and only one, at twenty, moved easily through all the galleries to pill free sleep. oh, it’s not all that bad. the sun shines on my hand and the myriad lines that criss-cross tell the story of nearly fifty years. sorry, it’s too long to relate. once, when i was young, i awoke at first light and sitting in a rocking chair watched the sun come up beyond the houses across the street. another time i stood at the cables of a liner and watched the wake turning and turning upon itself. another time i woke up and in a bottle on a chest of drawers the thoughtful doctor had left my tonsils. i didn’t keep them. the turning of the globe is not so real to us as the seasons turning and the days that rise out of early gray —the world is all cut-outs then—and slip or step steadily down the slopes of our lives where the emotions and needs sprout. “i need you,” tree, that dominates this yard, thick-waisted, tall and crook branched. its bark scales off like that which we forget: pain, an introduction at a party, what precisely happened umpteen years or days or hours ago. and that same blue jay returns, or perhaps it is another. all jays are one to me. but not the sun which seems at each rising new, as though in the night it enacted death and rebirth, as flowers seem to. the roses this june will be different roses even though you cut an armful and come in saying, “here are the roses,” as though the same blooms had come back, white freaked with red and heavily scented. or a cut branch of pear blooms before its time, “forced.” time brings us into bloom and we wait, busy, but wait for the unforced flow of words and intercourse and sleep and dreams in which the past seems to portend a future which is just more daily life. the cat has a ripped ear. he fights, he fights all the tom cats all the time. there are blood gouts on a velvet seat. easily sponged off: but these red drops on a book of stifter’s, will i remember and say at some future time, “oh, yes, that was the day hodge had a torn ear and bled on the card table?” poor hodge, battered like an old car. silence flows into my mind. it is spring. it is also still really winter. not a day when you say, “what a beautiful spring day.” a day like twilight or evening when you think, “i meant to watch the sun set.” and then comes on to rain. “you’ve got to take,” says the man at the store, “the rough with the smooth.” a window to the south is rough with raindrops that, caught in the screen, spell out untranslatable glyphs. a story not told: so much not understood, a sight, an insight, and you pass on, another day for each day is subjective and there is a totality of days as there are as many to live it. the day lives us and in exchange we it: after snowball time, a month, march, of fits and starts, winds, rain, spring hints and wintry arrears. the weather pays its check, like quarreling in a d.c. hotel, “i won’t quarrel about it, but i made no local calls.” strange city, broad and desolating, monuments rearing up and offices like monuments and crowds lined up to see the white house inside. “we went to see the white house.   it was lovely.” not so strange though as the cemetery with guttering flame and admirals and generals with bigger gravestones than the lesser fry below lee’s house, false marble pillars and inside all so everyday, in every room a shawl tossed untidily upon a chair or bed created no illusion of lived-in-ness. but the periwinkles do, in beds that flatten and are starred blue-violet, a retiring flower loved, it would seem, of the dead, so often found where they congregate. a quote from aeschylus: i forget. all, all is forgotten gradually and one wonders if these ideas that seem handed down are truly what they were? an idea may mutate like a plant, and what was once held basic truth become an idle thought. like, “shall we plant some periwinkles there by that bush? they’re so to be depended on.” the wind shakes the screen and all the raindrops on it streak and run in stems. it’s colder. the crocuses close up. the snowdrops are brushed with mud. the sky colors itself rosily behind gray-black and the rain falls through the basketball hoop on a garage, streaking its backboard with further trails of rust, a lovely color to set with periwinkle violet-blue. and the trees shiver and shudder in the light rain blasts from off the ocean. the street wet reflects the breakup of the clouds on its face, driving over sky with a hissing sound. the car slides slightly and in the west appear streaks of different green: a lid lifted briefly on the spring. then the moon burns through racing clouds, its aureole that of rings of oil on water in a harbor bubbling up from an exhaust. clear the sky. beside a rim of moon. three stars and only three and one planet. so under lilacs unleaved lie a clump of snowdrops and one purple crocus. purple. a polka-dotted color little girls are fond of: “see my new dess!” and she twirls on one foot. then, crossed, bursts into tears. smiles and rain, like these passing days in which buds swell, unseen as yet, waiting for the elms to color their further out most twigs, only the willow gleams yellow. life is hard. some are strong, some weak, most untested. these useless truths blow about the yard the day after rain the soft sunlight making softer shadows on the faded lawn. the world looks so old in the spring, laid out under the sky. one gull coasts by, unexpected as a kiss on the nape of the neck. these days need birds and so they come, a flock of ducks, and a bunch of small fluffy unnamed balls that hide in hedges and make a racket. “the gift of life,” as though, existing in expectancy and then someone came up and said, “here,” or, “happy birthday.” it is more mysterious than that, pierced by blue or running in the rain or simply lying down to read. writing a postponed letter which may bring no pleasure: arduous truths to tell. and if you thought march was bad consider april, early april, wet snow falling into blue squills that underneath a beech make an illusory lake, a haze of blue with depth to it. that is like pain, ordinary household pain, like piles, or bumping against a hernia. all the signs are set for a ok a day to visit the national gallery—velázquez, degas—but, and what a but, with water on the knee “you’ll need a wheelchair, mummy.” coasting among the masterpieces, of what use are they?angel with a hurdy-gurdy

 love, thou are absolute sole lord of life and death. to prove the word, we’ll now appeal to none of all those thy old soldiers, great and tall, ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down with strong arms their triumphant crown; such as could with lusty breath speak loud into the face of death their great lord’s glorious name; to none of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne for love at large to fill; spare blood and sweat, and see him take a private seat, making his mansion in the mild and milky soul of a soft child.  scarce has she learn’d to lisp the name of martyr, yet she thinks it shame life should so long play with that breath which spent can buy so brave a death. she never undertook to know what death with love should have to do; nor has she e’er yet understood why to show love she should shed blood; yet though she cannot tell you why, she can love, and she can die.  scarce has she blood enough to make a guilty sword blush for her sake; yet has she’a heart dares hope to prove how much less strong is death than love.  be love but there, let poor six years be pos’d with the maturest fears man trembles at, you straight shall find love knows no nonage, nor the mind. ’tis love, not years or limbs that can make the martyr, or the man.  love touch’d her heart, and lo it beats high, and burns with such brave heats, such thirsts to die, as dares drink up a thousand cold deaths in one cup. good reason, for she breathes all fire; her weak breast heaves with strong desire of what she may with fruitless wishes seek for amongst her mother’s kisses.  since ’tis not to be had at home, she’ll travel to a martyrdom. no home for hers confesses she but where she may a martyr be.  she’ll to the moors, and trade with them for this unvalued diadem. she’ll offer them her dearest breath, with christ’s name in ’t, in change for death. she’ll bargain with them, and will give them god; teach them how to live in him; or, if they this deny, for him she’ll teach them how to die. so shall she leave amongst them sown her lord’s blood, or at least her own.  farewell then, all the world, adieu! teresa is no more for you. farewell, all pleasures, sports, and joys, (never till now esteemed toys) farewell, whatever dear may be, mother’s arms or father’s knee, farewell house and farewell home, she’s for the moors, and martyrdom!  sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair spouse, whom thou seek’st with so swift vows, calls thee back, and bids thee come t’ embrace a milder martyrdom.  blest powers forbid thy tender life should bleed upon a barbarous knife; or some base hand have power to rase thy breast’s chaste cabinet, and uncase a soul kept there so sweet; oh no, wise heav’n will never have it so; thou art love’s victim, and must die a death more mystical and high; into love’s arms thou shalt let fall a still-surviving funeral. he is the dart must make the death whose stroke shall taste thy hallow’d breath; a dart thrice dipp’d in that rich flame which writes thy spouse’s radiant name upon the roof of heav’n, where aye it shines, and with a sovereign ray beats bright upon the burning faces of souls, which in that name’s sweet graces find everlasting smiles. so rare, so spiritual, pure, and fair must be th’ immortal instrument upon whose choice point shall be sent a life so lov’d; and that there be fit executioners for thee, the fair’st and first-born sons of fire, blest seraphim, shall leave their quire and turn love’s soldiers, upon thee to exercise their archery.  oh, how oft shalt thou complain of a sweet and subtle pain, of intolerable joys, of a death in which who dies loves his death, and dies again, and would forever so be slain, and lives and dies, and knows not why to live, but that he thus may never leave to die.  how kindly will thy gentle heart kiss the sweetly-killing dart! and close in his embraces keep those delicious wounds, that weep balsam to heal themselves with. thus when these thy deaths, so numerous, shall all at last die into one, and melt thy soul’s sweet mansion like a soft lump of incense, hasted by too hot a fire, and wasted into perfuming clouds, so fast shalt thou exhale to heav’n at last in a resolving sigh; and then, o what? ask not the tongues of men; angels cannot tell; suffice, thyself shall feel thine own full joys and hold them fast forever. there so soon as thou shalt first appear, the moon of maiden stars, thy white mistress, attended by such bright souls as thy shining self, shall come and in her first ranks make thee room; where ’mongst her snowy family immortal welcomes wait for thee.  o what delight, when reveal’d life shall stand and teach thy lips heav’n with his hand, on which thou now mayst to thy wishes heap up thy consecrated kisses. what joys shall seize thy soul when she, bending her blessed eyes on thee, (those second smiles of heav’n) shall dart her mild rays through thy melting heart!  angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee, glad at their own home now to meet thee.  all thy good works which went before and waited for thee, at the door, shall own thee there, and all in one weave a constellation of crowns, with which the king, thy spouse, shall build up thy triumphant brows.  all thy old woes shall now smile on thee, and thy pains sit bright upon thee; all thy sorrows here shall shine, all thy suff’rings be divine; tears shall take comfort and turn gems, and wrongs repent to diadems. ev’n thy deaths shall live, and new dress the soul that erst they slew; thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars as keep account of the lamb’s wars.  those rare works where thou shalt leave writ love’s noble history, with wit taught thee by none but him, while here they feed our souls, shall clothe thine there. each heav’nly word by whose hid flame our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same shall flourish on thy brows, and be both fire to us and flame to thee, whose light shall live bright in thy face by glory, in our hearts by grace.  thou shalt look round about and see thousands of crown’d souls throng to be themselves thy crown; sons of thy vows, the virgin-births with which thy sovereign spouse made fruitful thy fair soul, go now and with them all about thee, bow to him. “put on,” he’ll say, “put on, my rosy love, that thy rich zone sparkling with the sacred flames of thousand souls whose happy names heav’n keeps upon thy score. thy bright life brought them first to kiss the light that kindled them to stars.” and so thou with the lamb, thy lord, shalt go, and wheresoe’er he sets his white steps, walk with him those ways of light which who in death would live to see must learn in life to die like thee.

 (excerpt) book i  deep in the shady sadness of a vale far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star, sat gray-hair'd saturn, quiet as a stone, still as the silence round about his lair; forest on forest hung about his head like cloud on cloud. no stir of air was there, not so much life as on a summer's day robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, but where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. a stream went voiceless by, still deadened more by reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade: the naiad 'mid her reeds press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.  along the margin-sand large foot-marks went, no further than to where his feet had stray'd, and slept there since. upon the sodden ground his old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed; while his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the earth, his ancient mother, for some comfort yet.  it seem'd no force could wake him from his place; but there came one, who with a kindred hand touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low with reverence, though to one who knew it not. she was a goddess of the infant world; by her in stature the tall amazon had stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en achilles by the hair and bent his neck; or with a finger stay'd ixion's wheel. her face was large as that of memphian sphinx, pedestal'd haply in a palace court, when sages look'd to egypt for their lore. but oh! how unlike marble was that face: how beautiful, if sorrow had not made sorrow more beautiful than beauty's self. there was a listening fear in her regard, as if calamity had but begun; as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice, and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up. one hand she press'd upon that aching spot where beats the human heart, as if just there, though an immortal, she felt cruel pain: the other upon saturn's bended neck she laid, and to the level of his ear leaning with parted lips, some words she spake in solemn tenour and deep organ tone: some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue would come in these like accents; o how frail to that large utterance of the early gods! "saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old king? i have no comfort for thee, no not one: i cannot say, "o wherefore sleepest thou?" for heaven is parted from thee, and the earth knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a god; and ocean too, with all its solemn noise, has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty. thy thunder, conscious of the new command, rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; and thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain. o aching time! o moments big as years! all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe. saturn, sleep on:—o thoughtless, why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude? why should i ope thy melancholy eyes? saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet i weep."  as when, upon a tranced summer-night, those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, dream, and so dream all night without a stir, save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence, and dies off, as if the ebbing air had but one wave; so came these words and went; the while in tears she touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturn's feet. one moon, with alteration slow, had shed her silver seasons four upon the night, and still these two were postured motionless, like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; the frozen god still couchant on the earth, and the sad goddess weeping at his feet: until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, and all the gloom and sorrow of the place, and that fair kneeling goddess; and then spake, as with a palsied tongue, and while his beard shook horrid with such aspen-malady: "o tender spouse of gold hyperion, thea, i feel thee ere i see thy face; look up, and let me see our doom in it; look up, and tell me if this feeble shape is saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice of saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, naked and bare of its great diadem, peers like the front of saturn. who had power to make me desolate? whence came the strength? how was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth, while fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp? but it is so, and i am smother'd up, and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale, of admonitions to the winds and seas, of peaceful sway above man's harvesting, and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love in.—i am gone away from my own bosom: i have left my strong identity, my real self, somewhere between the throne, and where i sit here on this spot of earth. search, thea, search! open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light; space region'd with life-air; and barren void; spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.— search, thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest a certain shape or shadow, making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must be of ripe progress—saturn must be king. yes, there must be a golden victory; there must be gods thrown down, and trumpets blown of triumph calm, and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan, voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be beautiful things made new, for the surprise of the sky-children; i will give command: thea! thea! thea! where is saturn?"  this passion lifted him upon his feet, and made his hands to struggle in the air, his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, his eyes to fever out, his voice to cease. he stood, and heard not thea's sobbing deep; a little time, and then again he snatch'd utterance thus.—"but cannot i create? cannot i form? cannot i fashion forth another world, another universe, to overbear and crumble this to nought? where is another chaos? where?"—that word found way unto olympus, and made quake the rebel three.—thea was startled up, and in her bearing was a sort of hope, as thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. "this cheers our fallen house: come to our friends, o saturn! come away, and give them heart; i know the covert, from thence came i hither." thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space: he follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.  meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, more sorrow like to this, and such like woe, too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: the titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound, groan'd for the old allegiance once more, and listen'd in sharp pain for saturn's voice. but one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept his sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;— blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up from man to the sun's god; yet unsecure: for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex, so also shuddered he— not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech, or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell, or prophesyings of the midnight lamp; but horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve, oft made hyperion ache. his palace bright bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, and touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts, arches, and domes, and fiery galleries; and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings, unseen before by gods or wondering men, darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard, not heard before by gods or wondering men. also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills, instead of sweets, his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: and so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, after the full completion of fair day,— for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody, he pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal, on from hall to hall; while far within each aisle and deep recess, his winged minions in close clusters stood, amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops, when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. even now, while saturn, rous'd from icy trance, went step for step with thea through the woods, hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, came slope upon the threshold of the west; then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope in smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, blown by the serious zephyrs, gave of sweet and wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies; and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape, in fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown, for the god to enter in.  he enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath; his flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, and gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, that scar'd away the meek ethereal hours and made their dove-wings tremble. on he flared, from stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light, and diamond-paved lustrous long arcades, until he reach'd the great main cupola; there standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot, and from the basements deep to the high towers jarr'd his own golden region; and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd, his voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, to this result: "o dreams of day and night! o monstrous forms! o effigies of pain! o spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom! o lank-ear'd phantoms of black-weeded pools! why do i know ye? why have i seen ye? why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new? saturn is fallen, am i too to fall? am i to leave this haven of my rest, this cradle of my glory, this soft clime, this calm luxuriance of blissful light, these crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, of all my lucent empire? it is left deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. the blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry, i cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness. even here, into my centre of repose, the shady visions come to domineer, insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.— fall!—no, by tellus and her briny robes! over the fiery frontier of my realms i will advance a terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel jove, and bid old saturn take his throne again."— he spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth; for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out "hush!" so at hyperion's words the phantoms pale bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold; and from the mirror'd level where he stood a mist arose, as from a scummy marsh. at this, through all his bulk an agony crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd from over-strained might. releas'd, he fled to the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush, he breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals, clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams. the planet orb of fire, whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through, spun round in sable curtaining of clouds; nor therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, but ever and anon the glancing spheres, circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old which sages and keen-ey'd astrologers then living on the earth, with labouring thought won from the gaze of many centuries: now lost, save what we find on remnants huge of stone, or marble swart; their import gone, their wisdom long since fled.—two wings this orb possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings, ever exalted at the god's approach: and now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were; while still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse, awaiting for hyperion's command. fain would he have commanded, fain took throne and bid the day begin, if but for change. he might not:—no, though a primeval god: the sacred seasons might not be disturb'd. therefore the operations of the dawn stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told. those silver wings expanded sisterly, eager to sail their orb; the porches wide open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night; and the bright titan, phrenzied with new woes, unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent his spirit to the sorrow of the time; and all along a dismal rack of clouds, upon the boundaries of day and night, he stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint. there as he lay, the heaven with its stars look'd down on him with pity, and the voice of coelus, from the universal space, thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear. "o brightest of my children dear, earth-born and sky-engendered, son of mysteries all unrevealed even to the powers which met at thy creating; at whose joys and palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, i, c{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and whence; and at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, distinct, and visible; symbols divine, manifestations of that beauteous life diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space: of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child! of these, thy brethren and the goddesses! there is sad feud among ye, and rebellion of son against his sire. i saw him fall, i saw my first-born tumbled from his throne! to me his arms were spread, to me his voice found way from forth the thunders round his head! pale wox i, and in vapours hid my face art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is: for i have seen my sons most unlike gods. divine ye were created, and divine in sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, unruffled, like high gods, ye liv'd and ruled: now i behold in you fear, hope, and wrath; actions of rage and passion; even as i see them, on the mortal world beneath, in men who die.—this is the grief, o son! sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall! yet do thou strive; as thou art capable, as thou canst move about, an evident god; and canst oppose to each malignant hour ethereal presence:—i am but a voice; my life is but the life of winds and tides, no more than winds and tides can i avail:— but thou canst.—be thou therefore in the van of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb before the tense string murmur.—to the earth! for there thou wilt find saturn and his woes. meanwhile i will keep watch on thy bright sun, and of thy seasons be a careful nurse."— ere half this region-whisper had come down, hyperion arose, and on the stars lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide: and still they were the same bright, patient stars. then with a slow incline of his broad breast, like to a diver in the pearly seas, forward he stoop'd over the airy shore, and plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.

 mon semblable, mon frère (1) our epoch takes a voluptuous satisfaction in that perspective of the action which pictures us inhabiting the end of everything with death for only friend.  not that we love death, not truly, not the fluttering breath, the obscene shudder of the finished act— what the doe feels when the ultimate fact tears at her bowels with its jaws.  our taste is for the opulent pause before the end comes. if the end is certain all of us are players at the final curtain: all of us, silence for a time deferred, find time before us for one sad last word. victim, rebel, convert, stoic— every role but the heroic— we turn our tragic faces to the stalls to wince our moment till the curtain falls.  (2) a world ends when its metaphor has died.  an age becomes an age, all else beside, when sensuous poets in their pride invent emblems for the soul’s consent that speak the meanings men will never know but man-imagined images can show: it perishes when those images, though seen, no longer mean.  (3) a world was ended when the womb where girl held god became the tomb where god lies buried in a man: botticelli’s image neither speaks nor can to our kind. his star-guided stranger teaches no longer, by the child, the manger, the meaning of the beckoning skies.  sophocles, when his reverent actors rise to play the king with bleeding eyes, no longer shows us on the stage advance god’s purpose in the terrible fatality of chance.  no woman living, when the girl and swan embrace in verses, feels upon her breast the awful thunder of that breast where god, made beast, is by the blood confessed.  empty as conch shell by the waters cast the metaphor still sounds but cannot tell, and we, like parasite crabs, put on the shell and drag it at the sea’s edge up and down.  this is the destiny we say we own.  (4) but are we sure the age that dies upon its metaphor among these roman heads, these mediaeval towers, is ours?— or ours the ending of that story? the meanings in a man that quarry images from blinded eyes and white birds and the turning skies to make a world of were not spent with these abandoned presences.  the journey of our history has not ceased: earth turns us still toward the rising east, the metaphor still struggles in the stone, the allegory of the flesh and bone still stares into the summer grass that is its glass, the ignorant blood still knocks at silence to be understood.  poets, deserted by the world before, turn round into the actual air: invent the age! invent the metaphor!

 for ana menendez it only takes one night with the wind on its knees to imagine carl sandburg unfolding a map of chicago, puzzled, then walking the wrong way.  the lines on his face are hard to read. i alternate between the tv, where a plastic surgeon is claiming that every facial expression causes wrinkles, and  the newspaper. i picture the surgeon reading the lines on sandburg’s face, lines that would’ve made more sense if the poet had been, say, a tree growing  in a wind orchard. maybe he simply smiled too much. i’m reading about the all-star game, thinking that maybe sandburg saw the white sox of 1919.  . . .   i love american newspapers, the way each section is folded independently and believes it owns the world. there’s this brief item in the inter-  national pages: the chinese government has posted signs in tiananmen square, forbidding laughter. i’m sure the plastic surgeon would approve, he’d say  the chinese will look young much longer, their faces unnaturally smooth, but what i see (although no photograph accompanies the story) is laughter  bursting inside them. i go back to the sports section and a closeup of a rookie in mid-swing, his face keeping all the wrong emotions in check. . . .   when i read i bite my lower lip, a habit the plastic surgeon would probably call cosmetic heresy because it accelerates the aging  process. i think of carl sandburg and the white sox; i think of wind in tiananmen square, how a country deprived of laughter ages invisibly; i think  of the great walls of north america, each of them a grip on some outfield like a rookie’s hands around a bat when the wind is against him; i bite  my lower lip again; i want to learn to think in american, to believe that a headline is a fact and all stories are suspect.

 i am an atheist who says his prayers.  i am an anarchist, and a full professor at that. i take the loyalty oath.  i am a deviate. i fondle and contribute, backscuttle and brown, father of three.  i stand high in the community. my name is in who’s who . people argue about my modesty.  i drink my share and yours and never have enough. i free-load officially and unofficially.  a physical coward, i take on all intellectuals, established poets, popes, rabbis, chiefs of staff.  i am a mystic. i will take an oath that i have seen the virgin. under the dry pandanus, to the scratching of kangaroo rats, i achieve psychic onanism. my tree of nerves electrocutes itself.  i uphold the image of america and force my luck. i write my own ticket to oblivion.  i am of the race wrecked by success. the audience brings me news of my death. i write out of boredom, despise solemnity. the wrong reason is good enough for me.  i am of the race of the prematurely desperate. in poverty of comfort i lay gunpowder plots. i lapse my insurance.  i am the babbitt metal of the future. i never read more than half of a book. but that half i read forever.  i love the palimpsest, statues without heads, fertility dolls of the continent of mu. i dream prehistory, the invention of dye. the palms of the dancers’ hands are vermillion. their heads oscillate like the cobra. high-caste woman smelling of earth and silk, you can dry my feet with your hair.  i take my place beside the philistine and unfold my napkin. this afternoon i defend the marines. i goggle at long cars.  without compassion i attack the insane. give them the horsewhip!  the homosexual lectures me brilliantly in the beer booth. i can feel my muscles soften. he smiles at my terror.  pitchpots flicker in the lemon groves. i gaze down on the plains of hollywood. my fine tan and my arrogance, my gray hair and my sneakers, o israel!  wherever i am i become. the power of entry is with me. in the doctor’s office a patient, calm and humiliated. in the foreign movies a native, shabby enough. in the art gallery a person of authority (there’s a secret way of approaching a picture. others move off). the high official insults me to my face. i say nothing and accept the job. he offers me whiskey.  how beautifully i fake! i convince myself with men’s room jokes and epigrams. i paint myself into a corner and escape on pulleys of the unknown. whatever i think at the moment is true. turn me around in my tracks; i will take your side.  for the rest, i improvise and am not spiteful and water the plants on the cocktail table.

 there’s nothing in my face. there is nothing in yours. what we have are called heads. they are nothing unless we kiss. lips are wonderful. they are full of mechanoreceptors. in the old world we all used to kiss and kiss. it was then that we did have faces. we had noses and cheeks and foreheads and soft, downy hair. in the new world we stopped kissing. those who were already here stopped. those who came stopped. now there are only four people who have heads that are also faces. they are an artist and three children for whom i have a face other than my hands.

 i sit and sew—a useless task it seems, my hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams— the panoply of war, the martial tred of men, grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen death, nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath— but—i must sit and sew.  i sit and sew—my heart aches with desire— that pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire on wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things once men. my soul in pity flings appealing cries, yearning only to go there in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe— but—i must sit and sew.  the little useless seam, the idle patch; why dream i here beneath my homely thatch, when there they lie in sodden mud and rain, pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain? you need me, christ! it is no roseate dream that beckons me—this pretty futile seam, it stifles me—god, must i sit and sew?

 i walk back—nowhere, under moonlight. the dogs look as if they are angels, the ones i never imagined, with drooling silvery rays and torn behinds, yes, glowing in a strange and excited phosphor,  dancing out of rhythm, racing up trees, chasing snails. this is like a children's book.  o, yes, the children with rectangle heads and sack stomachs. with the eyes of da vinci, sad and impish, meticulous as ibn khaldun and taciturn as nietzsche, phlegmatic and bitter, when they speak they leave opalescent liquids on the grasses, stuttered  under a half-erased mural of arafat, or is it sharon, wait,  the children never speak, they nod their heads, they carry huge bundles strapped across their foreheads. they weep under newspapers and roll up their skirts and wash them in the gutters, ponds, if they find them, then they run to the sea. this is where we meet, on occasion, we  make up stories, we remember fruits and produce as if blessed by the plutonium blasts.  "remember the pears, they were so green, and the avocados, like guitars, honey-golden, and the asparagus, like a lion's rainy mane, and . . ."  our mouths water. their mouths water, i am used to these stories. i am used to the land barren, bitten and aflame with lies. i am used to our faces in this new wild dispassionate light. i learned this from my musician friends, from years waging futile wars with poetry until i could not think of anything else.

"who lasts a century can have no flaw, i hold that wit a classic, good in law."  suppose he wants a year, will you compound? and shall we deem him ancient, right and sound, or damn to all eternity at once, at ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?  "we shall not quarrel for a year or two; by courtesy of england, he may do."  then by the rule that made the horsetail bare, i pluck out year by year, as hair by hair, and melt down ancients like a heap of snow: while you, to measure merits, look in stowe, and estimating authors by the year, bestow a garland only on a bier.  shakespeare (whom you and ev'ry playhouse bill style the divine, the matchless, what you will) for gain, not glory, wing'd his roving flight, and grew immortal in his own despite. ben, old and poor, as little seem'd to heed the life to come, in ev'ry poet's creed. who now reads cowley? if he pleases yet, his moral pleases, not his pointed wit; forgot his epic, nay pindaric art, but still i love the language of his heart.  "yet surely, surely, these were famous men! what boy but hears the sayings of old ben? in all debates where critics bear a part, not one but nods, and talks of jonson's art, of shakespeare's nature, and of cowley's wit; how beaumont's judgment check'd what fletcher writ; how shadwell hasty, wycherley was slow; but, for the passions, southerne sure and rowe. these, only these, support the crowded stage, from eldest heywood down to cibber's age."  all this may be; the people's voice is odd, it is, and it is not, the voice of god. to gammer gurton if it give the bays, and yet deny the careless husband praise, or say our fathers never broke a rule; why then, i say, the public is a fool. but let them own, that greater faults than we they had, and greater virtues, i'll agree. spenser himself affects the obsolete, and sidney's verse halts ill on roman feet: milton's strong pinion now not heav'n can bound, now serpent-like, in prose he sweeps the ground, in quibbles, angel and archangel join, and god the father turns a school divine. not that i'd lop the beauties from his book, like slashing bentley with his desp'rate hook, or damn all shakespeare, like th' affected fool at court, who hates whate'er he read at school.  but for the wits of either charles's days, the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease; sprat, carew, sedley, and a hundred more, (like twinkling stars the miscellanies o'er) one simile, that solitary shines in the dry desert of a thousand lines, or lengthen'd thought that gleams through many a page, has sanctified whole poems for an age.  i lose my patience, and i own it too, when works are censur'd, not as bad, but new; while if our elders break all reason's laws, these fools demand not pardon, but applause.  on avon's bank, where flow'rs eternal blow, if i but ask if any weed can grow? one tragic sentence if i dare deride, which betterton's grave action dignified, or well-mouth'd booth with emphasis proclaims (though but, perhaps, a muster-roll of names) how will our fathers rise up in a rage, and swear, all shame is lost in george's age! you'd think no fools disgrac'd the former reign, did not some grave examples yet remain, who scorn a lad should teach his father skill, and, having once been wrong, will be so still. he, who to seem more deep than you or i, extols old bards, or merlin's prophecy, mistake him not; he envies, not admires, and to debase the sons, exalts the sires. had ancient times conspir'd to disallow what then was new, what had been ancient now? or what remain'd, so worthy to be read by learned critics, of the mighty dead?  in days of ease, when now the weary sword was sheath'd, and luxury with charles restor'd; in ev'ry taste of foreign courts improv'd, "all, by the king's example, liv'd and lov'd." then peers grew proud in horsemanship t'excel, newmarket's glory rose, as britain's fell; the soldier breath'd the gallantries of france, and ev'ry flow'ry courtier writ romance. then marble, soften'd into life, grew warm, and yielding metal flow'd to human form: lely on animated canvas stole the sleepy eye, that spoke the melting soul. no wonder then, when all was love and sport, the willing muses were debauch'd at court: on each enervate string they taught the note to pant or tremble through an eunuch's throat. but britain, changeful as a child at play, now calls in princes, and now turns away: now whig, now tory, what we lov'd we hate; now all for pleasure, now for church and state; now for prerogative, and now for laws; effects unhappy! from a noble cause.  time was, a sober englishman would knock his servants up, and rise by five o'clock, instruct his family in ev'ry rule, and send his wife to church, his son to school. to worship like his fathers was his care; to teach their frugal virtues to his heir; to prove that luxury could never hold, and place, on good security, his gold. now times are chang'd, and one poetic itch has seiz'd the court and city, poor and rich: sons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays, our wives read milton, and our daughters plays, to theatres, and to rehearsals throng, and all our grace at table is a song. i, who so oft renounce the muses, lie, not {-}{-}{-}{-}{-}'s self e'er tells more fibs than i; when sick of muse, our follies we deplore, and promise our best friends to rhyme no more; we wake next morning in a raging fit, and call for pen and ink to show our wit.  he serv'd a 'prenticeship who sets up shop; ward tried on puppies and the poor, his drop; ev'n radcliffe's doctors travel first to france, nor dare to practise till they've learn'd to dance. who builds a bridge that never drove a pile? (should ripley venture, all the world would smile) but those who cannot write, and those who can, all rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble, to a man.  yet, sir, reflect, the mischief is not great; these madmen never hurt the church or state: sometimes the folly benefits mankind; and rarely av'rice taints the tuneful mind. allow him but his plaything of a pen, he ne'er rebels, or plots, like other men: flight of cashiers, or mobs, he'll never mind; and knows no losses while the muse is kind. to cheat a friend, or ward, he leaves to peter; the good man heaps up nothing but mere metre, enjoys his garden and his book in quiet; and then—a perfect hermit in his diet. of little use the man you may suppose, who says in verse what others say in prose: yet let me show, a poet's of some weight, and (though no soldier) useful to the state. what will a child learn sooner than a song? what better teach a foreigner the tongue? what's long or short, each accent where to place, and speak in public with some sort of grace. i scarce can think him such a worthless thing, unless he praise some monster of a king; or virtue or religion turn to sport, to please a lewd, or unbelieving court. unhappy dryden!—in all charles's days, roscommon only boasts unspotted bays; and in our own (excuse some courtly stains) no whiter page than addison remains. he, from the taste obscene reclaims our youth, and sets the passions on the side of truth, forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art, and pours each human virtue in the heart. let ireland tell, how wit upheld her cause, her trade supported, and supplied her laws; and leave on swift this grateful verse engrav'd, "the rights a court attack'd, a poet sav'd." behold the hand that wrought a nation's cure, stretch'd to relieve the idiot and the poor, proud vice to brand, or injur'd worth adorn, and stretch the ray to ages yet unborn. not but there are, who merit other palms; hopkins and sternhold glad the heart with psalms: the boys and girls whom charity maintains, implore your help in these pathetic strains: how could devotion touch the country pews, unless the gods bestow'd a proper muse? verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work, verse prays for peace, or sings down pope and turk. the silenc'd preacher yields to potent strain, and feels that grace his pray'r besought in vain; the blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng, and heav'n is won by violence of song.  our rural ancestors, with little blest, patient of labour when the end was rest, indulg'd the day that hous'd their annual grain, with feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain: the joy their wives, their sons, and servants share, ease of their toil, and part'ners of their care: the laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl, smooth'd ev'ry brow, and open'd ev'ry soul: with growing years the pleasing licence grew, and taunts alternate innocently flew. but times corrupt, and nature, ill-inclin'd, produc'd the point that left a sting behind; till friend with friend, and families at strife, triumphant malice rag'd through private life. who felt the wrong, or fear'd it, took th' alarm, appeal'd to law, and justice lent her arm. at length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound, the poets learn'd to please, and not to wound: most warp'd to flatt'ry's side; but some, more nice, preserv'd the freedom, and forbore the vice. hence satire rose, that just the medium hit, and heals with morals what it hurts with wit.  we conquer'd france, but felt our captive's charms; her arts victorious triumph'd o'er our arms; britain to soft refinements less a foe, wit grew polite, and numbers learn'd to flow. waller was smooth; but dryden taught to join the varying verse, the full-resounding line, the long majestic march, and energy divine. though still some traces of our rustic vein and splayfoot verse remain'd, and will remain. late, very late, correctness grew our care, when the tir'd nation breath'd from civil war. exact racine, and corneille's noble fire show'd us that france had something to admire. not but the tragic spirit was our own, and full in shakespeare, fair in otway shone: but otway fail'd to polish or refine, and fluent shakespeare scarce effac'd a line. ev'n copious dryden wanted, or forgot, the last and greatest art, the art to blot.  some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire the humbler muse of comedy require. but in known images of life, i guess the labour greater, as th' indulgence less. observe how seldom ev'n the best succeed: tell me if congreve's fools are fools indeed? what pert, low dialogue has farqu'ar writ! how van wants grace, who never wanted wit! the stage how loosely does astr{ae}ea tread, who fairly puts all characters to bed! and idle cibber, how he breaks the laws, to make poor pinky eat with vast applause! but fill their purse, our poet's work is done, alike to them, by pathos or by pun.  o you! whom vanity's light bark conveys on fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise, with what a shifting gale your course you ply, for ever sunk too low, or borne too high! who pants for glory finds but short repose, a breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows. farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play, the silly bard grows fat, or falls away.  there still remains, to mortify a wit, the many-headed monster of the pit: a senseless, worthless, and unhonour'd crowd; who, to disturb their betters mighty proud, clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke, call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke. what dear delight to britons farce affords! farce once the taste of mobs, but now of lords; (for taste, eternal wanderer, now flies from heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes.) the play stands still; damn action and discourse, back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse; pageants on pageants, in long order drawn, peers, heralds, bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn; the champion too! and, to complete the jest, old edward's armour beams on cibber's breast. with laughter sure democritus had died, had he beheld an audience gape so wide. let bear or elephant be e'er so white, the people, sure, the people are the sight! ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar, that bear or elephant shall heed thee more; while all its throats the gallery extends, and all the thunder of the pit ascends! loud as the wolves on orcas' stormy steep, howl to the roarings of the northern deep. such is the shout, the long-applauding note, at quin's high plume, or oldfield's petticoat, or when from court a birthday suit bestow'd sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load. booth enters—hark! the universal peal! "but has he spoken?" not a syllable. "what shook the stage, and made the people stare?" cato's long wig, flow'r'd gown, and lacquer'd chair.  yet lest you think i rally more than teach, or praise malignly arts i cannot reach, let me for once presume t'instruct the times, to know the poet from the man of rhymes: 'tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains, can make me feel each passion that he feigns; enrage, compose, with more than magic art, with pity and with terror tear my heart; and snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air, to thebes, to athens, when he will, and where.  but not this part of the poetic state alone, deserves the favour of the great: think of those authors, sir, who would rely more on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye. or who shall wander where the muses sing? who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring? how shall we fill a library with wit, when merlin's cave is half unfurnish'd yet?  my liege! why writers little claim your thought, i guess: and, with their leave, will tell the fault: we poets are (upon a poet's word) of all mankind, the creatures most absurd: the season, when to come, and when to go, to sing, or cease to sing, we never know; and if we will recite nine hours in ten, you lose your patience, just like other men. then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend a single verse, we quarrel with a friend; repeat unask'd; lament, the wit's too fine for vulgar eyes, and point out ev'ry line. but most, when straining with too weak a wing, we needs will write epistles to the king; and from the moment we oblige the town, expect a place, or pension from the crown; or dubb'd historians by express command, t'enroll your triumphs o'er the seas and land, be call'd to court to plan some work divine, as once for louis, boileau and racine.  yet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown) ah think, what poet best may make them known? or choose at least some minister of grace, fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place.  charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, assign'd his figure to bernini's care; and great nassau to kneller's hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed; so well in paint and stone they judg'd of merit: but kings in wit may want discerning spirit. the hero william, and the martyr charles, one knighted blackmore, and one pension'd quarles; which made old ben, and surly dennis swear, "no lord's anointed, but a russian bear."  not with such majesty, such bold relief, the forms august, of king, or conqu'ring chief, e'er swell'd on marble; as in verse have shin'd (in polish'd verse) the manners and the mind. oh! could i mount on the m{ae}onian wing, your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! what seas you travers'd! and what fields you fought! your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! how barb'rous rage subsided at your word, and nations wonder'd while they dropp'd the sword! how, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, peace stole her wing, and wrapp'd the world in sleep; till earth's extremes your mediation own, and asia's tyrants tremble at your throne— but verse, alas! your majesty disdains; and i'm not us'd to panegyric strains: the zeal of fools offends at any time, but most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme, besides, a fate attends on all i write, that when i aim at praise, they say i bite. a vile encomium doubly ridicules: there's nothing blackens like the ink of fools; if true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, "praise undeserv'd is scandal in disguise." well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; and when i flatter, let my dirty leaves (like journals, odes, and such forgotten things as eusden, philips, settle, writ of kings) clothe spice, line trunks, or flutt'ring in a row, befringe the rails of bedlam and soho.

 we are born with dreams in our hearts, looking for better days ahead. at the gates we are given new papers, our old clothes are taken and we are given overalls like mechanics wear. we are given shots and doctors ask questions. then we gather in another room where counselors orient us to the new land we will now live in. we take tests. some of us were craftsmen in the old world, good with our hands and proud of our work. others were good with their heads. they used common sense like scholars use glasses and books to reach the world. but most of us didn’t finish high school.  the old men who have lived here stare at us, from deep disturbed eyes, sulking, retreated. we pass them as they stand around idle, leaning on shovels and rakes or against walls. our expectations are high: in the old world, they talked about rehabilitation, about being able to finish school, and learning an extra good trade. but right away we are sent to work as dishwashers, to work in fields for three cents an hour. the administration says this is temporary so we go about our business, blacks with blacks, poor whites with poor whites, chicanos and indians by themselves. the administration says this is right, no mixing of cultures, let them stay apart, like in the old neighborhoods we came from.  we came here to get away from false promises, from dictators in our neighborhoods, who wore blue suits and broke our doors down when they wanted, arrested us when they felt like, swinging clubs and shooting guns as they pleased. but it’s no different here. it’s all concentrated. the doctors don’t care, our bodies decay, our minds deteriorate, we learn nothing of value. our lives don’t get better, we go down quick.  my cell is crisscrossed with laundry lines, my t-shirts, boxer shorts, socks and pants are drying. just like it used to be in my neighborhood: from all the tenements laundry hung window to window. across the way joey is sticking his hands through the bars to hand felipé a cigarette, men are hollering back and forth cell to cell, saying their sinks don’t work, or somebody downstairs hollers angrily about a toilet overflowing, or that the heaters don’t work.  i ask coyote next door to shoot me over a little more soap to finish my laundry. i look down and see new immigrants coming in, mattresses rolled up and on their shoulders, new haircuts and brogan boots, looking around, each with a dream in their heart, thinking they’ll get a chance to change their lives.  but in the end, some will just sit around talking about how good the old world was. some of the younger ones will become gangsters. some will die and others will go on living without a soul, a future, or a reason to live. some will make it out of here with hate in their eyes, but so very few make it out of here as human as they came in, they leave wondering what good they are now as they look at their hands so long away from their tools, as they look at themselves, so long gone from their families, so long gone from life itself, so many things have changed.

 late for the feast. let me guess, she said, everything worked against you.  some pulverize experiences at the pool. when the air slaps, they flip into the water and speak of the excitations of distress. the stratagems of delivering an annulled emotion. and how is one to read a nod? is a nod an exclamation?  does one kiss after a nod?  a woman mutters something about the tea being too weak. the walls threaten to expose us, shadows pinch as we mutter jouissance, jouissance, while the university teacher said the use of the word was a considerable error. a most lamentable error, given half of us are illiterate and unattached. think of words in their system of birth. now do you see, the teacher said. ah, see.  dogs were barking for no reason.  some of us went to the ghats and watched the dead burn. woman in white wailed, her hair a dumb struck line against her rocking spine. we look for other distractions in a place of death.  in the afternoon meanings are extolled.  we are asked to name our loves. i will not, he said, use common language to talk of love. i will not jump into the substance without reinforcement. he took his body to the breeze and swayed till we begged him to stop. the rain subsided but we were still wet.  thousands have died in a nod.

 california night. the devil’s wind, the santa ana, blows in from the east, raging through the canyon like a drunk screaming in a bar. the air tastes like a stubbed-out cigarette. but why complain? the weather’s fine as long as you don’t breathe. just lean back on the sweat-stained furniture, lights turned out, windows shut against the storm, and count your blessings. another sleepless night, when every wrinkle in the bedsheet scratches like a dry razor on a sunburned cheek, when even ten-year whiskey tastes like sand, and quiet women in the kitchen run their fingers on the edges of a knife and eye their husbands’ necks. i wish them luck.  tonight it seems that if i took the coins out of my pocket and tossed them in the air they’d stay a moment glistening like a net slowly falling through dark water. i remember the headlights of the cars parked on the beach, the narrow beams dissolving on the dark surface of the lake, voices arguing about the forms, the crackling radio, the sheeted body lying on the sand, the trawling net still damp beside it. no, she wasn’t beautiful—but at that age when youth itself becomes a kind of beauty— “taking good care of your clients, marlowe?”  relentlessly the wind blows on. next door catching a scent, the dogs begin to howl. lean, furious, raw-eyed from the storm, packs of coyotes come down from the hills where there is nothing left to hunt.

 no matter if half the park is concrete and stanchions supporting a bridge,  near industrial buildings yellow in the sun, their stalks of smoke soaring awake,  next to empty lots and bus stops without seats or signs or schedules,  near houses bright with paint the color of dented cans of spam,  men walking the streets to work look longingly towards their doors.  no matter if all the murals decay and the statue of zapata falls,  more months pile to be swept, and years ironed, folded, and put away in drawers,  and if jail bars bite off chunks of your view, remember a wise gambler's words on craps:  call for the dice back. and between rolls, wipe the dust off the dice, as bills coil a foot  in the wind because life is a wild emotion lying in the grass, soon to be green.  not even bags of chips, cheetahs with wind, avoid being tackled, gouged, and ripped apart.  we all eventually submit, are arched over by a hyena grin and growl in the sun.  soon the spots will show and the world will pull tight with relief as the jungle rallies around us, as we smile now and cry later.

 i felt suddenly convinced that i had feelings for the wallpaper. i was especially captivated by its blonde hair and bad dreams. i had the impression the wallpaper needed longer to properly  respond. by the time i left, my affections had produced this abrasion on my cheek. people looked on the abrasion as unquestionable proof of my sincerity. the abrasion was produced by rubbing my face on the paper’s smooth surface. it only occurred to me later that it might have found this sensation disagreeable. but by then i had become known for my abrasion, and i seldom thought of, discussed, or in any way depended upon the wallpaper for anything. my affections, though, had produced upon the paper their own mark. to my irritation and gradual dismay, interest in the paper’s abrasion began to outweigh interest in my own; indeed, mine was starting to fade while the mark upon the paper had deepened with the passing of time. people liked to visit the paper in its room and probe their fingers into the widening tear, by now a gruesome black-edged wound. the silence of the paper during these incursions suggested to some condemnation of their curiosity, but to others implied approval. some even speculated that the paper “enjoyed” the infringement of its surfaces, while most agreed it was a question of the paper enduring this indignity, having little or no opportunity to protest. some visitors could not contain their enthusiasm, and over time other recesses were opened in the paper without its consent. the earliest admirers of the paper’s abrasion were heard lamenting the gulf between the paper’s current state and its previous appearance. they opined that to experience the abrasion now was to encounter a kind of mockery of the gentle and informal gesture it had once been. others contended that while the paper’s condition was certainly different, it couldn’t be in any way “better” or “worse” than it had been  originally; on the contrary, the paper, exhibiting as it did the marks of the affections spent upon it, was in every way a true record of the destruction this attention had wrought, and had become if anything a more moving testament, charting as it did the changing and accelerated passions of the times. in later phases of the paper’s deterioration some expressed admiration for the stoical indifference with which the paper withstood its abusers and wondered if such an attitude might not improve the willing and reciprocal style with which they and their contemporaries were accustomed to receiving each other’s gazes and caresses. against the odds, this view seemed timely and took root in the populace, and to this day in all the estimations of historians and critics of culture it is widely held accountable for the period of dormancy and inertia among the youngest of our people, whose silence and repose has replaced the humors and rages of those whose desires had flown unchecked, who had coupled for so long with such energy and frequency.

 "the younger brother roasted a breast of pishiboro's elephant wife and handed pishiboro some, which he presently ate. then the younger brother said in a voice full of scorn.

 now begins the festival and rivalry of late fall, the weird debauch and daring debacle of frat-boy parties as students parade foggy streets in mock processions, bearing on shoulders scrawny effigies of dead, defeated indians cut from trees, where, in the twilight, they had earlier been hung.  "just dummies," laughs our dad, "red indians hung or burned—it's only in jest." every fall brings the big game against stanford, where young scholars let off steam before the debacle they may face of failed exams. "you're dead wrong," he says to mom. "they don't mock  real, live indians." around uc campus, mock lynchings go on. beneath porches we see hung the scarecrow natives with fake long braids, dead from the merrymaking. on bancroft way, one has fallen indecorously to a lawn, a symbol of the debacle that happened three generations ago in california's hills, where  native peoples were strung up. (a way of having fun? where did they go, those indian ghosts?) "their kids perform mock war dances, whooping, re-enacting scenes of a debacle white folks let loose," chides mom. "meanwhile we hang portraits of presidents on school walls and never let fall the old red, white, and blue. my dear brother is dead  because he fought in a white man's war. how many dead indians do they need to feel okay? this whole thing wears on my soul." in the dark car we go silent, and the fall night gets chillier. in yards, blazing bonfires mock the stars that glow palely somewhere above. a thin moon hangs over the tule fogs. i've never heard the word "debacle”  before and wonder what it means. "what's a debacle, mom? " i ask. "oh, honey, it's a terrible and deadly collapse. complete ruin." i've noticed how the hung indians have their heads slumped forward. they wear old clothes, headbands with feathers, face paint, moc- casins instead of boots. little do we know, this fall,  living indians at feather falls leave tobacco to mark that, indeed, we're still here, lungs full of indigenous air.

 benegal, 1779-1859 the fields flame with it, endless, blue as cobra poison. it has entered our blood and pulses up our veins like night. there is no other color. the planter’s whip splits open the flesh of our faces, a blue liquid light trickles through the fingers. blue dyes the lungs when we breathe. only the obstinate eyes  refuse to forget where once the rice  parted the earth’s moist skin and pushed up reed by reed, green, then rippled gold like the arhiyal’s waves. stitched into our eyelids, the broken dark, the torches of the planter’s men, fire walling like a tidal wave over our huts, ripe charred grain that smelled like flesh. and the wind screaming in the voices of women dragged to the plantation, feet, hair, torn breasts.  in the worksheds, we dip our hands,  their violent forever blue, in the dye, pack it in great embossed chests for the east india company. our ankles gleam thin blue from the chains. after that night many of the women killed themselves. drowning was the easiest. sometimes the arhiyal gave us back the naked, swollen bodies, the faces eaten by fish. we hold on  to red, the color of their saris,  the marriage mark on their foreheads, we hold it carefully inside our blue skulls, like a man in the cold paush night holds in his cupped palms a spark, its welcome scorch, feeds it his foggy breath till he can set it down in the right place, to blaze up and burst like the hot heart of a star over the whole horizon, a burning so beautiful you want it to never end.    note  paush: name of a winter month in the bengali calendar  the planting of indigo was forced on the farmers of bengal, india, by the british, who exported it as a cash crop for almost a hundred years until the peasant uprising of i860, when the plantations were destroyed.

 the bear stopped dancing &amp; unscrewed his head. he held it upside-down in the dusk. she reached into her pouch for a copper piece, but instead pulled out the silvery piece she’d been saving  for some special occasion. a limited issue, stamped on one side with a profile of the prince; on the other side a water wheel did not spin. it glowed in her hand. her hand grew heavy with it,  &amp; the salts, &amp; the bittersome oils of her hand. was this the occasion? the others were there with their fists in their pouches &amp; the weary bear held out his head as if it were an offering  or an object lesson. it was neither. it was ripped, with russet handfuls of animals’ hair pasted on &amp; a secret eye slit recessed in its open maw. the wild old man in the bear suit parted his lips  &amp; out came a snatch of extinct birdsong. the musicians clapped. he’d learned it as a boy growing up in the mist-proud interior where he would call &amp; call until the violet males  in a frenzy swooped into his breathtaking nets.

 everything’s happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event. you want a placid life, find another planet. this one is occupied with the story’s arc: about to happen, on the verge, horizontal. you want another planet, try the moon. try any of the eight, try planet x. it’s out there somewhere, black with serenity. how interesting will our times become? how much more interesting can they become?  a crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily, and croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself. a limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak’s scissors like a rag. we drive past, commenting, and looking upward. a sunny morning, too cold to be nesting, unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.  we’ve been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember. the present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop. to know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can’t be seen is almost a relief. for the future flies in one direction—toward us. and the only way to sidestep it—the only way—is headed this way, too.  so, look. that woman’s got a child by the hand. she’s dragging him across the street. he’s crying and she’s shouting, but we see only dumbshow. their breath is smoke. will she give in and comfort him? will he concede at last? we do not know. their words are smoke. in a minute they’ll be somewhere else entirely. everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. as the crow flies.

 noon, march 6, 1997 from morning’s mouth the bones emerge, a prayer is whispered over rounded horns; the prairie is beyond the quivering hump and holy smoke sparkles released in the breath. braided sweetgrass, be about their hooves; although the grip of hunger lies heavy on the land, let endless native grasses grow among the yellow stones and between the stars. even if only one man had begun to sing, actually it was thousands, she who came to wisconsin farmers and transformed their lives, she who brought her blessing in the form of being newborn, she whom they named the miracle, white buffalo calf maiden must return amid the fast firing of bullets, along the most perilous of paths. rock stars, millionaires, they all offered millions of dollars to struggling white farmers but she had begun her transformation and her prophecy by touching them and they came to understand if not the actual words to the prayers at least the reverence, the need to protect, to keep the doors open. like it was a hundred years ago bounties are gathered from death; trains, buses, cars, planes carry the segmented body of the terrible worm across the land and the screams of the hunted split the sun awake. it is time to restore the stolen beads and shards, the bones and knives to every grave. and the graves are graves no longer but wombs; the bounties burn their hands and bones come flowing from museum shelves to dance in the rippling grass, rebuilding lungs, starting hearts. there must be a hundred men and a hundred men’s worth of heartlessness; wished they could find indians to kill but now that is illegal so they make up some excuse to raise their rifles and take aim, not hearing the rumble of buffalo prayer, not feeling tomorrow tremble or the prophecy of miracle, and smile as they see the legs give way, the horns gouge open the prairie ground, earth betrayed again.

 when working on a small scale he is practicing a gesture. so much of life is practicing gestures. so much of living is evaluating those around you for signs of damage.  now it is night, morning’s a blink away. sleep is sometimes thought of as an avalanche of repair gnomes that attends your pit stop. would that we were sleeping now!  viable alternatives will be reviled until the point of no return is passed. the only reasonable course of action is to look for sizeable flotsam, redo the resume, learn a martial art.

 the farmhouses north of driggs, silos for miles along the road saying butler or sioux. the light saying rain coming on, the wind not up yet, animals waiting as the front hits everything on the high fiats, hailstones bouncing like rabbits under the sage. nothing running off. creeks clear. the river itself a shallow, straight shoot to the north, its rocks mossy, slick above the few deep pockets. on another drainage, the o-t-o. loose stands of aspen on the slopes. dude cabins, their porches and split-log loveseats, dull yellow curtains slapping over the open sills. from emigrant north to the great bend, loaves of haystacks, stud farms, charolais, steel flumes between the ditches. access to the river’s acreage closed to its whole length, the county roads dusty, turning onto the high shelves of side valleys. scattered shacks and corrals. an old homestead, the sod roof rotting out its timbers. below the spurs from the higher range, basins in the mountain pastures fill with odd water. the henbane dries. ruts cross in the grass at a schoolhouse. each runnel mixing where it can the spring creeks deepen and go on easily, swelling to the larger tributary with its pools and banks. at any bend the willows bend too, and gravel bars on the other shore flare into the shallows. an encampment. ponies wade to their knees and drink, raising up now and then to look out through the smoke to the near hills, the one plateau heading off beyond the crazies and the little belts, north. it strikes the river at the gates, the water piling through its broad course, level, ridges and the vertical faces of bluffs crowding to each side. this rock is of an excellent grit for whetstones, hard and sharp. there is here more timber than below the falls. a spring immensely clear and of a bluish cast boils up near its center with such force that its surface in that part is strangely higher than the surrounding earth. i heard today a noise resembling the discharge of a piece of ordnance. unless it be the bursting of the rich mines of silver in these mountains, i am at a loss to account for it. as the passages about the falls are narrow and steep, and as the buffalo travel to the river in great herds, the hinder part presses those in front out of their depth to the strong current. their carcasses by the hundreds litter the shore below the cataracts. we have made of the mast of the pirogue two axletrees. walked ahead to my first view of the falls, hearing them from afar. their spray is scarcely formed when bodies of the same beaten water thrust over and down, concealing every shape, their whiteness alone visible. we will leave at this place all heavy baggage, the red pirogue, and whatever provisions we can do without. needing a cellar for the caching of our stores we set hands to digging. more white bear. these fellows leave a formidable impression in the mud or sand. goodrich, who is remarkably fond of fishing, caught many trout of two different species. came to in a handsome timbered bottom across from the entrance of a very considerable river. its character is so precisely that of the one below that the party with few exceptions has pronounced it the missouri. the fork to the south is perfectly transparent, runs rapidly with an even, unriffled surface. its bed is composed of round, smooth stones like those of rivers issuing from a mountainous country. if this latter be the one we are to take we should encounter within 50 miles a series of precipitous falls. there is now no timber on the hills. the black rock has given place to a yellow and brown or black clay, brown and yellowish white sandstone and a hard, dark freestone. it rises from the water abruptly on both sides in varied walls. i could discover above their horizon only the most elevated points. the river retains both its whitish color and a proportion of its sediment, but it is much clearer than below. the banks afforded us good towing. this method of ascending the river is the safest and most expeditious. we pass a great number of dry streambeds. these plains being level and wholly destitute of timber, the wind blows violently with its loads of sand. driftwood comes down as the water rises. the banks are falling in very fast and i wonder that our pirogues are not swallowed by them. wild hyssop grows here. a few cottonwood along the verges. undergrowths of rose and serviceberry, and small-leafed willow on the sandbars. met this evening the famous white bear. i had rather deal with several indians than with this gentleman. much less ice running in the river. we make ready to set out, the party in general good health except for a few venereal complaints. a windy, blustering day. our two pirogues still frozen. i draw a connection of the country from the information of traders. the falls are about 800 miles west. rose early and commenced roofing the two wings of huts. our situation sandy. cottonwood and elm, some small ash. we must now settle for the winter. very cold. hard frosts. the river falling. for several days we pass deserted mandan villages along both banks. the beaver and otter are becoming more abundant. we put ashore at noon, setting fire to the prairies to signal that we wish council with the natives. these arikara much reduced by pox. it is customary for their nation to show its grief by pain, some cutting off two smaller fingers at the second joint. the earth of the plains is in many places opened in long crevices, its soil indifferent and with a kind of timothy branching like flax from its main stalk. delayed here today so as to take equal altitudes, the weights of the waters of the two rivers, their specific gravities. as we near the great platte, the sandbars are more numerous, sawyers worse than they were below. mulberry, oak and walnut. these prairies from the river have very much the appearance of farms. we continue to pole our way upstream. nothwithstanding our precautions, we struck a bar and were near turning over. the sergeants are directed each to keep a journal of all passing occurrences and such other descriptions of the country as shall seem to them worthy of notice. our hunters report deer in every copse. i got out and walked for one mile through a rush bottom, nettles as high as my breast. all the forepart of the day we were arranging our company and taking on those articles we will need. st. charles. the men spent their last night agreeably, dancing with the french ladies, &amp;c. my ride was on a road finely shaded, with now and then a good farm. the corn in tassel, its leaves of a deep rich green bending at the ends by their own weight. wheat and oat stubble. a hilly country. i passed a toll-gate, and, looking back, had my last view of the town’s steeples. from the state house cupola i could count the buildings, the number of which was ninety. a wooden bridge crosses the river just below the town. men were engaged in racing their horses. i sought lodging and was shown to bed in a large barrack where a man and wife conversed with me until i feigned sleep. this is a post town, the mails arriving from both east and west on wednesdays and saturdays. a young woman gave me directions from an upstairs window. i descended the hill into frankfort. there has lately been established a large manufactory for spinning hemp and flax. it is wrought by water and keeps in motion 1200 spindles. the streets of lexington cross at right angles, its stores filled both with imports and with local goods: fine cutlery, tin ware, muslins and nankeens. i was so well put up that a man would be fastidious to a fault to have found the least thing wanting. approaching the city the land changed steadily for the better, no longer broken, as to the eastward, but fine extensive levels and slopes, the road very wide, with grazing parks, meadows, and every spot cultivated. the farms hereabout have generally good and spacious stone barns, a few acres cleared but for those stumps or girdled trees still standing. the neighbors found last year a human jawbone, rough and honeycombed. my wagoner arrived this afternoon and went on, appointing to be in louisville before me. i pass a house with small turrets at its corners, lawns, the whole needing only vineyards for the look of villas in provence and languedoc. noticed along the banks of the holston phlox with white flowers and phlox with pink flowers, two different species, very small phlox with lance-shaped leaves. where i come in from abingdon, the kentucky road divides, the other fork for burke courthouse. with nothing to do i make ink from gall nuts. more opossum taken in the woods. this animal’s greatest peculiarity is the false belly of the female. she can draw the slit so close that one must look narrowly to find it if she be virgin. the air clearing this morning, i was surprised with a full prospect of mountains. this river where we leave off is 240 miles distant in a straight line from currituck inlet. the turkey-cocks begin to gobble, which is the language wherein they make love. we have a dreamer of dreams among us who warned me in the morning to take care that i not fall into the creek. i thanked him and used what caution i could, but my horse made a false leap and laid me down in the water at my full length. the sky at sunset had a swept look. there was risk of our dining with st. anthony when one indian knocked down a fat bear. of the stem of the silk-grass their women make small aprons which they wear for decency. they put these on with so much art that their most negligent postures reveal nothing to our curiosity. the ruffles of some of our fellows were a little discolored by the bloodroot which these ladies use to improve their charms. bear, it would seem, is no diet for saints, for it is apt to make them too rampant. at night, the surveyors took advantage of a clear sky. this trial of our variance shows it still something less then 3 degrees, so it remains much as we had found it at the sea. we have now run the poles beyond those inhabitants most inland. there fell a sort of scots mist all the way. i have learned how rattlesnakes take a squirrel. they ogle the poor beast till by force of charm it falls down stupefied and senseless. the snake approaches it and moistens first one ear and then the other with his spittle, making the head all slippery. when that is done he draws this member into his mouth, and after it, by casual degrees, all the rest of the body. i am not so rigid an observer of the sabbath as to allow of no journeys to be taken upon it. nor would i care, like a certain new england magistrate, to order a man to the whipping post for daring to ride for a midwife on the lord’s day. and yet we found plainly that travelling on the sunday had not thriven with us in the least. the rain was enlivened with loud thunder, and there is something in the woods that makes this sound more awful, the violence of the lightning more visible as the trees are shivered quite to the root. this great dismal swamp is the source of five several rivers. we run our line to its skirts, which begin with dwarf reeds, moist uneven ground. the season inclining us to aguish distempers, we were suffered by the resident to cut up wood for firing, drive away the damps. at the bottom of the account mankind are great losers by the luxuries of feather beds and warm apartments. we perceive our appetites to mend, and though we have to drink only what adam had in paradise, that stream of life runs cool and peaceably in our veins. the days are hard. our slumbers sweeten, and if ever we dream of women they are kind. i delight to see the banks of the inlet adorned with myrtle, yet it must be owned that, sacred to venus though it be, this plant grows commonly in very dirty soil. norfolk has most the air of a town of any in virginia. there are now riding at her wharves near 20 brigantines. the trade hither is engrossed by those saints of new england who every week carry off a pretty deal of tobacco. i have found that after my devotions a walk in the garden can do much to fill my heart with clear obedience. i repair me there that i might think deeply of the earth and how it will be all too soon my sleeping-place. for i am told to fear such things as bring me to ill terms, told of those who seek congress with the earth that they shall have her in their time forever. that her places sing their love-songs for no man. that i am not the suitor whose betrothed awaits him, but some unwelcome third with god alone her lover. and yet i would look upon such country as will show me nature undressed, the strata of the land, her lays and beds and all her privacies. for my wonder tells me i should be promiscuous, should learn by all the laws of bodies and by where they are the joyful news out of the new found world. this walk is news. its bodies point me always in and out along some newer course. there have been divers days together wherein alone i’ve watched these flowers buoyed on their stems and holding up the sun. just now i catch them thinking on themselves, composing from their dark places the least passages for light, tendering how they look and how i look on them. it comes to me that the world is to the end of it thinking on itself and how its parts gather with one another for their time. these are the light, and all the forms they show are lords of inns wherein the soul takes rest. if i could find it in myself to hide the world within the world then there would

 oh, a dainty plant is the ivy green, that creepeth o’er ruins old! of right choice food are his meals, i ween, in his cell so lone and cold. the wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed, to pleasure his dainty whim: and the mouldering dust that years have made is a merry meal for him. creeping where no life is seen, a rare old plant is the ivy green.  fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings, and a staunch old heart has he. how closely he twineth, how tight he clings, to his friend the huge oak tree! and slily he traileth along the ground, and his leaves he gently waves, as he joyously hugs and crawleth round the rich mould of dead men’s graves. creeping where grim death has been, a rare old plant is the ivy green.  whole ages have fled and their works decayed, and nations have scattered been; but the stout old ivy shall never fade, from its hale and hearty green. the brave old plant, in its lonely days, shall fatten upon the past: for the stateliest building man can raise, is the ivy’s food at last. creeping on, where time has been, a rare old plant is the ivy green.

 sometimes after hours of wine i can almost see the night gliding in low off the harbor down the long avenues of shop windows  past mannequins, perfect in their gestures. i leave some water steaming on the gas ring and sometimes i can slip from my body,  almost find the single word to prevent evenings that absolve nothing, a winter lived alone and cold. rooms where you somehow marry  the losses of strangers that tremble on the walls like the hands of the dancer next door, luminous  with methedrine, she taps walls for hours murmuring about the silver she swears lines the building, the hallways  where each night drunks stammer their usual rosary until they come to rest beneath the tarnished numbers, the bulbs  that star each ceiling. i must tell you i am afraid to sit here losing myself to the hour’s slow erasure  until i know myself only by this cold weight, this hand on my lap, palm up. i want to still the dancer’s hands  in mine, to talk about forgiveness and what we leave behind—faces and cities, the small emergencies  of nights. i say nothing, but leaning on the sill, i watch her leave at that moment  when the first taxis start rolling to the lights of chinatown, powered by sad and human desire. i watch her fade  down the street until she’s a smudge, violent in the circle of my breath. a figure so small i could cup her in my hands.

 what if i know, liebknecht, who shot you dead. tiegarten trees unroll staggering shadow, in spite of it all. i am among the leaves; the inevitable voices have nothing left to say, the holed head bleeding across a heap of progressive magazines; torn from your face, trees that turned around, we do not sanctify the land with our wandering. look upon our children, they are mutilated.

 there they go marching all in step so gay!  smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.  blithely they go as to a wedding day,  the mothers' sons.   the drab street stares to see them row on row  on the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.  too careless-gay for courage, singing they go  into the dark.   with tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,  they pipe the way to glory and the grave;  foolish and young, the gay and golden boys  love cannot save.   high heart! high courage! the poor girls they kissed  run with them : they shall kiss no more, alas!  out of the mist they stepped-into the mist  singing they pass.

 these empty words are so remote. they are stories someone wants to believe at the end of the century. everyone gathers their sea of telluric pain to greet the beginning of the new world.  cars stop and watch the deck chairs limp across the street to await the coming of the new year. it is the end of summer and autumn and winters and springs, and panzer infatuation.  after four hundred eighty-one years, i cannot pull out the spanish arrow in my eye. suddenly everything i knew was inhuman: the oceans, the tadpoles in their new cars. the clams became cheerleaders. the palm trees, strippers, and everyone forgot, deer are the shapes of god.  his official language became latin, when he ceased to be a jew, biting his nails and collecting cans like a cheap minister with sunny gold teeth. the tender years that once wore oysters would never speak to him again.  the female spider became a lesbian, devouring our new long legs, that would never again climb the toy steps our fathers left us. although our legs are hairy and the lilies of a theater, the gentle lips of our pyramids rest on our souls like a lover’s fingers.  how many aspirins will we take to reach the surface of truth? my existence is for sale. the dawn is learning english. the waves of the sea are unionizing.  the stones that were once our troubled hearts are eating chocolate. i come to sell you fish, the bread in my blood and my existence.

 october, 1918 across a world where all men grieve and grieving strive the more, the great days range like tides and leave our dead on every shore. heavy the load we undergo, and our own hands prepare, if we have parley with the foe, the load our sons must bear.  before we loose the word that bids new worlds to birth, needs must we loosen first the sword of justice upon earth; or else all else is vain since life on earth began, and the spent world sinks back again hopeless of god and man.  a people and their king through ancient sin grown strong, because they feared no reckoning would set no bound to wrong; but now their hour is past, and we who bore it find evil incarnate held at last to answer to mankind.  for agony and spoil of nations beat to dust, for poisoned air and tortured soil and cold, commanded lust, and every secret woe the shuddering waters saw— willed and fulfilled by high and low— let them relearn the law:  that when the dooms are read, not high nor low shall say:— "my haughty or my humble head has saved me in this day." that, till the end of time, their remnant shall recall their fathers' old, confederate crime availed them not at all:  that neither schools nor priests, nor kings may build again a people with the heart of beasts made wise concerning men. whereby our dead shall sleep in honour, unbetrayed, and we in faith and honour keep that peace for which they paid.

 from our deep cool verandah we spy on the world passing by. we both wear glasses in order to pick out the details. even as children we noticed all. people would say dont like those twins they look at you funny. we were reassured. our powers had been confirmed. but that was a long while ago. now we are 60. we have lived in this ground floor flat on the main road for 20 years. it is a very suitable dwelling, and we have a satisfactory relationship with the landlord. we think he is pleased we notice his transparency. we have been here since we left our husbands who got in the way of our observations.  after our evening meal we talk quietly of what we have seen. we believe in sharing our observations in case one of us has missed something. for our eyesight isnt as sharp as it was ten years ago. though we do clean our glasses each hour and keep our hair tied firmly back in small grey buns so nothing can distract our focus. we are small women. many people do not notice us, while we are noticing them. we keep to ourselves. mother used to say to us never get too friendly with strangers they can harm you. even if they smile and offer you an hour of their lives dont tell them nothing. mother knew a lot. she always kept the bible and a cloth to clean her hands on the kitchen table within reach.  at night we take turns to sit at the window and watch. we set the alarm at 2 and 6. this way we both get some sleep. theres always something to see along this road. even at 3 in the morning. last night we saw a woman in a torn fur coat, gum boots and a beanie blow up balloons, tie them on her arms as if they were wings. she climbed up a tree, spread her arms and jumped. we think she might have injured herself. she screamed for quite a while until one of the passing motorists stopped and rang for an ambulance. we didnt want to get involved. our slippers might have gotten wet. it had been raining quite heavily.  another night one of the local drunks fell asleep on our verandah. he smelt wretched but we were pleased to be able to get a closer look at him. for several weeks we had been trying to work out a few things about him. at least we were able to see how thick and long the scar on his bald head was. we were able to read the words on his tattoos, ‘dearest jean’ and ‘sailor boy’. we also saw a thin line thru the word ‘jean’ as if he had tried to cut the word out. very interesting. we scrubbed the verandah with disinfectant the next morning. it didnt take long.  we keep records of our observations in a private code in large journals. we are saving them up for the day when our memories fail us. then we can read them thru to recall the details. they are an assurance that our days have been full and busy. we put black velvet covers on these books. they are so soft to stroke. just like the backs of our 8 black cats who often sleep like guardians in front of the cupboard as if they recognised the importance of its contents.  there are many folks with bad legs along this road. they hobble ever so slowly up and down all day as if they had all the time in the world. they bandage their legs in different ways. some of the bandages are rather grubby. you’d think theyd wash them. there are plenty of laundromats around here. every pension day they could wash them. they could share a machine. you can fit a good deal in one of these contraptions – at least ten bandages. dear me. if theyd looked where they were going instead of expecting life to do everything for them, they wouldnt be in this predicament. we’re so pleased we’re not handicapped. we have only ourselves to thank. and of course mother.  pension morning is always busy. we always make sure the teapot is full by 9.30. the crowd gathers outside the bank. for at least  half an hour. theres no time to get up and put the jug on for some time. they clutter the footpath. so many of them. it takes a while for us to sort out who’s there. we sometimes use the journal if we cant quite locate every face. often its the only way to really know who died before the postman called. on our deep cool verandah we sit. the twins. there are no mirrors in our hallway.

 it's not exile, homes and families behind us, where we meet. it happens anywhere, now: a stateless state of no name, quietly seceding from the crumbling empires round us,  without stamps or eurovision entries. no-one does it with a rough guide in a week. you inhabit it or nothing. like this: in a pavement cafe you blink and you seem to surprise them,  the crowd, all its separate faces at once, coming out of solution like crystals, like a rush of starlings or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning now and dents your cappuccino froth  with a crisp little sound. and that's it: between breaths, just between you and me as if; yes, qed. you are received. this is the freedom of the city, and the key  to the kingdom, and its borders ripple outwards like a frill of breaking wave onto flat sand, a wavering line already fading leaving spume-flecks high and dry,  a prickling on your palm; you're five years old, looking up at the whole sea, unsure: will you laugh or cry?

 over our heads, trailing a wake of air and an enormous shadow as it passed, the falcon glided to its trainer’s fist and settled like a loaded weapon there.  then, while she fed the bird bit after bit of... what? rabbit? the trainer gave her talk: these birds, she said, prey on the small and weak, adding for the children’s benefit  that this, though it seems cruel, is really good since otherwise the other rabbits, mice, squirrels, what have you, would run out of space and die of illness or a lack of food.  i know what she was trying to get across, and i don’t doubt it would be healthier if we were more familiar than we are with how the natural world draws life from loss;  and granted, nothing is more natural than death incarnate falling from the sky; and granted, it is better some should die, however agonizingly, than all.  still, to teach children this is how things go is one thing, to insist that it is good is something else—it is to make a god of an unsatisfactory status quo,  this vicious circle that the clock hands draw and quarter, while the serpent bites its tail, or eats the dust, or strikes at someone’s heel, or winds up comprehended by a claw.  she launched the bird again. we watched it climb out of the amphitheatre, headed toward the darkened spires of a nearby wood, then bank, then angle toward us one last time.

 in december 1941, after lvov had already been seized by nazis while you labored diligently by day as a quiet feeder of lice in a virus lab and joined your heart to the resistance that would rise in warsaw, my own country’s agents took me from my home in lā‘ie, placed me in a jail cell in honolulu and interrogated me for many days. neither of us had thought of our poetry then, zbigniew, not of the caustic sarcasm of your strophes stripped of pious words, not of the praises of the life i would lose like a lavish field of rice once bending with weight but blighted overnight by the black cowls of disease. i told them i was just a storekeeper who liked night fishing — no submarines was i signaling offshore, nothing but schooling fish did i hope would come to the sputtering lights of my torches that i stuck in the sand like stakes for growing beans in my family garden. the ocean knew of my intentions, lapping softly at my knees, curling in kind, foaming waters around the bones of my bare feet. and the winds knew of my  poverty, sending me a cloudless night sky, stippling the lagoon with stalks of red flames. but my government questioners cited my language was the enemy’s, my academy in hiroshima a military school, my citizen’s heart black as diesel.  they sent me to a barracks on an island in pearl harbor where i could see the burnt wreckage of scores of ships, hear their moaning steel like drowned sailors who still cry out, throats choked with oil, from their watery graves, feel nothing but panic and regret as though a child had died, my hope wrapped in old newspapers and thrown away like offal cleaned from a fish the size of a man.  then to a ship bound for oakland, and by train and truck with men like me, japanese all, to fort missoula, and a cold wind like a dull razor scraping across my stubbled face. what was my crime except to belong to an enemy race? why can they not see that i love, like them, the promise that is this land like a wife to whom we have sworn only faith and practiced devotion? i would wash her feet with water gathered in a canvas bucket, carry her burdens across canefields and over the shallows of our bay, ruffled with wind, if she would, yet once more as on her bridal evening, speak her vows and turn the soft bundles of her body, heaving like a warm tide in my arms, back to mine.

 it was a picture i had after the war. a bombed english church. i was too young to know the word english or war, but i knew the picture. the ruined city still seemed noble. the cathedral with its roof blown off was not less godly. the church was the same plus rain and sky. birds flew in and out of the holes god’s fist made in the walls. all our desire for love or children is treated like rags by the enemy. i knew so much and sang anyway. like a bird who will sing until it is brought down. when they take away the trees, the child picks up a stick and says, this is a tree, this the house and the family. as we might. through a door of what had been a house, into the field of rubble, walks a single lamb, tilting its head, curious, unafraid, hungry.

 when i see the houses in this city, the electric gates and uniformed men employed to guard the riches of the rich, the gilded columns and gardens, the boats on water, i wonder, how to describe my home to you: the short, mud walls, the whispering roof, the veranda on which my whole family used to spread sheets and sleep.  the year i came to find work in the city, my wife painted our house white so it would be brighter than the neighbours'. i beat her for her foolishness. the children are hungry, i said, the cow is old, the money collector is after my blood, and you steal like a magpie— half a month's wage—to decorate your nest like a shiny jewel?  the monsoon finally arrived the year i left, dripped through the thatch, peeled paint off the walls. the wells grew full and overflowed. the farmers rejoiced in the fields. my son sat with his mouth open catching drops of water like a frog. my wife clung to the walls and wept.  when i fall asleep on the pavements in this city, i try to imagine my wife's skin against mine, the kohl in her eyes, the white walls, the whole village sky bearing down upon us with all the weight of the stars. i think of returning to that life, but mostly i try to remember how the world was once. i want to open my mouth like my son, and swallow things whole— feel water filling all the voids, until i am shaped back into existence.

 in the clear light that confuses everything only you, dark laurel, shadow my house,  lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake. and at night, quivering with tears,  you are like the tree called tasso’s. crippled, and hooped with iron, it stands on peter’s hill.  when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity,  that tree makes their own torsion seem natural. and so, they’re comforted.   2 one of the local philosophers ... he says, “in california we have the old anarchist tradition.”  what can he mean? is there an anarchist tradition? and why would an anarchist want one? o california,  is there a tree without opinions? come, let me clasp you! let me feel the idea breathing.  i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts— “the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall.”  like the girls in our neighborhood, they’re beautiful and silent.   3 as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china. a lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other.  i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods. he pointed behind him, and i saw  that the hills were covered with armed men, and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear.  he said, “we are as various as the twigs of a tree, but now the tree moves as one man.  it walks. and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving.”   4 i said, “yet, all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing.  when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear and all the dead we had to,  it was a time of forgetfulness, like a plucked string. it was a river of darkness.  was it not so on your side, when you came to the sea that was covered with ships? let us speak to each other,  let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air. that bird flies over the heads of the armed men.”   5 one part of the tree grows outward. the other i saw when, with a light, i explored the cellar—shattering roots.  they had broken through the wall, as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last.  i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles. these things are the beginning  of things not visible to the naked eye. it was so in the time of tobit— the dish glowed when the angel held it.  it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning.  
NEW POEM
 (for harlem magic) the laws of science teach us a pound of gold weighs as much as a pound of flour though if dropped from any undetermined height in their natural state one would reach bottom and one would fly away  laws of motion tell us an inert object is more difficult to propel than an object heading in the wrong direction is to turn around. motion being energy—inertia—apathy. apathy equals hostility. hostility—violence. violence being energy is its own virtue. laws of motion teach us  black people are no less confused because of our blackness than we are diffused because of our powerlessness. man we are told is the only animal who smiles with his lips. the eyes however are the mirror of the soul  the problem with love is not what we feel but what we wish we felt when we began to feel we should feel something. just as publicity is not production: seduction is not seductive  if i could make a wish i’d wish for all the knowledge of all the world. black may be beautiful professor micheau says but knowledge is power. any desirable object is bought and sold—any neglected object declines in value. it is against man’s nature to be in either category  if white defines black and good defines evil then men define women or women scientifically speaking describe men. if sweet is the opposite of sour and heat the absence of cold then love is the contradiction of pain and beauty is in the eye of the beheld  sometimes i want to touch you and be touched in return. but you think i’m grabbing and i think you’re shirking and mama always said to look out for men like you  so i go to the streets with my lips painted red and my eyes carefully shielded to seduce the world my reluctant lover  and you go to your men slapping fives feeling good posing as a man because you know as long as you sit very very still the laws of motion will be in effect  
NEW POEM
 women’s tears are but water; the tears of men are blood.  he sits alone in the firelight and on either side drifts by sleep, like a torrent whirling, profound, wrinkled and dumb.  circuitously, stealthily, dawn occupies the city; as if the seasons knew of his grief spring has suddenly changed into snow  disaster and sorrow have made him their pet; he cannot escape their accursed embraces. for all his dodgings memory will lacerate him.  what good does it do to wander nights hours through city streets? only that in poor places he can be with common men and receive their unspoken instinctive sympathy.  what has life done for him? he stands alone in the darkness like a sentry never relieved, looking over a barren space, awaiting the tardy finish.

NEW POEM
 very soon the yankee teachers came down and set up school; but, oh! how the rebs did hate it,— it was agin’ their rule.  our masters always tried to hide book learning from our eyes; knowledge did’nt agree with slavery— ’twould make us all too wise.  but some of us would try to steal a little from the book. and put the words together, and learn by hook or crook.  i remember uncle caldwell, who took pot liquor fat and greased the pages of his book, and hid it in his hat.  and had his master ever seen the leaves upon his head, he’d have thought them greasy papers, but nothing to be read.  and there was mr. turner’s ben, who heard the children spell, and picked the words right up by heart, and learned to read ’em well.  well, the northern folks kept sending the yankee teachers down; and they stood right up and helped us, though rebs did sneer and frown.  and i longed to read my bible, for precious words it said; but when i begun to learn it, folks just shook their heads,  and said there is no use trying, oh! chloe, you’re too late; but as i was rising sixty, i had no time to wait.  so i got a pair of glasses, and straight to work i went, and never stopped till i could read the hymns and testament.  then i got a little cabin a place to call my own— and i felt independent as the queen upon her throne.

 for david trinidad i was seventeen in orlando, heading toward  orange blossom trail, where the porn was. fairvilla video,  its fried, freshened air. i was terrified but also thrilled,  on the edge. can anyone even remember how hard-  won a little corner of sex was then, no internet,  no hope, no combination? i can’t; i can.  in an elaborate bid to convince  myself and the clerk i was bisexual, i bought a bisexual  video that i can’t recall, and a box  that made my heart stop: leo &amp; lance. (vhs wasn’t cheap:  i spent all my allowance.) i can measure  this adventure in increments of shame:  tape loop, checkout, the run-walk  to my red buick (no one could miss me), the peel out.  and the drive home, anticipation, cruel cellophane . . .  leo ford, born leo john hilgeford, looked like california  by way of dayton. there was his tender love of divine,  that rumored three-way on fire island with calvin klein.  late in his career he raised rare birds, volunteered  at project angel food. he was versatile: so much to give.  and lance, david alan reis, from santa barbara,  or maybe oklahoma. poor orphan, the stints  in jail, iv drugs, and conversion.  leo and lance had the chance to work together  twice on film— leo &amp; lance and blonds do it best—  and more than once on the corner. where have all  the hustlers gone, anyway? they died  weeks apart, in 1991. lance first,  in may, in san jose, of aids complications.  on the death certificate, his job is listed as “model of clothing.”  that july, leo on his motorcycle was struck by a truck  on sunset. “chillingly, leo had played a motorcycle accident  victim in games,” says imdb, so those who knew  his oeuvre might have seen it coming. after the wake at josie’s,  his ashes were scattered by the golden gate bridge. a tree in india—  imdb again, as if the truth matters— was planted in his name . . .  as i try to get this right, i pull up my cache  of scanned porn. leo &amp; lance: it begins in synth,  cali melancholy canyon light, and here’s leo,  shirtless, running up a hill in tight denim,  letterman jacket thrown over his shoulder— now the tinkling  piano; now’s a good time to jerk off by the last of the snow.  god, bottle-blond leo. but wait, who is that loping up the hill,  gawky, rugged, also blond, a dumbfounded wow uttered as he watches  leo shoot? of course: it’s lance. before they formally meet,  before they go back to the lodge and do what they do  better than life, they have a little snowball fight, brief, unexpectedly sweet—  like children in the street.  
NEW POEM
 white founts falling in the courts of the sun, and the soldan of byzantium is smiling as they run; there is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared, it stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard, it curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips, for the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships. they have dared the white republics up the capes of italy, they have dashed the adriatic round the lion of the sea, and the pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss, and called the kings of christendom for swords about the cross, the cold queen of england is looking in the glass; the shadow of the valois is yawning at the mass; from evening isles fantastical rings faint the spanish gun, and the lord upon the golden horn is laughing in the sun.  dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard, where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred, where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall, the last knight of europe takes weapons from the wall, the last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung, that once went singing southward when all the world was young, in that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid, comes up along a winding road the noise of the crusade. strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far, don john of austria is going to the war, stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold in the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold, torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums, then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes. don john laughing in the brave beard curled, spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world, holding his head up for a flag of all the free. love-light of spain—hurrah! death-light of africa! don john of austria is riding to the sea.  mahound is in his paradise above the evening star, (don john of austria is going to the war.) he moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri’s knees, his turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas. he shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease, and he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees, and his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring black azrael and ariel and ammon on the wing. giants and the genii, multiplex of wing and eye, whose strong obedience broke the sky when solomon was king.  they rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn, from temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn; they rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be; on them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl, splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl; they swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground,— they gather and they wonder and give worship to mahound. and he saith, “break up the mountains where the hermit-folk can hide, and sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide, and chase the giaours flying night and day, not giving rest, for that which was our trouble comes again out of the west. we have set the seal of solomon on all things under sun, of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done, but a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and i know the voice that shook our palaces—four hundred years ago: it is he that saith not ‘kismet’; it is he that knows not fate ; it is richard, it is raymond, it is godfrey in the gate! it is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth, put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth.” for he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar, (don john of austria is going to the war.) sudden and still—hurrah! bolt from iberia! don john of austria is gone by alcalar.  st. michael’s on his mountain in the sea-roads of the north (don john of austria is girt and going forth.) where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift and the sea folk labour and the red sails lift. he shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone; the noise is gone through normandy; the noise is gone alone; the north is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes and dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise, and christian killeth christian in a narrow dusty room, and christian dreadeth christ that hath a newer face of doom, and christian hateth mary that god kissed in galilee, but don john of austria is riding to the sea. don john calling through the blast and the eclipse crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips, trumpet that sayeth ha! domino gloria! don john of austria is shouting to the ships.  king philip’s in his closet with the fleece about his neck (don john of austria is armed upon the deck.) the walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin, and little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in. he holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon, he touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon, and his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day, and death is in the phial, and the end of noble work, but don john of austria has fired upon the turk. don john’s hunting, and his hounds have bayed— booms away past italy the rumour of his raid gun upon gun, ha! ha! gun upon gun, hurrah! don john of austria has loosed the cannonade.  the pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke, (don john of austria is hidden in the smoke.) the hidden room in man’s house where god sits all the year, the secret window whence the world looks small and very dear. he sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea the crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery; they fling great shadows foe-wards, making cross and castle dark, they veil the plumèd lions on the galleys of st. mark; and above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs, and below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs, christian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines. they are lost like slaves that sweat, and in the skies of morning hung the stair-ways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young. they are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on before the high kings’ horses in the granite of babylon. and many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell, and he finds his god forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign— (but don john of austria has burst the battle-line!) don john pounding from the slaughter-painted poop, purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate’s sloop, scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds, breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds, thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea white for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty. vivat hispania!

 let america be america again. let it be the dream it used to be. let it be the pioneer on the plain seeking a home where he himself is free.

(it never was america to me.)  o, let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no false patriotic wreath, but opportunity is real, and life is free, equality is in the air we breathe.

 after neruda  go ahead, ask: where are the pomegranates, the dates, the girls with skin brown as hash, the hash?  listen to what’s happening  one morning bonfires began to leap from the earth, devouring human beings, lit by matches flicked across the sky with joysticks. and from then on fire, from then on burning hair, from then on limbs and meat. invisible bandits, pickpockets from ten-thousand feet, faceless, thoughtless, dumb except for humming, bandits marked with tiny flags, controlled from continents away by children, child bandits with letter jackets left hanging in their girlfriends' closets, child bandits with bibles thumbed and highlighted, spear missiles through the sky to kill other children and the blood of children runs through the streets, neither seen nor heard, obedient, simply, like children's blood.  ask away: why doesn’t his poetry describe our urban loneliness, the body drenched in metaphor?  there’s nothing to see here, nothing to see, just blood in the sand, blood in the streets, nothing to see.

 i see you, not as you stand before me, so full of language threatening to spill from you, a silver-blue luminous substance the page of cups might carry in love, in a gold chalice, but as a child i might have seen, held, had i been an adult on that island where we might have become anyone other than ourselves.  you are a sound you say your father carries, a beat in the heart of an african drum that seduced him with the thunder of changó the red of blood and earth, a flesh-pink guava growing inside you, its seeds on the tips of your fingers like islands, like memories becoming leaves, their veined undersides becoming maps, palmlines, bridges where the sound of water collects childhood in a blue bucket of memory, where my tío machuco stands with childhood sandwiches i ate sitting on the cold terraza, leaning against the southwest red of that couch tía hilda discarded like a useless memory when we were no longer voices in open rooms with connecting doors, when we were words, onion-skinned paper as transparent as re-written history or exile.

 in order to upgrade the community ’ s appreciation of poetry during the international year of cultural enrichment stage 2, members of the state’s library progress committee decided to establish a small library of t-shirts on which would be printed quality verse in vivid, bold colours and lettering. the poems would be selected on the basis of one of three qualities: is the poem poignant, perspicacious, or pithy.  given the respectably researched fact that the wearing of words on t-shirts expresses a deep psychic desire for an intimate union of word and flesh, (and bear in mind the way “ logo ” nudges towards “ logos ” ) it is not surprising that this library of t-shirts has been a great success. no one seems to mind borrowing pre-worn clothing. of course the library ’ s washing and ironing staff maintain the t-shirts in excellent condition. even after ten borrowings the shirts look brand new. and considering the phenomenal success of andrew lloyd webber’s “cats” it is no shock revelation that t.s. eliot ’ s “ hollow men ” has proved to be the library ’ s most popular t-shirt so far. in fact there are now eight copies of this shirt on loan, most in metallic or fluoro colours.  a couple of the more entrepreneurial of the library’s progress committee members are leading the push for diversification of the library’s poetry program, into neck to knee anti-uv swimwear, with maybe slessor, shelly and stevie smith prints for starters; and into underpants, with their multiple attractions.  while the committee feels both these garments could increase poetry’s appeal, they are worried about the practicability of adding these garments to the t-shirt poetry collection. would many members want to borrow preworn underpants, however compelling the poems’ cadences and metaphors; while the wear and tear on the swimming costume fabric via chlorine and salt water would perhaps be too great. however they are interested in marketing and selling these articles from a stall in the library’s foyer. the only committee member unenthusiastic regarding this proposal is an optometrist who has raised the issue of eye damage if the typeface of the lines of verse on the underpants were too small. a solution in the form of large print haikus is being considered.

 i’ve been excited about him as an individual. i’ve met him as a person, emerging from his own shadow. indeed it is remarkable. indeed it is to be remarked of my friend savage that the desolation of hopes not merely deferred but by impracticability brutalized little marred his genial spirit. how such a one, so circumstanced by parentage— the mother crippled by disappointment; the father by rotgut and percodan— as to blight his prospects, and blacken with untimely frost the buds of those ambitions justly excited by manifest powers, graces, and propensities, should nonetheless display discrimination not inferior to those we deem wise, sympathy judicious and above reproach, is cause for a wonder neither cynicism can besmirch nor incredulity subvert. in and out of juvie, jacking cars at fifteen, snorting lines of adderall, his nostrils stained blue, kicked out, taken back, kicked out, busted, paroled, busted again, straining to reach the shiny object fallen through the grate, tantalizing, just beyond his fingers, finding and losing god, thinking as he rakes the leaves of the linden tree outside the sublet bungalow that eating, sleeping, dying are what it’s all about, nothing else, maybe a few sunsets, forget about sex.

 a group of young men in jacksonville, florida, arranged to celebrate lincoln’s birthday in 1900. my brother, j. rosamond johnson, and i decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises. i wrote the words and he wrote the music. our new york publisher, edward b. marks, made mimeographed copies for us, and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children. shortly afterwards my brother and i moved away from jacksonville to new york, and the song passed out of our minds. but the school children of jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. within twenty years it was being sung over the south and in some other parts of the country. today the song, popularly known as the negro national hymn, is quite generally used. the lines of this song repay me in an elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever i hear them sung by negro children. lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring, ring with the harmonies of liberty; let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies, let it resound loud as the rolling sea. sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us. facing the rising sun of our new day begun, let us march on till victory is won.  stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod, felt in the days when hope unborn had died; yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed? we have come over a way that with tears has been watered, we have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.  god of our weary years, god of our silent tears, thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; thou who hast by thy might led us into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray. lest our feet stray from the places, our god, where we met thee, lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee; shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand. true to our god, true to our native land.

 dedicated to the federal and late confederate soldiers like heart-loving brothers we meet, and still the loud thunders of strife, the blaze of fraternity kindles most sweet, there’s nothing more pleasing in life.  the black cloud of faction retreats, the poor is no longer depressed, see those once discarded resuming their seats, the lost strangers soon will find rest.  the soldier no longer shall roam, but soon shall land safely ashore, each soon will arrive at his own native home, and struggle in warfare no more.  the union of brothers is sweet, whose wives and children do come, their sons and fair daughters with pleasure they greet, when long absent fathers come home.  they never shall languish again, nor discord their union shall break, when brothers no longer lament and complain, hence never each other forsake.  hang closely together like friends, by peace killing foes never driven, the storm of commotion eternally ends, and earth will soon turn into heaven.

 she stands beside me, stands away, the vague indifference of her dreams. dreaming, to go on, and go on there, like animals fleeing the rise of the earth. but standing intangible, my lust a worked anger a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul.  then back off, and where you go? box of words and pictures. steel balloons tied to our mouths. the room fills up, and the house. street tilts. city slides, and buildings slide into the river. what is there left, to destroy? that is not close, or closer. leaning away in the angle of language. pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross and flash. it is the lovers pulling down empty structures. they wait and touch and watch their dreams eat the morning.

 he is gone, the strong base of the nation, the dove to his covet has fled; ye heroes lament his privation, for lincoln is dead.  he is gone down, the sun of the union, like phoebus, that sets in the west; the planet of peace and communion, forever has gone to his rest.  he is gone down from a world of commotion, no equal succeeds in his stead; his wonders extend with the ocean, whose waves murmur, lincoln is dead.  he is gone and can ne’er be forgotten, whose great deeds eternal shall bloom; when gold, pearls and diamonds are rotten, his deeds will break forth from the tomb.  he is gone out of glory to glory, a smile with the tear may be shed, o, then let us tell the sweet story, triumphantly, lincoln is dead.

 it was biting cold, and the falling snow, which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, crying, “who’ll buy my matches? for i want pennies to buy some meat!”  when she left home she had slippers on; but, alas! poor child, now they were gone. for she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.  so the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; and the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, for nobody had bought any matches that day, which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.  alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; so in a corner between two houses she made bold to take shelter from the violent storm. poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.  and she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home for fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, and to go home without pennies she was in dread.  the large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; while the passers-by for her had no care, as they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, while the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.  as night wore on her hands were numb with cold, and no longer her strength could her uphold, when an idea into her little head came: she’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.  and she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, and it helped to fill her heart with glee; and she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; but, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!  her body was found half-covered with snow, and as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; and many present let fall a burning tear because she was found dead on the last night of the year,  in that mighty city of london, wherein is plenty of gold— but, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold. but i hope the match girl’s in heaven, beside her saviour dear, a bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

 they peopled landscapes casually like trees, being there richly, never having gone there, and whether clanning in cities or village-thin stands were reticent as trees with those not born there, and their fate, like trees, was seldom in their hands.  others to them were always one of two evils: the colonist or refugee. they stared back, half disdaining us, half fearing; inferring from our looks their destiny as preservation or as clearing.  i envied them. to be local was to know which team to support: the local team; where to drop in for a pint with mates: the local; best of all to feel by birthright welcome anywhere; be everywhere a local...  bedouin-brython-algonquins; always there before you; the original prior claim that made your being anywhere intrusive. there, doubtless, in eden before adam wiped them out and settled in with eve.  whether at home or away, whether kids playing or saying what they wanted, or adults chatting, waiting for a bus, or, in their well-tended graves, the contented dead, there were always locals, and they were never us.

 who has not waked to list the busy sounds of summer’s morning, in the sultry smoke of noisy london? on the pavement hot the sooty chimney-boy, with dingy face and tattered covering, shrilly bawls his trade, rousing the sleepy housemaid. at the door the milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell proclaims the dustman’s office; while the street is lost in clouds impervious. now begins the din of hackney-coaches, waggons, carts; while tinmen’s shops, and noisy trunk-makers, knife-grinders, coopers, squeaking cork-cutters, fruit-barrows, and the hunger-giving cries of vegetable-vendors, fill the air. now every shop displays its varied trade, and the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet of early walkers. at the private door the ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop, annoying the smart ’prentice, or neat girl, tripping with band-box lightly. now the sun darts burning splendor on the glittering pane, save where the canvas awning throws a shade on the gay merchandise. now, spruce and trim, in shops (where beauty smiles with industry) sits the smart damsel; while the passenger peeps through the window, watching every charm. now pastry dainties catch the eye minute of humming insects, while the limy snare waits to enthrall them. now the lamp-lighter mounts the tall ladder, nimbly venturous, to trim the half-filled lamps, while at his feet the pot-boy yells discordant! all along the sultry pavement, the old-clothes-man cries in tone monotonous, while sidelong views the area for his traffic: now the bag is slyly opened, and the half-worn suit (sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base domestic spoiler), for one half its worth, sinks in the green abyss. the porter now bears his huge load along the burning way; and the poor poet wakes from busy dreams, to paint the summer morning.

 confess: it’s my profession that alarms you. this is why few people ask me to dinner, though lord knows i don’t go out of my way to be scary. i wear dresses of sensible cut and unalarming shades of beige, i smell of lavender and go to the hairdresser’s: no prophetess mane of mine, complete with snakes, will frighten the youngsters. if i roll my eyes and mutter, if i clutch at my heart and scream in horror like a third-rate actress chewing up a mad scene, i do it in private and nobody sees but the bathroom mirror.  in general i might agree with you: women should not contemplate war, should not weigh tactics impartially, or evade the word enemy , or view both sides and denounce nothing. women should march for peace, or hand out white feathers to arouse bravery, spit themselves on bayonets to protect their babies, whose skulls will be split anyway, or, having been raped repeatedly, hang themselves with their own hair. these are the functions that inspire general comfort. that, and the knitting of socks for the troops and a sort of moral cheerleading. also: mourning the dead. sons, lovers, and so forth. all the killed children.  instead of this, i tell what i hope will pass as truth. a blunt thing, not lovely. the truth is seldom welcome, especially at dinner, though i am good at what i do. my trade is courage and atrocities. i look at them and do not condemn. i write things down the way they happened, as near as can be remembered. i don’t ask why , because it is mostly the same. wars happen because the ones who start them think they can win.  in my dreams there is glamour. the vikings leave their fields each year for a few months of killing and plunder, much as the boys go hunting. in real life they were farmers. they come back loaded with splendour. the arabs ride against crusaders with scimitars that could sever silk in the air. a swift cut to the horse’s neck and a hunk of armour crashes down like a tower. fire against metal. a poet might say: romance against banality. when awake, i know better.  despite the propaganda, there are no monsters, or none that can be finally buried. finish one off, and circumstances and the radio create another. believe me: whole armies have prayed fervently to god all night and meant it, and been slaughtered anyway. brutality wins frequently, and large outcomes have turned on the invention of a mechanical device, viz. radar. true, valour sometimes counts for something, as at thermopylae. sometimes being right— though ultimate virtue, by agreed tradition, is decided by the winner. sometimes men throw themselves on grenades and burst like paper bags of guts to save their comrades. i can admire that. but rats and cholera have won many wars. those, and potatoes, or the absence of them. it’s no use pinning all those medals across the chests of the dead. impressive, but i know too much. grand exploits merely depress me.  in the interests of research i have walked on many battlefields that once were liquid with pulped men’s bodies and spangled with exploded shells and splayed bone. all of them have been green again by the time i got there. each has inspired a few good quotes in its day. sad marble angels brood like hens over the grassy nests where nothing hatches. (the angels could just as well be described as vulgar  or pitiless , depending on camera angle.) the word glory figures a lot on gateways. of course i pick a flower or two from each, and press it in the hotel bible for a souvenir. i’m just as human as you.  but it’s no use asking me for a final statement. as i say, i deal in tactics. also statistics: for every year of peace there have been four hundred years of war.

 for daniel “chappie” james, general usaf  and for the 332d fighter group being black in america was the original catch, so no one was surprised by 22: the segregated airstrips, separate camps. they did the jobs they’d been trained to do.  black ground crews kept them in the air; black flight surgeons kept them alive; the whole group removed their headgear when another pilot died.  they were known by their names: “ace” and “lucky,” “sky-hawk johnny,” “mr. death.” and by their positions and planes. red leader to yellow wing-man, do you copy?  if you could find a fresh egg you bought it and hid it in your dopp-kit or your boot until you could eat it alone. on the night before a mission you gave a buddy your hiding-places as solemnly as a man dictating his will. there’s a chocolate bar in my bible; my whiskey bottle is inside my bedroll.  in beat-up flying tigers that had seen action in burma, they shot down three german jets. they were the only outfit in the american air corps to sink a destroyer with fighter planes. fighter planes with names like “by request.” sometimes the radios didn’t even work.  they called themselves “hell from heaven.” this spookwaffe. my father’s old friends.  it was always maximum effort: a whole squadron of brother-men raced across the tarmac and mounted their planes.  my tent-mate was a guy named starks. the funny thing about me and starks was that my air mattress leaked, and starks’ didn’t. every time we went up, i gave my mattress to starks and put his on my cot.  one day we were strafing a train. strafing’s bad news: you have to fly so low and slow you’re a pretty clear target. my other wing-man and i exhausted our ammunition and got out. i recognized starks by his red tail and his rudder’s trim-tabs. he couldn’t pull up his nose. he dived into the train and bought the farm.  i found his chocolate, three eggs, and a full fifth of his hoarded-up whiskey. i used his mattress for the rest of my tour.  it still bothers me, sometimes: i was sleeping on his breath.

 (we can succeed only by concert. . . . the dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. the occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. we must disenthrall ourselves. . . . december 1, 1862. the president’s message to congress.) be sad, be cool, be kind, remembering those now dreamdust hallowed in the ruts and gullies, solemn bones under the smooth blue sea, faces warblown in a falling rain.  be a brother, if so can be, to those beyond battle fatigue each in his own corner of earth or forty fathoms undersea beyond all boom of guns, beyond any bong of a great bell, each with a bosom and number, each with a pack of secrets, each with a personal dream and doorway and over them now the long endless winds with the low healing song of time, the hush and sleep murmur of time.  make your wit a guard and cover. sing low, sing high, sing wide. let your laughter come free remembering looking toward peace: “we must disenthrall ourselves.”  be a brother, if so can be, to those thrown forward for taking hardwon lines, for holding hardwon points and their reward so-so, little they care to talk about, their pay held in a mute calm, highspot memories going unspoken, what they did being past words, what they took being hardwon. be sad, be kind, be cool. weep if you must and weep open and shameless before these altars.  there are wounds past words. there are cripples less broken than many who walk whole. there are dead youths with wrists of silence who keep a vast music under their shut lips, what they did being past words, their dreams like their deaths beyond any smooth and easy telling, having given till no more to give.  there is dust alive with dreams of the republic, with dreams of the family of man flung wide on a shrinking globe with old timetables, old maps, old guide-posts torn into shreds, shot into tatters burnt in a firewind, lost in the shambles, faded in rubble and ashes.  there is dust alive. out of a granite tomb, out of a bronze sarcophagus, loose from the stone and copper steps a whitesmoke ghost lifting an authoritative hand in the name of dreams worth dying for, in the name of men whose dust breathes of those dreams so worth dying for, what they did being past words, beyond all smooth and easy telling.  be sad, be kind, be cool, remembering, under god, a dreamdust hallowed in the ruts and gullies, solemn bones under the smooth blue sea, faces warblown in a falling rain.  sing low, sing high, sing wide. make your wit a guard and cover. let your laughter come free like a help and a brace of comfort.  the earth laughs, the sun laughs over every wise harvest of man, over man looking toward peace by the light of the hard old teaching: “we must disenthrall ourselves.”

 i am looking for the photo that would make all the difference in my life. it’s very small and subject to fits of amnesia, turning up in poker hands, grocery carts, under the unturned stone. the photo shows me at the lost and found looking for an earlier photo, the one that would have made all the difference then. my past evades me like a politician. wielding a fly-swatter, it destroys my collection of cereal boxes, my childhood lived close to the breakfast table. only that photo can help me locate my fourteen lost children, who look just like me. when i call the bureau of missing persons, they say, “try the bureau of missing photos.” they have a fine collection. here’s one of calvin coolidge’s seventh wedding. here’s one of a man going over a cliff on a dogsled. here’s my uncle arthur the night he bought the prize peacock. o photo! end your tour of the world in a hot air balloon. resign your job at the mirror-testing laboratory. come home to me, you little fool, before i find i can live without you.

NEW POEM
 where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles, miles and miles on the solitary pastures where our sheep half-asleep tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop as they crop— was the site once of a city great and gay, (so they say) of our country's very capital, its prince ages since held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far peace or war.  now the country does not even boast a tree, as you see, to distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills from the hills intersect and give a name to, (else they run into one) where the domed and daring palace shot its spires up like fires o'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall bounding all made of marble, men might march on nor be prest twelve abreast.  and such plenty and perfection, see, of grass never was! such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads and embeds every vestige of the city, guessed alone, stock or stone— where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe long ago; lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame struck them tame; and that glory and that shame alike, the gold bought and sold.  now—the single little turret that remains on the plains, by the caper overrooted, by the gourd overscored, while the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks through the chinks— marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time sprang sublime, and a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced as they raced, and the monarch and his minions and his dames viewed the games.  and i know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve smiles to leave to their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece in such peace, and the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey melt away— that a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair waits me there in the turret whence the charioteers caught soul for the goal, when the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb till i come.  but he looked upon the city, every side, far and wide, all the mountains topped with temples, all the glades' colonnades, all the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then all the men! when i do come, she will speak not, she will stand, either hand on my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace of my face, ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech each on each.  in one year they sent a million fighters forth south and north, and they built their gods a brazen pillar high as the sky yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— gold, of course. o heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns! earth's returns for whole centuries of folly, noise and sin! shut them in, with their triumphs and their glories and the rest! love is best.  
NEW POEM
 when i stood behind his desk chair and when he sat, on rare occasions, on the porch, “sage of anacostia,” they called him, i smelled his mane glorious, and as a hand saddle the aroma of hair took me to neckline and below. in egypt, long after napoleon had shot off the face of the sphinx, i thought of this man, and the cusp of his palms on my shoulder blades; as always he was carrying the mail of gender, his touch immaculate in the true blend of the cortex, and of the complex, risen on a pulpit, and after the hot air, wintry parlance, the syllables of my name in his ear, when he touched me, as he had touched me then. i had my suspicions of english ladies, actresses, ghosts of the thames, concubines, as we had been into this next century. and they had their wiles with him.  i do not feel forbidden; the cameo ring he gave me, recession of his maleness all i need, and highlights of my dark profile, any children we might have had buried in architecture, and the hate of his daughter rosetta, who i have spoken to over the grate.  the sun rises and sets in our neighborhood: i will burn these. but when i place my fingers in that mane it is to the saddle he will come.  
NEW POEM
 this is how it is with me: so strong, i want to draw the egg from your womb and nourish it in my own. i want to mother your child made only of us, of me, you: no borrowed seed from any man. i want to re-fashion the matrix of creation, make a human being from the human love that passes between our bodies. sweetheart, this is how it is: when you emerge from the bedroom in a clean cotton shirt, sleeves pushed back over forearms, scented with cologne from an amber bottle—i want to open my heart, the brightest aching slit of my soul, receive your pearl. i watch your hands, wait for the sign that means you’ll touch me, open me, fill me; wait for that moment when your desire leaps inside me.  
NEW POEM
 mugoo was a sweeper boy and the cleanest of the sweeper caste. he would leap at the blush of dawn to clean the paths and the steps spotless.  gugoo was a bootmaker girl who made boots. gugoo was higher caste than mugoo. by rights he was the floor and she was the foot that trod.  yet after work, while the boys and girls played at tug of war, wrestling, or archery, shy boy mugoo and shy girl gugoo would draw the boys and girls.  the children smiling at the shining visions would hug mugoo and gugoo. then that couple would bury the drawings for fear their elders feel scandalized.  in manhood for mugoo and womanhood for gugoo, how hard that gugoo thread boots for her father when she had no golden stitch for the gaping hole  in her soul. how hard that mugoo scrub the lanes! who dare be swept away from the law of caste by the foul stamp and passport of besotted love?  yet the hairs at their ears, their nipples, bomped by a mere sultana breeze. then the swirling night when they’d escape for arabia than stay near-far    ...  in mugoo and gugoo love was a rabbit leaping on a radish when they became runaway lovers! like hares under the sketched moon they bobbed in the grunch  wind before the tossed river. timorous gugoo to timorous mugoo, “is it not said the pure of heart are able to turn water into solid crystal orbs?”  “i have heard it gugoo. let us swim till the waters turn dot by dot into crystal orbs, slowly mounting up for us a solid path so we can bobble across.”  that cub-like couple held on a first-ever daredevil cuddle. then snuck a parched kiss! and fell into their dive across punjab’s muggur of an ogre — the  river ravi! they were soon to learn the blunderous water was bigger than they; they were dabbing onwards on the spot; directionless comical pups; pawdawdling    ...  only death was woken by their swallowed screams. at the sight of a cutesome pair brinked for his maw death’s thin lips aah’d and coo’d. to tickle himself  death tipped a witching shriek in the eardrums of the ferryman, charan, who was rank in a dream. charan swore at death, “what bastard panchod  is unheroing my dream? i was the river god riding the turmeric sea when the fisher king’s red bill fished me up a buxom masala mermaid!”  death hushed charan. bundled him into the boat. charan, still swearing, fished for a scream-trail, for bunny-like feet in the sudden dead-stop river    ...  next morning, by the prophecy of the snake-priest, the villagers arrived at the shame-faced riverbank. charan, in his guzzy saffron turban, was blaring  at the crowd about a passion crime. huffing too had arrived the muscly cobbler and sweeper fathers. all heard charan, “i am my own king of the sticks!  i row two weeks that way to the flowers of kashmir the gold-haired men with their bloated bags of honey, and one week that way for the spices of samarkand  with the red-fingered sellers of kalonji, saffron, jeera. today i catch by the feet a fresh parable of a kutcha- pucka business. i sing it for only one rupee each!”  all looked down by charan’s sandal’d feet. dared to be rolled in the same shivering blanket (like a chapati rolled around saag paneer)  yet fearing to be parted, yet tenuously panting were mugoo and gugoo! the frail couple like shy red squirrels, “o father, we love you. but. most we are    ...  loving this: this that is my soul’s mirror. mugoo is my gugoo: gugoo is my mugoo.” the bony youths clung sauced together. stiffed for the glooping apart.  the bootmaker father been crunching his own fists, the sweeper father been hurling daggers from his eyes, as the crowd fell silent, the fathers spoke as one,  “what draws them out of caste, their underhand idle drawings. such fancy is inking good for nothing.” gugoo and mugoo raised their necks, “if all hearts  were good for nothing, could love from each for each blow as one?” the apricot breeze blew a soft cadence but could it push the dominion of the communal mind  past its bound and daily utility? could sweet nothings clear the world free of blood fear? of sweet-faced mugoo and gugoo in a threadbare pleading, “do not  part us.” from their mild rhetoric and politic of love the hills and valleys had swooned into blossoms of heaven, and had set the scene with gaudiest cheeks.  so who dare part them? o love, be roused, take arms and wound for the cause of love! or at least shackle the shadows that deepened into that tinsy couple.

 the flag is folded lengthwise, and lengthwise again, folding toward the open edge, so that the union of stars on the blue field remains outward in full view; a triangular folding is then begun at the striped end, by bringing the corner of the folded edge to the open edge; the outer point, turned inward along the open edge, forms the next triangular fold: the folding continued so, until the end is reached, the final corner tucked between the folds of the blue union, the form of the folded flag is found to resemble that of a 3-cornered pouch, or thick cocked hat.  take this flag, john glenn, instead of a friend; instead of a brother, edward kennedy, take this flag; instead of a father, joe kennedy, take this flag; this flag instead of a husband, ethel kennedy, take this flag; this 9-times-folded red-white-striped, star-spotted-blue flag, tucked and pocketed neatly, nation, instead of a leader, take this folded flag. robert kennedy, coffin without coverlet, beside this hole in the grass, beside your brother, john kennedy, in the grass, take, instead of a country, this folded flag; robert kennedy, take this hole in the grass.  
NEW POEM
 travel is a vanishing act only to those who are left behind. what the traveler knows is that he accompanies himself, unwieldy baggage that can’t be checked, stolen, or lost, or mistaken. so one took, past outposts of empire, “calmly as if in the british museum,” not only her victorian skirts, starched shirtwaists, and umbrella, but her faith in the civilizing mission of women, her backaches and insomnia, her innocent valor; another, friend of witch-doctors, living on native chop, trading tobacco and hooks for fish and fetishes, heralded her astonishing arrival under shivering stars by calling, “it’s only me!” a third, intent on savage customs, and to demonstrate that a woman could travel as easily as a man, carried a handkerchief damp with wifely tears and only once permitted a tribal chieftain to stroke her long, golden hair.

 the kilted porter shook my hand in welcome, drained it of blood and gave me back my luggage. i signed the register in my own name for the first time in my life of low celebrity. in the lounge bar, there were pictures by margarita but no sign of margaritas by the pitcher. all night, the couple in the next-door room failed noisily to make love even once. the signature tune of the air conditioning was a surface b-side for any one-hit-wonder. weary, i ordered up the late night menu from room service, but sleep wasn’t on it so, after an hour of mentally undressing myself, i donned the pyjamas with the killer bee motif and there on the bed i wrote a dozen identical postcards to friends i’d forgotten. no doubt to keep the cold tap company, the hot tap had opted to be a cold tap too. funnel-web spiders wove their lazy way toward each other across the scarlet ceiling and when i solved the riddle of the shower, no blood came gushing, but no water either. by the bed, a gideon bible in esperanto and a phone-book listing lumsdens of the world; in the mini-bar, flat vimto and a half-pint of someone else’s mother’s milk, turned to fur. the tv had one channel, showing highlights from my worst performances in every sphere. at three, in the courtyard, a chambermaid choir sang a barbershop version of ‘i will survive’. the only time i dared to close my eyes, dervishes under the bed began to talk dirty. when i left at nine and settled my check, they told me clearly don't come back.

 for scott harris last summer’s fishing failures dangled from trees: a rapala and jitterbug a stand of privet paid for, half-ounce jigs with rubber skirts and jelly worms with wide-gap hooks on ten-pound test we tithed with overzealous casts at bass. then off we’d go (our stringers bare) to find a yard to cut, a truck to wash, so we could fill the tackle box we shared again. today is 12/12/12, the mayan end, and i, a country boy in brooklyn for the week, will hail a cab for the first time and think of cows unnerved by fish we missed and shouts of “shit” that followed, and dawns to dusks and always back with you, my childhood friend. our girls will never know that pond’s deep hole a baseball diamond now fills — the city leaders’ bright idea — or how their fathers sitting in the bleachers on saturdays a couple decades later can almost feel the stinging nettle against their thighs, the lunker largemouth sweeping the bed with her tail while plastic lizards jerk and drag across the third base line, or how when we untrain our ears to baseballs cracking bats and bitchy parents, called strikes and alike, we hear the peepers sounding off in oaks on down the way, our mothers’ and fathers’ voices calling us home not too far behind or ahead.  
NEW POEM
 outside the party thick throng the snow-flakes, the evening is dreary, glad rings the music in yonder gay hall; on her who listens here, friendless and weary, heavier chill than the winter’s doth fall.  at yon clear window, light-opened before me, glances the face i have worshipped so well: there’s the fine gentleman, grand in his glory; there, the fair smile by whose sweetness i fell.  this is akin to him, shunned and forsaken, that at my bosom sobs low, without bread; had not such pleading my marble heart shaken, i had been quiet, long since, with the dead.  oh! could i enter there, ghastly and squalid, stand in men’s eyes with my spirit o’erborne, show them where roses bloomed, crushed now and pallid, what he found innocent, leaving forlorn,—  how the fair ladies would fail from their dances, trembling, aghast at my horrible tale! how would he shrink from my words and my glances! how would they shrink from him, swooning and pale!  this is the hair that was soft to enchain him; snakelike, it snarls on my beautiless brow: these are the hands that were fond to detain him with a sense-magic then, powerless now!  no: could i come, like a ghost, to affright him, how should that heal my wound, silence my pain? had i the wrath of god’s lightning to smite him, that could not bring me my lost peace again.  ne’er let him grieve while good fortunes betide him, ne’er count again the poor game lost of old; when he comes forth, with his young bride beside him, here shall they find us both, dead in the cold.

 varus, varus, gib mir meine legionen wieder quick on my feet in those novembers of my loneliness, i tossed a short pass, almost the instant i got the ball, right over the head of barrel terry before he knocked me cold.  when i woke, i found myself crying out latin conjugations, and the new snow falling at the edge of a green field.  lemoyne crone had caught the pass, while i lay unconscious and raging alone with the fire ghost of catullus, the contemptuous graces tossing garlands and hendecasyllabics over the head of cornelius nepos the mastodon, the huge volume.  at the edges of southeast asia this afternoon the quarterbacks and the lines are beginning to fall, a spring snow,  and terrified young men quick on their feet lob one another’s skulls across wings of strange birds that are burning themselves alive.

 by menopause, it’s not just estrogen my mother lacks. she’s lost her eldest son— that’s me, the one who’s queer—the doctor who once made her very proud. these days, i do my own wash when i’m home, i cook for her so she can take a break from all the chores she now refuses to assign to me. she sits, half-watching ricki through her tea’s thin steam, her squint of disapproval more denial than it is disgust. she hears much better than she sees—it’s easier to keep out vision than it is to clear the air of sounds—and yet i know it’s age that stultifies her senses too. enraged because she’s lost so much, i understand why suddenly she looks so stunned as from the television: “. . . bitch, she stole my boyfriend, my own mother did! . . .” i fold a towel noiselessly. i know she thinks it’s garbage, sinful, crap—just as she thinks that taking estrogen in pills is not what god intended, no matter what the doctors say; or that i’m gay is plain unnatural, she can’t endure such pain. the oven timer rings. the cookies that i’ve baked are done. i’ll make another batch though she won’t touch them: given up for lent. my mother’s love. i wonder where it went.

 the courage to let go of the door, the handle. the courage to shed the familiar walls whose very stains and leaks are comfortable as the little moles of the upper arm; stains that recall a feast, a child’s naughtiness, a loud blattering storm that slapped the roof hard, pouring through.  the courage to abandon the graves dug into the hill, the small bones of children and the brittle bones of the old whose marrow hunger had stolen; the courage to desert the tree planted and only begun to bear; the riverside where promises were shaped; the street where their empty pots were broken.  the courage to leave the place whose language you learned as early as your own, whose customs however dan- gerous or demeaning, bind you like a halter you have learned to pull inside, to move your load; the land fertile with the blood spilled on it; the roads mapped and annotated for survival.  the courage to walk out of the pain that is known into the pain that cannot be imagined, mapless, walking into the wilderness, going barefoot with a canteen into the desert; stuffed in the stinking hold of a rotting ship sailing off the map into dragons’ mouths,  cathay, india, siberia, goldeneh medina 2  leaving bodies by the way like abandoned treasure. so they walked out of egypt. 3 so they bribed their way out of russia under loads of straw; so they steamed out of the bloody smoking charnelhouse of europe on overloaded freighters forbidden all ports—  out of pain into death or freedom or a different painful dignity, into squalor and politics. we jews are all born of wanderers, with shoes under our pillows and a memory of blood that is ours raining down. we honor only those jews who changed tonight, those who chose the desert over bondage,  who walked into the strange and became strangers and gave birth to children who could look down on them standing on their shoulders for having been slaves. we honor those who let go of every- thing but freedom, who ran, who revolted, who fought, who became other by saving themselves.       * a popular preacher or an angel who conveys, in mysterious ways, teachings only to scholars worthy ofl such communications (hebrew). 2. golden land (yiddish). 3. a reference to the biblical exodus out of egypt.

 after jim steinmeyer’s book “hiding the elephant: how magicians invented the impossible and learned to disappear” over the years they hunted, the wayward apprentice watchmakers, the disappointing sons who transformed their surnames, hunted over acres of hinges, cogs, calluses, hidden whiskey, mustaches a breath from feral, poured an ocean of fortune into fabrications of brass and iron, spent entire seasons strumming massive harps of wire into perfect calibrations of invisibility, prayed to the gods of adjustable mirrors, cursed the gods of temperamental gaslights, broke the legs of imitators and thieves, chewed holes in each other’s pockets, harnessed nightmares of giant silver hoops making endless passes over the bodies of the dead, hoisted high a cenotaph for hundreds of sacrificed rabbits, breathed miles of delicate thread into the lost labyrinths of their lungs, all to make a woman float to make a woman float and none of them ever thought of simply asking her.

 when he had suckled there, he began to grow: first, he was an infant in her arms, but soon, drinking and drinking at the sweet milk she could not keep from filling her, from pouring into his ravenous mouth, and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was huge, towering above her, the landscape, his shadow stealing the color from the fields, even the flowers going gray. and they came like ants, one behind the next, to worship him—huge as he was, and hungry; it was his hunger they admired most of all. so they brought him slaughtered beasts: goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own kin whose hunger was a kind of shame to them, a shrinkage; even as his was beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.  the day came when they had nothing left to offer him, having denuded themselves of all in order to enlarge him, in whose shadow they dreamed of light: and that is when the thought began to move, small at first, a whisper, then a buzz, and finally, it broke out into words, so loud they thought it must be prophecy: they would kill him, and all they had lost in his name would return, renewed and fresh with the dew of morning. hope fed their rage, sharpened their weapons.  and who is she, hooded figure, mourner now at the fate of what she fed? and the slow rain, which never ends, who is the father of that? and who are we who speak, as if the world were our diorama—its little figures moved by hidden gears, precious in miniature, tin soldiers, spears the size of pins, perfect replicas, history under glass, dusty, old fashioned, a curiosity that no one any longer wants to see, excited as they are by the new giant, who feeds on air, grows daily on radio waves, in cyberspace, who sows darkness like a desert storm, who blows like a wind through the boardrooms, who touches the hills, and they smoke.

 so that the truant boy may go steady with the state, so that in his spine a memory of wings will make his shoulders tense &amp; bend like a thing already flown when the bracelets of another school of love are fastened to his wrists, make a law that doesn’t have to wait long until someone comes along to break it.  so that in jail he will have the time to read how the king was beheaded &amp; the hawk that rode the king’s wrist died of a common cold, and learn that chivalry persists, and what first felt like an insult to the flesh was the blank ‘o’ of love. put the fun back into punishment. make a law that loves the one who breaks it.  so that no empty court will make a  judge recall ice fishing on some overcast bay, shivering in the cold beside his father, it ought to be an interesting law, the kind of thing that no one can obey, a law that whispers “break me.” let the crows roost &amp; caw. a good judge is an example to us all.  so that the patrolman can still whistle “the yellow rose of texas” through his teeth and even show some faint gesture of respect while he cuffs the suspect, not ungently, &amp; says things like  ok , that’s it  
NEW POEM
 a voice from the dark called out, ‘the poets must give us imagination of peace, to oust the intense, familiar imagination of disaster. peace, not only the absence of war.’ but peace, like a poem, is not there ahead of itself, can’t be imagined before it is made, can’t be known except in the words of its making, grammar of justice, syntax of mutual aid. a feeling towards it, dimly sensing a rhythm, is all we have until we begin to utter its metaphors, learning them as we speak. a line of peace might appear if we restructured the sentence our lives are making, revoked its reaffirmation of profit and power, questioned our needs, allowed long pauses . . . a cadence of peace might balance its weight on that different fulcrum; peace, a presence, an energy field more intense than war, might pulse then, stanza by stanza into the world, each act of living one of its words, each word a vibration of light—facets of the forming crystal.

NEW POEM
 under the french horns of a november afternoon a man in blue is raking leaves with a wide wooden rake (whose teeth are pegs or rather, dowels). next door boys play soccer: “you got to start over!” sort of. a round attic window in a radiant gray house waits like a kettledrum. “you got to start . . .” the brahmsian day lapses from waltz to march. the grass, rough-cropped as bruno walter’s hair, is stretched, strewn and humped beneath a sycamore wide and high as an idea of heaven in which brahms turns his face like a bearded thumb and says, “there is something i must tell you!” to bruno walter. “in the first movement of my second, think of it as a family planning where to go next summer in terms of other summers. a material ecstasy, subdued, recollective.” bruno walter in a funny jacket with a turned-up collar says, “let me sing it for you.” he waves his hands and through the vocalese-shaped spaces of naked elms he draws a copper beech ignited with a few late leaves. he bluely glazes a rhododendron “a sea of leaves” against gold grass. there is a snapping from the brightwork of parked and rolling cars. there almost has to be a heaven! so there could be a place for bruno walter who never needed the cry of a baton. immortality— in a small, dusty, rather gritty, somewhat scratchy magnavox from which a forte drops like a used brillo pad? frayed. but it’s hard to think of the sky as a thick glass floor with thick-soled viennese boots tromping about on it. it’s a whole lot harder thinking of brahms in something soft, white, and flowing. “life,” he cries (here, in the last movement), “is something more than beer and skittles!” “and the something more is a whole lot better than beer and skittles,” says bruno walter, darkly, under the sod. i don’t suppose it seems so dark to a root. who are these men in evening coats? what are these thumps? where is brahms? and bruno walter? ensconced in resonant plump easy chairs covered with scuffed brown leather in a pungent autumn that blends leaf smoke (sycamore, tobacco, other), their nobility wound in a finale like this calico cat asleep, curled up in a breadbasket, on a sideboard where the sun falls.

 they dropped the charges of homicide, filed new charges of terrorism, dropped the charges of terrorism, filed new charges of public nudity, dropped the charges of public nudity, filed new charges of lewd and lascivious behavior. a spokesman for the fbi said they found him on the hood of an suv in a part of town known as the “fruit loop”. his penis was in another man’s mouth and in the front seat were vials containing a rare strand of bacteria known to cause blindness in rats. they dropped the charges of public nudity and filed new charged of sodomy. a spokesman for the police department said they found him with his pants down and it appeared that his penis was in another man’s anus. but since they could not prove to what degree his penis had penetrated the other man’s anus they dropped the charges of sodomy and filed new charges of assault and battery. a spokesman for the department of homeland security said that he assaulted a worker from the department of public health who used a q-tip to extract from inside of his urethra a rare strand of bacteria capable of causing pneumonia in chickens. he was placed in solitary confinement and a spokesman for the department of corrections suggested that he was a serious threat to the community. they examined the strand of bacteria found in his urethra but since they did not properly store the bacteria in the appropriate container with the appropriate seals and signatures they could not charge him with intent to commit crimes against humanity. they dropped the charges of intent to commit crimes against humanity and filed new charges of larceny. they said he had stolen the rare strand of bacteria from his employer and that he had done so with the deliberate and malicious intent to harm as many civilians as possible. they tried to verify for whom he had worked during the given time period but since they could not verify the name or location of his employer they dropped the charges of larceny and filed new charges of tax fraud. when they discovered he was privately employed, they dropped the charges of tax fraud and filed new charges of theft with an unregistered weapon. a grocery store in his neighborhood had recently been robbed and the cashier said that the thief had carried the same model of weapon that the man in question kept beneath his bed in case of emergencies. they dropped the charges of theft with an unregistered weapon when they discovered the cashier was partially blind and that the weapon the man in question kept beneath his bed in case of emergencies had been properly purchased and registered. when they found on his bookshelves several works of fiction with blind characters, including king lear,oedipus rex,endgame, and blindness by josé saramago, they accused him of conspiring to use the rare strand of bacteria to blind not only the grocer but the seven other blind residents of his neighborhood, each of whom had had perfectly good eyesight until he came to town. they asked him why he had so many books about blindness, but he refused to answer the question. they asked him why he had so many books about blindness and when his attorney arrived the man in question said that he did not know why he had so many books about blindness. they asked his friends and family why he had so many books about blindness. no one knew why he had so many books about blindness and they accused him in the press of anti-social behavior. when his neighbors testified that the man in question enjoyed society as much as he enjoyed a quiet night at home, they dropped the charges of anti-social behavior. they dropped the charges of anti-social behavior and filed new charges of jaywalking. an undercover police officer filmed him with a video camera as he illegally crossed the street. at the advice of his attorney, he pleaded guilty to the charges of jaywalking. he agreed to pay the fine.

 she always got mad at him every time he came home in the middle of the morning with his pant legs wet. she knew he had fallen in the ditch again. his legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches. he was too old to be walking over temporary dikes. she wished he didn’t do that, but sometimes he had to. she sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches, his head hitting hard cement, his body slowly sinking into the water. water that was only three feet deep. a harmless three feet of water, where children played, and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet, especially on hot summer evening. she knew he would drown, she knew it was bound to happen sometime.  as far as the eye could see, flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains. mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like. fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage place beneath the earth’s surface.  we are called “the people of the cotton fields” because of the labor our families did. for us there was no reservation, no housing &amp; urban development, no tribal support. we were a people segregated in row houses all lined up along the roads of our labor.  it is a muggy summer evening. my father, my sister, and i sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun. the change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally, to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.  on this evening the anticipation is shattered. a boy comes to the house. he gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing. with what the boy says to him my father moves quickly. as quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him. back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy. he rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat. he gets into his truck and drives away.  we pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing. a second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off. in a tone i recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her. she starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house. my sister and i walk beside her. saying nothing. her hands wring the towel she carries with her. this towel, a multipurpose kind of thing. women carry it to fan themselves, to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies. i remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university. whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.  we continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton. rows of cotton my family and i know well. in early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth, and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals. and in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks. now i can’t begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked, up and back, up and back along these rows.  we walk alongside her. the setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs, the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms. she heads toward the irrigation ditch. the ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery. the water is shallow. i see my father’s truck pulling up on the opposite side. in the front seat there are women, and in the back, men. the men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes. equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields. i remember the hoe he carried. it was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done. i recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship. “they call this a hoe?” i said to my husband. it had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of. the handle was too thin, causing blisters. once in awhile i look around for the type of hoe my father carried. i found one once, but didn’t have money to buy it.  in slow motion, weighed down by the heat, the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck. they slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging. in cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch. my mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string, is pulled toward them from the opposite side. their movement is dreamlike. they peer into the muddy water. and as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying, motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces. with a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail. this sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.

 for ofelia camacho delgado she wakes to the odor of sheep, trying to rub it off her hands. dressed up in her native colors, standing by a tourist van, she is a dandelion, golden like the alpaca woven buttons of her sweater. she is done with the tourists taking her photo, holding a baby lamb.  without official papers in a new country, she briskly walks, and obscenely slow, a foreign tongue slithers by; its scales are the words she has not yet learned to trust. the baby girl hiding in her belly's nest will learn quechua first,runa.                      the people  the sick horses are pushed off the deck of a ship bound for cuba. pursuing, their heads bobbing, clearing the salt from their nostrils, they kick. as long as they can, they swim in the rushing swells, falling behind the ship's scent, swine and men.  know someone who needs their spirits lifted? why not try a lavender or a rose scent?  at the end of a hallway, a machine rattles and spits out ice cubes, some dropping, transparent on the dull vines of the carpet. manuela pushes a cart of towels, shampoo, lotion, and soap bars scented with rose oil. glancing down at the "do not disturb" signs, she walks past the banker taking his third shower and the mother nursing her twins on a blanket spread across the floor. the peepholes are silent as a pile of dirty pillows, some dark never blinking, others bullet holes of light. before leaving the day's inn on mt. vernon, she steals a few soap bars for her daughter, who places them in her dresser drawers, scenting her lingerie, fresh as cut flowers.  a dandelion's root, far deeper, tolerant of drought and poor soil, is not an easily uprooted presence.  manuela hears the creaking of planks, the flapping of sails, and horses stomping, nervous, eyeing the full moon. she sees the marks of hooves in the sand, marks coming out from the sea and vanishing inland. she wakes to that odor again.  this time she stands beside her incan city, its green peaks cutting the sky open, painted on la carreta restaurant's wall. her daughter is taking her photo, saying,"sonríe, mami , sonríe.""smile, mom, smile."  the blindfolded horses are hoisted on board in belly slings, and their feet are tied, slightly touching the deck, suspended for most of the voyage, but once on land some will escape and revert to the wild.  know someone who needs their spirits lifted? why not try a lavender or a rose scent?  she lets the desert in, wild sage. the desert takes her back home while a farmer's pig crosses the highway. she sees her fake id fly off the dashboard. the wheels of her upside-down car spin: suspended, buckled to her seat, feet dangling, she spots the moon on the shards of her windshield, frozen tears, the peepholes blinking back at her.  death touches down like a hoof. a gust of wind pushes the seeds of dandelions upward, a flock of white, a gauze gown drifting over yuccas. memory is the scent of soap bars taking refuge in a daughter's drawer.

 november 1941 we sat in the park, but there was a war between us, a dead moon over us and all around us the shy and secret whisperings as of the tiny woods animals which in the high forest gather wind-fallen goods before the frost comes.  we praised as lucky all whose sure existence (as of the careless moon, the dutiless squirrels) is not responsible for human history— feeling how our happiness, how hope must mount machine guns which other men yet have the firing of, how liberty is seen in the form of a fighter plane millions look up asking, is it ours?  our despair was temporary but not less painful. over us the moon was quiet about its business, pouring its constant light upon the naked beaches. the squirrels built up their small defenses obliged to the fulfillment of a natural process. their leaf-lined cell, the brilliance of the moon, the winter cannot touch and no touch tarnish.

 for desiray kierra chee in the last days of the fourth world i wished to make a map for those who would climb through the hole in the sky.  my only tools were the desires of humans as they emerged from the killing fields, from the bedrooms and the kitchens.  for the soul is a wanderer with many hands and feet.  the map must be of sand and can’t be read by ordinary light. it must carry fire to the next tribal town, for renewal of spirit.  in the legend are instructions on the language of the land, how it was we forgot to acknowledge the gift, as if we were not in it or of it.  take note of the proliferation of supermarkets and malls, the altars of money. they best describe the detour from grace.  keep track of the errors of our forgetfulness; the fog steals our children while we sleep.  flowers of rage spring up in the depression. monsters are born there of nuclear anger.  trees of ashes wave good-bye to good-bye and the map appears to disappear.  we no longer know the names of the birds here, how to speak to them by their personal names.  once we knew everything in this lush promise.  what i am telling you is real and is printed in a warning on the map. our forgetfulness stalks us, walks the earth behind us, leav- ing a trail of paper diapers, needles, and wasted blood.  an imperfect map will have to do, little one.  the place of entry is the sea of your mother’s blood, your father’s small death as he longs to know himself in another.  there is no exit.  the map can be interpreted through the wall of the intestine—a spiral on the road of knowledge.  you will travel through the membrane of death, smell cooking from the encampment where our relatives make a feast of fresh deer meat and corn soup, in the milky way.  they have never left us; we abandoned them for science.  and when you take your next breath as we enter the fifth world there will be no x, no guidebook with words you can carry.  you will have to navigate by your mother’s voice, renew the song she is singing.  fresh courage glimmers from planets.  and lights the map printed with the blood of history, a map you will have to know by your intention, by the language of suns.  when you emerge note the tracks of the monster slayers where they entered the cities of artificial light and killed what was killing us.  you will see red cliffs. they are the heart, contain the ladder.  a white deer will greet you when the last human climbs from the destruction.  remember the hole of shame marking the act of abandoning our tribal grounds.  we were never perfect.  yet, the journey we make together is perfect on this earth who was once a star and made the same mistakes as humans.  we might make them again, she said.  crucial to finding the way is this: there is no beginning or end.  you must make your own map.

 the memory of sun, it is what they subsist upon down where the jaws snap blindly at whatever passes, where drifter is a meaningless term  and to hunt is to proffer teeth and tongue and ghost-lit lantern into a sea like liquid wind, without prior compass of the way the wind is blowing.  should they be gifted with a corpse whose half-spoilt flesh holds distillate eternal summers spent glittering in the euphotic zone, they will give gross thanks and, in their way, be holy.  in the cartography of sea, they are kin not to dragons nor the stella maris but to your own bright band —  yes, you there, eating your sunlight secondhand from a long-gone grocery display, drinking it from the guts of lazy lemons.

 memory is an old mexican woman sweeping her yard with a broom. she has grown even smaller now, residing at that vanishing point decades after one dies, but at some times, given the right conditions— an ordinary dream, or practically anything in particular— she absolutely looms, assuming the stature she had in the neighborhood.  this was the great valley, and we had swept in to do the grooming. we were on the move, tending what was essentially someone else's garden. memory's yard was all that in miniature, in microcosm: rivers for irrigation, certain plants, certain trees ascertained by season. without formal acknowledgment, she was most certainly the head of a community, american.  memory had been there forever. we settled in around her; we brought the electricity of blues and baptized gospel, ancient adaptations of icons, spices, teas, fireworks, trestles, newly acquired techniques of conflict and healing, common concepts of collective survival. . .  memory was there all the while. her house, her shed, her skin, were all the same— weathered— and she didn't do anything, especially, except hum as she moved; memory, in essence, was unmemorable.  yet, ask any of us who have long since left, who have all but forgotten that adulterated place paved over and parceled out by the powers that be, and what we remember, without even choosing to, is an old woman humming, sweeping, smoothing her yard: memory.

the wing of a dead soul grows into all the lace you see through, foreigner, lice-ridden article of divestment. splendid vices pouring outcomes over the eager cash flow promotions. so many of the dead came to me that their transparencies covered my visage, i’m too near you. don’t you want to see? we came from faraway camps, forsaking the human because it broke our bodies into pieces for the torturer’s pet, who propositions you. there is always a slant on it. the trees must go down; or light affects your eyes badly. we pleaded for an adjustment, before we’d recognizably died. you told me you were a heart, but you were guarding a tower. you said you were a failure, but you helped destroy us. wings all over me, stuck to my skin, there’s no point to it why are you here when there’s nothing? we just don’t believe it.   now not no never you. i wasn’t you. you have to talk to me  my name is irretrievable. no one letting you go because you are prized for not existing except as a body, now not. no i don’t exist, alighting and ghoulishly begging you for a drop of your blood, a morsel of your flesh. yes take some of me, though there are so many others with flesh. but they’re too rich to give. i know they will never let you in, you beautiful kids who haunt the corridors extending through the invisible world, so you can find your way. so you can see past the smoke of disastrous fear acting out of dreams: it creeps everywhere. see how it took them over, for they had no mind to stand against any fantasy the instigators chose. had no minds at all. when i was little, no one told me i’d have to suffer. who can be a child? and the ghoul patiently explains how the wing of a word can extend till the barrier is made, so they can’t see us. if you say beauty, that will be ignored, and we can hide. it was his name a long time ago, before the auctions began. her face then was large and younger. she can be lice or ghoul. i want that, i don’t want action. but i will have to live off bits of you.   the new definition of witch is one who lets them eat you, if  they have to. because you keep regenerating. oh that’s such an oldy,  and all that flying. sometimes they do—the man who showed me a  few things sits all day. the teaching is to let them come as far as  inside you even, empty enough; i can hear them and render affection  why, if there’s nothing? is this nothing? but you are destroyed  we shake all the time. you remind me of someone else i knew.  the wing is inscribed, for involute. not to beg in the offering  of primal services, we have come here. no one would let us tell  anything but our bodily humiliations; had to do differently, not for  redemption, because we are more than redemption. i am my maker.  the shape formed by the bits of mirror glued on is unimportant.  they’re inside my chest and stomach, and they glitter in there.  then if light disattaches, comes up to be spoken, you  can see and you can hear. this is true because each of you has this  too. has all the bright pieces inside: there was nothing else  left to be. then i say it, like these pages, or how they would  love me for hosting them. the earliest people feared them,  and subsequent ones deny the dead. why would i be afraid of  all the people dead and martyred? i thought you were talking  about words. you knew i wasn’t.    dido who had to be delivered from the wrong story:  i want you to know i’m no longer left over. what about our  library, nothing good left there? i want to read the fashion of when you  were old a long time ago. gothic roses in the type; i’m an ancient  had read every the book of before they arrested me.  i had crossed the black plain, i had held tears it was abrupt  to be walked in a herd pushing us, wherever we went to be shot, or  executed in the earlier style. it is a timeless death placed next to the  most beat-up books. only a book can love me now. we’re reading  without real eyes; i’ve read everything too, or in the tradition of  telling it is repeated within you what we did. we must have  been trying to make something as we are now, but why. you  have the ear for it. the light wants you to reply, asking if a  shore had been attained or if the language were dutch or swahili  i didn’t know. it is how you raised the ground, like raising a child  every word that comes out of my mouth torn i’m responsible to  the wind foul pieces here tries to turn me from tenderness, the way  they killed us in the center of the city, that night. the bodies  floated in the river while i looked for other souls and saw my face  water damaged a new texture and how can i see? potential  returning within its white petals and central whorl.    he couldn’t believe someone would hate and betray. i  told him, but he refused to believe it; then i left the room.  this lace has to be made. treason said the ghoul that  peculiar invention betrayal, how primal was that?  in hesiod after the light, after chaos and lover. said the armless  woman, said the one cut open, said the smallpoxed  the strewn children their bodies woven into the page  so i could find what they thought, even if babies only cry.  those are the bodies when i was no longer alive but uplifted  butterfly of lace with an empty length to bifurcate my symmetry.  no i don’t believe the lies of the live. i am a spot of light in  order to find out, hanging on because it wasn’t revealed in  death. i know what happened to me, she said; bleeding i  lay there unblessed. do i want a blessing now, or a god to  rebuild me? we have gone beyond god or new lives, or death, or  tribes. i am working on this lace light at present; i accept the  drop of sacrificial blood to propitiate me. one piece of you at a time  is all i need. i am letting you feed, i say, because i know this has  always been. you’ve been telling me for years  we needed you, if no one else did. we have this project to  change our silence into the beautiful city of a voice.  
NEW POEM
 which reminds me of another knock-on-wood memory. i was cycling with a male friend, through a small midwestern town. we came to a 4-way stop and stopped, chatting. as we started again, a rusty old pick-up truck, ignoring the stop sign, hurricaned past scant inches from our front wheels. my partner called, “hey, that was a 4-way stop!” the truck driver, stringy blond hair a long fringe under his brand-name beer cap, looked back and yelled, “you fucking niggers!” and sped off. my friend and i looked at each other and shook our heads. we remounted our bikes and headed out of town. we were pedaling through a clear blue afternoon between two fields of almost-ripened wheat bordered by cornflowers and queen anne’s lace when we heard an unmuffled motor, a honk-honking. we stopped, closed ranks, made fists. it was the same truck. it pulled over. a tall, very much in shape young white guy slid out: greasy jeans, homemade finger tattoos, probably a marine corps boot-camp footlockerful of martial arts techniques.  “what did you say back there!” he shouted. my friend said, “i said it was a 4-way stop. you went through it.” “and what did i say?” the white guy asked. “you said: ‘you fucking niggers.’” the afternoon froze.  “well,” said the white guy, shoving his hands into his pockets and pushing dirt around with the pointed toe of his boot, “i just want to say i’m sorry.” he climbed back into his truck and drove away.  
NEW POEM
 what do we do when we hate our bodies? a good coat helps. some know how to pull off a hat.  and there are paints, lighting, knives, needles, various kinds of resignation, the laugh in the mirror, the lie  of saying it doesn’t matter. there is also the company we keep: surgeons and dermatologists,  faith healers and instruction-givers, tailors of cashmere and skin who send their bills for holding  our shame-red hands, raw from the slipping rope, the same hands with which we tremble  ever so slightly, holding novels in bed, concentrating on the organization of pain and joy  we say is another mirror, a depth, a conjure in which we might meet someone who says touch me.

 when ocean-clouds over inland hills sweep storming in late autumn brown, and horror the sodden valley fills, and the spire falls crashing in the town, i muse upon my country’s ills— the tempest bursting from the waste of time on the world’s fairest hope linked with man’s foulest crime.  nature’s dark side is heeded now— (ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)— a child may read the moody brow of yon black mountain lone. with shouts the torrents down the gorges go, and storms are formed behind the storm we feel: the hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.

 that day in december i sat down by miss muffet of montgomery. i was myriad-weary. feets swole from sewing seams on a filthy fabric; tired-sore a pedalin’ the rusty singer;  dingy cotton thread jammed in the eye. all lifelong i’d slide through century-reams loathsome with tears. dreaming my own silk-self.  it was not like they all say. miss liberty muffet she didn’t jump at the sight of me. not exactly. they hauled me away—a thousand kicking legs pinned down.  the rest of me i tell you—a cloud. beautiful trouble on the dead december horizon. come to sit in judgment.  how many miles as the jim crow flies? over oceans and some. i rumbled. they couldn’t hold me down. long. no.  my feets were tired. my eyes were sore. my heart was raw from hemming dirty edges of miss l. muffet’s garment. i rode again.  a thousand bloody miles after the crow flies that day in december long remembered when i sat down beside miss muffet of montgomery. i said—like the joke say—what’s in the bowl, thief? i said—that’s your curse. i said—this my way. she slipped her frock, disembarked, settled in the suburbs, deaf, mute, lewd, and blind. the bowl she left behind. the empty bowl mine. the spoiled dress.  jim crow dies and ravens come with crumbs. they say—eat and be satisfied. i fast and pray and ride.

 there was no room for us to have feelings. under the queen, we were foiled, our faces blanked of wonder. a pitiful ordeal, our cheap toil. we hated her for stealing.  our crooked backs ached; our knees bled from kneeling, the whole sum of our treasures given up to fund her. there was no room for us to have feelings,  so we made our way quietly; we arranged our own dealings, checked what we clocked. each swallowed their thunder and railed within. nothing left out for stealing.  but pound for pound, we grew skinny, weary, reeling from the new rules she devised. we had to watch and mind her. there was no room for us to have feelings.  we were audited, then fined. we abided her schooling. then, all music stopped. all solitude filled, we couldn't ponder our losses. we tried to forget how much she was stealing.  our patron saints left us; the stars took to jeering, leering at our lessened state. we hardened at our blunder. there was no room to have any feelings. what of us? not a pittance. no worth there for stealing.

 you would extend the mind beyond the act, furious, bending, suffering in thin and unpoetic dicta; you have been forced by hypothesis to fiercer fact. as metal singing hard, with firmness racked, you formulate our passion; and behind in some harsh moment nowise of the mind lie the old meanings your advance has packed.  no man can hold existence in the head. i, too, have known the anguish of the right amid this net of mathematic dearth, and the brain throbbing like a ship at night: have faced with old unmitigated dread the hard familiar wrinkles of the earth.

 spring wafts up the smell of bus exhaust, of bread and fried potatoes, tips green on the branches, repeats old news: arrogance, ignorance, war. a cinder-block wall shared by two houses is new rubble. on one side was a kitchen sink and a cupboard, on the other was a bed, a bookshelf, three framed photographs.  glass is shattered across the photographs; two half-circles of hardened pocket bread sit on the cupboard. there provisionally was shelter, a plastic truck under the branches of a fig tree. a knife flashed in the kitchen, merely dicing garlic. engines of war move inexorably toward certain houses  while citizens sit safe in other houses reading the newspaper, whose photographs make sanitized excuses for the war. there are innumerable kinds of bread brought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen: the date, the latitude, tell which one was dropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches.  the uncontrolled and multifurcate branches of possibility infiltrate houses’ walls, windowframes, ceilings. where there was a tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph on a distant computer screen. elsewhere, a kitchen table’s setting gapes, where children bred to branch into new lives were culled for war.  who wore this starched smocked cotton dress? who wore this jersey blazoned for the local branch of the district soccer team? who left this black bread and this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses? whose father begged for mercy in the kitchen? whose memory will frame the photograph and use the memory for what it was  never meant for by this girl, that old man, who was caught on a ball field, near a window: war, exhorted through the grief a photograph revives. (or was the team a covert branch of a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen, a bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?) what did the old men pray for in their houses  of prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses between blackouts and blasts, when each word was flensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread, both hostage to the happenstance of war? sometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen. outside the window, black strokes on a graph of broken glass, birds line up on bare branches.  “this letter curves, this one spreads its branches like friends holding hands outside their houses.” was the lesson stopped by gunfire? was there panic, silence? does a torn photograph still gather children in the teacher’s kitchen? are they there meticulously learning war- time lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?

 the heavy, wet, guttural small-plane engine fights for air, and goes down in humid darkness about where the airport should be. i take a lot for granted, not pleased to be living under the phlegm- soaked, gaseous, foggy and irradiated heavens whose angels wear collars in propjets and live elsewhere in clean zones, but figuring the air is full of sorrows.  i don’t blame the quick use of the entire earth on the boozy pilot come down to get a dose of cobalt for his cancer. he’s got a little life left, if he doesn’t have to take all day to reach it. with the black patches inside him, and the scars and the streaks and the sick stomach,  his life is more and more like that of the lowliest child chimney sweep in the mind of the great insensible, william blake. william blake, the repeated one, blake, half mad, half remembered, who knew his anatomy, down to the little-observed muscle in the shoulder that lifts the wing.  the little london chimney sweeper reaches up and reaches down. in his back, every vertebra is separated from the long hours of stretching. with one deep, tired breath, the lungs go black.  by the holiday company crane, adding a level to the hospital, on the highest land in the county, heavy sits the pure-white air care helicopter, with its bulging eye. it has kept many going, a good buy, something.  now someone i know says blake in anger, angry for his brother in the factory and his sister on the ward, but tonight i have no more anger than the muscle that lifts my knee when i walk.  another pleads with the ocean that the words for suffering and trouble take place in a sound that will be all sounds and in the tidal roll of all our lives and every event, but i am silent by water,  and am less to such power than a failed lung.  and i think it is only a clever trick to know that one thing may be contained in another. hence, blake in the sweep, one in the ground in one in the air, myself in the clinic for runaway cells, now and later.

 a tribute the elephant's trunk uncurling from the lightning flashes in the clouds was marie antoinette, as usual trumpeting. the greedy suction was her tornado vacuuming across the golden kansas flatness.  meanwhile, the count was talking to the swan. the swan liked what he was saying and got right out of the pond. meanwhile, grown men in afghanistan. the count had fought in algeria. meanwhile, neon in tokyo.  madame la comtesse waved to us from the top step, waved to her count, their swan, their ornamental pond,et moi. we were a towering cornucopia of autumn happiness and gourmandise rotating counterclockwise, backwards toward the guillotine.  i kept a rainbow as a pet and grandly walked the rainbow on a leash. i exercised it evenings together with the cheetah, a thorstein veblen moment of conspicuous consumption: a dapper dauphin in a t-shirt that said fred parading with his pets decked out in t-shirts that said fred's.  i left my liver in the cher. i ate my heart out en berry. we drank and ate france between the wars, and every morning couldn't wait. it felt sunshiny in the shadow of the château.  and when the rainbow leapt from there to here, it landed twenty years away from the cher. the place it landed was the persian gulf. it landed twinkling stardust where i'm standing in my life with one-hump marie antoinette, my wife, who resembles that disarming camel yesterday.  in fact, the camel yesterday was smitten. she left the other camels to come over. you have a lovely liquid wraparound eye. she stood there looking at me sideways. they feed their racing camels caviar in qatar. the ruler of dubai has said that he will try to buy versailles.  a refrigerated ski slope, five stories high, lives improbably inside a downtown shopping mall in dubai. arab men, wearing sneakers under their robes, hold hands. faceless black veils stop shopping to watch through the glass. seeing the skiers emphasizes the desert, like hearing far-off thunder at a picnic.  both the word thunder and the word picnic are of course arabic. indeed, arabic was the language of french aristocrats before the terror, bad body odor perfumed. it is the language of the great robert frost poems, which have the suicide bomber's innocence walking safely past the checkpoint into the crowd.  they pay payola to al qaeda to stay away from doha. the emir was in his counting-house, counting out his oil and gas. another sunny sunni day in the uae! a candidate for president who wants to manumit our oil-dependent nation first has to get the message to every oily girl and boy  to just say no to up and down and in and out, labanotation of moaning oil rigs extracting oil joy. my fellow americans, i see a desert filled with derricks pumping up and down but never satisfied: obsessional hydraulics and jimi hendrix has hysterics. i smash my guitar to bits on stage and that's all, folks!  it isn't. i contemplate the end of the world. it isn't. i have my croissant and café and the trib and walk the rainbow around the block. the young north african hipsters in the bitter banlieues contemplate the end of the world.  i contemplate the end of the world but in my case it's not. there are still things to buy. i walk the rainbow in the dark. the world is the kiosk where i get my herald tribune. the world is my local café where my café au lait is quadroon.  i go to the strange little statue of pierre mendès-france in the jardin du luxembourg, in paris, france. i make a pilgrimage to it. my quaint political saint and i visit. the young north african hipsters in the bitter banlieues contemplate the end of the world, which isn't  the end of the world, though yes, quite true, in algeria and afghanistan jihad is developing a dirty nuclear bomb that smells like frangipani in flower to keep frangipani in power. ayatollah frangipani has returned from his long exile in france  to annihilate vice. i stomp the campfire out and saddle up my loyal mayflower— who is swifter than a life is brief under the stars! my prize four-wheel-drive with liquid wraparound eyes! we ski the roller coaster ocean's up and down dunes. we reach land at last and step on plymouth rock.

 "if you cut off my hands, i'll offer you my stumps." if you knock out my teeth, i'll still go down on you, conscientiously, vine along a trellis, and suck you with my gums. if you smash my toes, employing an ice crusher, one by one, i'll heal myself with such truancy that someday i'll run on my knees.  "if you cut off my hands, i'll offer you my stumps," and orchestrate a standing ovation with the memory of my hands representing each that are dying, each that are dead, each forgotten that we refuse to remember like the lost hands of stumps. so much misery in plain sight like tears streaming down a face; so much misery hidden like the eventuality of the anti-christ; and so much incognito like the accompanying instruments of a torch song: like the fire in the torch itself, like the torched interior of the song.  if you cut off my ears, i will listen with my eyes to the spitting death of cavalrymen as they're roasted over an open fire; to the smallest bones snap, dry as sun-seasoned kindling of the young and truant witch when she's pressed by a thousand stones; to the brave convulsions of the communist strapped in the electric chair, dying by degree...not unlike the commonfolk plucked from the village, arbitrarily, one last december night, stripped to the flesh and heaved high into the freezing air upon a whittled stave, tall and sharp, thrust deep into the asshole they die by degree, ever so slowly and often only (if not by freezing first, which, if merciful, god deems) when the wooden point finally pierces the brain, brain-dead already from the mauve anticipation and ear-splitting prerequisite of pain.  if you cut out my tongue, i will write you a letter, a love letter lovelorn for that taste of your tongue. if you fuck me hard i can never make love again, i'll plant hyacinth bulbs in an effort to replace my abolished fecundity. i will turn eternally on my side and pull down my pants and listen to your masturbate while fantasizing about my ass. i'll admire the willow out the window when i hear you come and allow as if in tribute to the times i used to participate, a vague expression of pleasure, albeit contrived to wash across my face the way my desire for you, real as a willow, once had done.

 it is true, that even in the best-run state such things will happen; it is true, what’s done is done. the law, whereby we hate our hatred, sees no fire in the flue but by the smoke, and not for thought alone it punishes, but for the thing that’s done.  and yet there is the horror of the fact, though we knew not the man. to die in jail, to be beaten to death, to know the act of personal fury before the eyes can fail and the man die against the cold last wall of the lonely world—and neither is that all:  there is the terror too of each man’s thought, that knows not, but must quietly suspect his neighbor, friend, or self of being taught to take an attitude merely correct; being frightened of his own cold image in the glass of government, and his own sin,  frightened lest senate house and prison wall be quarried of one stone, lest righteous and high look faintly smiling down and seem to call a crime the welcome chance of liberty, and any man an outlaw who aggrieves the patriotism of a pair of thieves.

 of course you have faced the dilemma: it is announced, they all smirk and rise. if they are ultra, they remove their hats and look ecstatic; then they look at you. what shall you do?noblesse oblige; you cannot be boorish, or ungracious; and too, after all it is your country and you do love its ideals if not all of its realities. now, then, i have thought of a way out: arise, gracefully remove your hat, and tilt your head. then sing as follows, powerfully and with deep unction. they’ll hardly note the little changes and their feelings and your conscience will thus be saved:  my country tis of thee, late land of slavery, of thee i sing. land where my father’s pride slept where my mother died, from every mountain side let freedom ring!  my native country thee land of the slave set free, thy fame i love. i love thy rocks and rills and o’er thy hate which chills, my heart with purpose thrills, to rise above.  let laments swell the breeze and wring from all the trees sweet freedom’s song. let laggard tongues awake, let all who hear partake, let southern silence quake, the sound prolong.  our fathers’ god to thee author of liberty, to thee we sing soon may our land be bright, with freedom’s happy light protect us by thy might, great god our king.

 ferrara that’s my last duchess painted on the wall, looking as if she were alive. i call that piece a wonder, now; fra pandolf’s hands worked busily a day, and there she stands. will’t please you sit and look at her? i said “fra pandolf” by design, for never read strangers like you that pictured countenance, the depth and passion of its earnest glance, but to myself they turned (since none puts by the curtain i have drawn for you, but i) and seemed as they would ask me, if they durst, how such a glance came there; so, not the first are you to turn and ask thus. sir, ’twas not her husband’s presence only, called that spot of joy into the duchess’ cheek; perhaps fra pandolf chanced to say, “her mantle laps over my lady’s wrist too much,” or “paint must never hope to reproduce the faint half-flush that dies along her throat.” such stuff was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough for calling up that spot of joy. she had a heart—how shall i say?— too soon made glad, too easily impressed; she liked whate’er she looked on, and her looks went everywhere. sir, ’twas all one! my favour at her breast, the dropping of the daylight in the west, the bough of cherries some officious fool broke in the orchard for her, the white mule she rode with round the terrace—all and each would draw from her alike the approving speech, or blush, at least. she thanked men—good! but thanked somehow—i know not how—as if she ranked my gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name with anybody’s gift. who’d stoop to blame this sort of trifling? even had you skill in speech—which i have not—to make your will quite clear to such an one, and say, “just this or that in you disgusts me; here you miss, or there exceed the mark”—and if she let herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse— e’en then would be some stooping; and i choose never to stoop. oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt, whene’er i passed her; but who passed without much the same smile? this grew; i gave commands; then all smiles stopped together. there she stands as if alive. will’t please you rise? we’ll meet the company below, then. i repeat, the count your master’s known munificence is ample warrant that no just pretense of mine for dowry will be disallowed; though his fair daughter’s self, as i avowed at starting, is my object. nay, we’ll go together down, sir. notice neptune, though, taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity, which claus of innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

 reason looks for where i woke and was awake, in the two, then room fitting the wall, withdrawn, i arranges it had my desk and thus my corner. from there while waiting, waltz. the soles of our boots wear thin, but the soles of our feet grow thick. the difference between “he presented his argument” and “they had an argument.”   i still respond to the academic year, the sound of the school bell, the hot wednesday morn- ing after labor day. must the physiologist stand apart from the philosopher. we are not forgetting the patience of the mad, their love of detail. the sudden brief early morning breeze, the first indication of a day‘s palpability, stays high in the trees, while flashing silver and green the leaves flutter, a bird sweeps from one branch to another, the indistinct shadows lift off the crumpled weeds, smoke rises from the gravel quarry——all this is metonymy. the “argument”   is the plot, proved by the book. going forward and coming back later. even posterity, alas, will know sears. as for we who “love to be astonished,” there are fences keeping cyclones. might be covered, on the ground, by no distance. she spread her fingers as she spoke, talking of artifice, which extends beauty beyond nature. perhaps it is only a coincidence. for, as neitzsche put it, “if a man has character, he will have the same experience over and over again.” in the morning at eight i sense the first threat of monotony. give a penny with a knife. candor is the high pitch of scrutiny. i was tired of ideas, or, rather, the activity of ideas, a kind of exercise, had first invigorated me and then made me sleepy, so that i felt just as one does after a long, early morning walk, returning unable to decide whether to drink more coffee or go back to sleep. the uncommon run of keeping oneself to oneself. the piggy-back plant is o.k. tell anyone who telephones that i’m not home. i liked doing that, had made rooms for dolls on trucks that way, looking in on them through windows. it was a pretense of keeping our distance from anything that ap- peared pretentious. a sorry mess, but well-framed. as if a contorted checkerboard formed the portrait of a handsome woman in a hat of several ochres and umbers. the dog circles more than a moth before resting. let the traffic pass. they were on vacation and therefore bored. someone wanted to go away from everywhere forever but jumped into the bay. we were warned such accidents happen while mothers talk on phones. a doodled gnarled tree. milk belongs to the mythology of cats but it makes them sick. ours was a stray with ringworm. one night each year on boston’s beacon hill the curtains remained undrawn and the public was invited to peek in. i didn’t wear my dark glasses because i didn’t want a raccoon tan. yet this needs shading in. it seemed that i didn’t, after all, want a birthday empty of sentimentality. it’s on the compulsive buyer’s rack up front. the real adversary of my determination was determinism, regulating and limiting the range and degree of difference between things of one day and things of the next. i got it from darwin, freud, and marx. not fragments but metonymy. duration. language makes tracks.

 that lucia broke the machine twice in one week was evidence enough. he also offered this—she’s no longer automatic, her stitches are crooked and once another seamstress found lucia’s “lost” sewing patterns in the trash. the security guard half listened as lucia gathered her things. then the manager turned directly to her—what is it with you? we give you work, put money in your pocket. she put on her best disappointed face as they escorted her past rows of itchy throats, bowed heads, the refrain of needle through fabric.      every day elena counts pig. a pageant of molded plastic rolling down the conveyor belt. the task: grab miss piggy, pull gown over snout, fasten two tiny buttons, grab another. with each doll elena’s hands grow stiffer. her feet grow heavy as the concrete below. dolls spit at her, or maybe this is imagined, but the ache in her legs might be real. the supervisor brushes against her back when he patrols the floor. after standing for hours, the room begins to blur. her mouth opens like an empty wallet as naked dolls march on.     what will settle in, what will rise from the lungs of girls who still burn weeks after detox treatment at a local clinic. speak of headaches, blurred vision, diarrhea. how they suck air thick with sulfuric acid. acetone working past unfiltered exhaust systems and through their livers. most return to work despite doctors’ orders. back inside, the tin roof and their steady perspiration remind them they’re still alive—together one breathing, burning machine.      like celia’s pockets, there’s nothing but lint here. lint &amp; dead machines. the sound of layoffs &amp; profit margins. yesterday this department droned an unsynchronized rhythm of coughing girls tethered to well-lubed motors. row after row of pre-asthmatic lungs. black hair buried under perpetual white. the decision was made across the border, he tells them. nothing i can do about it. sometimes celia would imagine the whole place caught inside a tiny globe. something she could pick up. shake.      a perpetual conveyor, he patrols her mouth. the sound of unfiltered white. breathing margins. the task: grab elena’s hands. pull. fasten. he also offered crooked patterns. put money in her hair. that lucia broke. was evidence enough? molded vision as a refrain. an empty wallet will rise. speak. how they exhaust systems. despite the blurred other, the ache might be real. something she could pick up. across the border, nothing i can imagine.

 country people rise early as their distant lights testify. they don’t hold water in common. each house has a personal source, like a bank account, a stone vault. some share eggs, some share expertise, and some won’t even wave. a walk for the mail elevates the heart rate. last november i saw a woman down the road walk out to her mailbox dressed in blaze orange cap to boot, a cautious soul. bullets can’t read her no trespassing sign. strange to think they’re in the air like lead bees with a fatal sting. our neighbor across the road sits in his kitchen with his rifle handy and the window open. you never know when. once he shot a trophy with his barrel resting on the sill. he’s in his seventies, born here, joined the navy, came back. hard work never hurt a man until suddenly he was another broken tool. his silhouette against the dawn droops as though drought-stricken, each step deliberate, down the driveway to his black mailbox, prying it open. checking a trap.

 why not a crocus from this bulb? why not the purple of bees’ lust so that, in honey, she might taste something good? under skin, purple is a private taste, closer to the blood of her tongue, closer to the blood she chokes on when she’s gasping, to the clot behind her blackened eye. the heated force that slammed her shin, that pushed bone from the bone, that arched her but did not approach caress, is another kind of lust. spring: a madness of grappling. isn’t that what she sees outside every window? and inside? nothing unique going on.

 how do you recognize a lovely place? the rotten anthropology of superheroes hovers above the conference table, exhausted on the idea of dazzling people. a plugged organization of the moon like a turnpike undecorated by barely legal children — true stories end in the moody doctor city but i always say the wrong thing. away from las vegas i spend too much time at the whale facility. i’m bored with awakening into historical x-rays of the no moment. (what showmanship!) who does wear a cape underwater? now egypt is miniaturized and it may never rain again. hurling bodies and collapsing lungs used to be honestly scripted activities — the stillness in the dream of important history. from now on your stillness will be happening. in the actual dream remember how the children were modified, the sputtering, russel crotty language? friendly calliope is no longer remedial in the crisply american landscape. even snowy vermont grows opaque, a diminished suggestion in the desert mirror. i feel as if i’m speaking to a dear friend but i’m saying the wrong things.i don’t like cockfights or you’d rather be my daughter, deeply, authentically factualizing our especially southern roots.

 tell me a story, father please, and then i sat upon his knees. then answer’d he,—“what speech make known, or tell the words of native tone, of how my indian fathers dwelt, and, of sore oppression felt; and how they mourned a land serene, it was an ever mournful theme.”  yes, i replied,—i like to hear, and bring my father’s spirit near; of every pain they did forego, oh, please to tell me all you know. in history often i do read, of pain which none but they did heed.  he thus began. “we were a happy race, when we no tongue but ours did trace, we were in ever peace, we sold, we did release— our brethren, far remote, and far unknown, and spake to them in silent, tender tone. we all were then as in one band, we join’d and took each others hand; our dress was suited to the clime, our food was such as roam’d that time, our houses were of sticks compos’d; no matter,—for they us enclos’d.  but then discover’d was this land indeed by european men; who then had need of this far country. columbus came afar, and thus before we could say ah! what meaneth this?—we fell in cruel hands.  though some were kind, yet others then held bands of cruel oppression. then too, foretold our chief,— beggars you will become—is my belief. we sold, then some bought lands, we altogether moved in foreign hands.  wars ensued. they knew the handling of firearms. mothers spoke,—no fear this breast alarms, they will not cruelly us oppress, or thus our lands possess. alas! it was a cruel day; we were crush’d: into the dark, dark woods we rush’d to seek a refuge.  my daughter, we are now diminish’d, unknown, unfelt! alas! no tender tone to cheer us when the hunt is done; fathers sleep,—we’re silent every one.  oh! silent the horror, and fierce the fight, when my brothers were shrouded in night; strangers did us invade—strangers destroy’d the fields, which were by us enjoy’d.  our country is cultur’d, and looks all sublime, our fathers are sleeping who lived in the time that i tell. oh! could i tell them my grief in its flow, that in roaming, we find no relief.  i love my country, and shall, until death shall cease my breath.  now daughter dear i’ve done, seal this upon thy memory; until the morrow’s sun shall sink, to rise no more; and if my years should score, remember this, though i tell no more.”

 i’m sitting at nathan’s, reading a biography of darwin who, right now, is dissecting a barnacle  “no bigger than a pinhead (and with two penises)”: he’ll work like this on barnacles, his wrists supported  by rigged-up blocks of workshop wood, for eight years. nathan is reading too, in the worn-down banged-up “daddy chair”:  those philosophical poems of william bronk’s. what’s most delightful is that tristan, eleven, and aidan, ten,  are reading, each of them enmazed in a fantasy novel that squeezes them by the attention-bone behind the eyes  in its thimble pool of pineal juice and drizzled endorphins. tristan cared enough to cry when he finished his previous book  and its battle of shadow and radiance was over. each of us: his individual book; and yet  the silence is communal. this is a natural state at nathan’s. holly, however, is reading the sunday paper  and so serves, without saying a word, to remind us how natural it was for raeshawn nelson, seven,  to fall while running and burn out his eye on the disregarded meth pipe, or for anna rietta, nine,  to have come home from school and excitedly been the **!star!**, each day, of the homemade porn her parents  peddled as “young fun” over the internet. this was what they knew, and all they knew, and so they entered it  as comfortably as tristan does his opened world of sorcerors and valiant knights and fancy-talking beasts, since use  x frequency = familiarity. that’s the strict, imperious math of everybody’s insular subuniverse. sherena asked me what  this thing “vermouth” was (she pronounced it “mouth”) and ordered quiche as if it were the brother of “touché”; but then  she needed to explain to me why c-c was the “bottom bitch” and what a “t-girl” is and how to put down money  on ice’s book at “the county,” by which she meant jail. and those years when darwin parsed  the slimy fiber of his barnacles (discovering the species where “the female has no anus” and the one with “tiny parasitic  males [that were] embedded in one female’s flesh like blackheads”), “squinty . . . laborious,” were among the final decades of hundreds of years  when a woman in china would suffer ritual foot binding, at five, the bandages limiting growth until the toes  were bent and curled (the toenails growing into the balls of the feet) and the arches broken. this resulted in the desirable  “shrunken plums” and “three-inch golden lilies” sought by marriage brokers. traditionally, a prospective mother-in-law  would check below the hem, and reject any feet over four inches long. entire generations of women could only  mince and hobble. and this was natural, this was the air and the light and “the-way-of-things-forever” that  you woke up to every day . . . as natural as the implicit laws in aidan’s book, by which a bear converses  with a girl in growly mutual-speak, and a boy of sturdy heart and his wingéd horse ascend  their sky with the unremarkable grace of birds in ours. that’s ordinary newtonian physics there, and aidan  subjects himself to the rules of flying horsemanship, and the code of those of innocent spirit  about to war with wyverns and the wormfolk, and the governing instructions of gods with the heads  of wide-eyed animals . . . and even now, sherena texts my phone to say that weather good and shine  got bullet in lung from police

 not like the brazen giant of greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land; here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, and her name mother of exiles. from her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she with silent lips. “give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, i lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

 have but one god: thy knees were sore if bent in prayer to three or four.  adore no images save those the coinage of thy country shows.  take not the name in vain. direct thy swearing unto some effect.  thy hand from sunday work be held— work not at all unless compelled.  honor thy parents, and perchance their wills thy fortunes may advance.  kill not—death liberates thy foe from persecution’s constant woe.  kiss not thy neighbor’s wife. of course there’s no objection to divorce.  to steal were folly, for ’tis plain in cheating there is greater gain.  bear not false witness. shake your head and say that you have “heard it said.”  who stays to covet ne’er will catch an opportunity to snatch.

 pardon us for uttering a handful of words in any language, so cut loose are we from homes, and from his name that is still nameless, blessed be he. we raised a prayer house—  that is, we broke new wood for one, but some tough burned it, snarling: “carve only stones for the dead.” damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember. but tall ships anchor here, and at low tide,  people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea, just as we’d searched for land. “pray if you must,” my father said, “and when prayer fails, a story, if it is all you have, will do.” months past,  we left recife’s forced-worship laws in the year of their lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new world, old-country amsterdam. leagues seaward, spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew,  and all that was left of us (friends wheezed their last while they ragged us on) rose up on deck and tossed our bags in the sea. we watched the wake turn silver: kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls,  a candelabrum for the promised altar, carved pointers. books’ pages curled and sank, prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward. just as we stared, again we heard swords clank—  a french ship, the ste. catherine(her prow had shone gold on a gray horizon), came to our port side and rescued us. in that commotion on deck, we crouched below—not out of fear,  i swear, but stunned by luminous words that echoed oddly—beautifully—like lightning flickering through palls of thickset clouds. a jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding:  “where are you bound?” “amsterdam. old country.” “where?” “amsterdam.” “antilles?” “no, amsterdam.” “yes, yes. nieuw am sterdam. i’ll see you get there safely.” he meant well, bless him.  ste. catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger than a meadow, fanned out at its sides: manhattan island. our new master, stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases,wheffs, guzzads,  that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully, when we came on a sabbath, more than twenty men, women, a baby born at sea. still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise,  then disappeared among lank citizens with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood on water that we trust and dread, and listen to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.

 tossing off expletives into the sea of cab lights, i lounge ever more than i work. i wear my silk pants to the middle-of-america themed bar as if white-collar were this halloween's hottest new costume. it sinks like a stone, this attention to the lives of others. i think i have evolved to respect my social obligations, only complaining to the cell phone's warm illicit glow. i feel drunk on the whole leafy season when you hear me, working ever to avoid work. sentiment forbidden by custom, industrialization forbidden by nothing. down the block they have begun restoring the mid-century antique dresser, men shuffling back and forth with gold polish and sand. it's insane that i care to ask towards its progress. we repeat a process of hoping our bodies to the future though for now mine eats cucumbers in bed. i had a dream about a crystal blue pool. i felt stupid when i saw the ocean.

 i. i like to travel to l.a. by myself my trips to the crowded smoggy polluted by brown indigenous and immigrant haze are healing. i travel from one pollution to another. being urban i return to where i came from my mother survives in l.a. now for over forty years.  i drive to l.a. in the darkness of the day on the road before chp one with the dark driving my black truck invisible on my journey home.  the dark roads take me back to my childhood riding in the camper of daddy’s truck headed home. my brother, sister and i would be put to sleep in the camper and sometime in the darkness of the day daddy would clime into the cab with mom carrying a thermos full of coffee and some pendleton blankets and they would pray before daddy started the truck for journey mercies.  often i’d rise from my lullaby sleep and stare into the darkness of the road the long darkness empty of cars glowy from daddy’s headlights and lonesome from hank williams’ deep and twangy voice singing of cold nights and cheatin’ hearts.  about an hour from flagstaff the sun would greet us and the harsh light would break the darkness and we’d be hungry from travel and for being almost home.  ii. i know the darkness of the roads endless into the glowy path before me lit by the moon high above and the heat rising from my truck’s engine. the humming from tires whisper mile after mile endless alongside roadside of fields shadowy from glow.  i know the darkness of the roads it swims through my veins dark like my skin and silenced like a battered wife. i know the darkness of the roads it floods my liver pollutes my breath yet i still witness the white dawning.

 you're dreaming of cratoids, armpullers, the blownose dragon. who knows what anna brichtova dreamed about, the girl who comes looking for us tonight with her mosaic of colored paper: her house with its red roof, some trees on a green lawn, the sky—outside, the concentration camp. this is the real gift i brought back from prague without telling you. it was with me on the train the morning i thought i was living in hell: stuttgart, or south of there, amid a drone of people working—they don't know at what or for whom, but they're working, pressing keys, sending messages to unknown persons through the air. nothing but eyes and fingers, nothing but one day after the next, interminable passage of a time that doesn't vary, that belongs forever to others, to something outside themselves, and the fear, the hatred of one pariah for another, this brawl of lost souls, of new slaves. the great drinker of beer, the woman staring into space, mazinger z: these were my traveling companions.  who knows what anna brichtova dreamed about, or what you're dreaming now, or how you children see the world. will you find, among your games, the game that saves us? it's what we all are hoping as we watch you sleep.

 childhood remembrances are always a drag if you’re black you always remember things like living in woodlawn with no inside toilet and if you become famous or something they never talk about how happy you were to have your mother all to yourself and how good the water felt when you got your bath from one of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in and somehow when you talk about home it never gets across how much you understood their feelings as the whole family attended meetings about hollydale and even though you remember your biographers never understand your father’s pain as he sells his stock and another dream goes and though you’re poor it isn’t poverty that concerns you and though they fought a lot it isn’t your father’s drinking that makes any difference but only that everybody is together and you and your sister have happy birthdays and very good christmases and i really hope no white person ever has cause to write about me because they never understand black love is black wealth and they’ll probably talk about my hard childhood and never understand that all the while i was quite happy

 as soon as i step into the tunnel that will take me under the river i need to cross to get to the city my brain shuts down.  no signal gets through and the question remains how do i know?  with a brain well emptied, and a head a vacuum of nothing, everything i’ve ever known goes quietly absent.  as still and as quiet as a house abandoned or a mouth wide open in a painting.  as soon as i step out of the tunnel scientists squabble about when we should abandon the earth for some other place.  i duck straight back into the tunnel in order to disrupt the signal.  in the tunnel's shelter there is nothing in my head, it's empty enough for the origins of the universe to begin.  a frightening thing interrupted by my backing back out of the tunnel just in time.  in the light of day what's on my mind turns out to be your lifespan. next to the tunnel is the only safe place to be.  it is the only place where it's certain i’ll not all day not need to be crying and weeping to go on.  which draws me directly back into the tunnel to interrupt the signal. it takes a little while for my mind to stop trembling.

 i. tonight, i look, thunderstruck at the gold head of my grandchild. almost asleep, he buries his feet between my thighs; his little straw eyes close in the near dark. i smell the warmth of his raw slightly foul breath, the new death waiting to rot inside him. our breaths equalize our heartbeats; every muscle of the chest uncoils, the arm bones loosen in the nest of nerves. i think of the peace of walking through the house, pointing to the name of this, the name of that, an educator of a new man.  mother. grandmother. wise snake-woman who will show the way; spider-woman whose black tentacles hold him precious. or will tear off his head, her teeth over the little husband, the small fist clotted in trust at her breast.  this morning, looking at the face of his father, i remembered how, an infant, his face was too dark, nose too broad, mouth too wide. i did not look in that mirror and see the face that could save me from my own darkness. did he, looking in my eye, see what i turned from: my own dark grandmother bending over gladioli in the field, her shaking black hand defenseless at the shining cock of flower?  i wanted that face to die, to be reborn in the face of a white child.  i wanted the soul to stay the same, for i loved to death, to damnation and god-death, the soul that broke out of me. i crowed: my son! my beautiful! but when i peeked in the basket, i saw the face of a black man.  did i bend over his nose and straighten it with my fingers like a vine growing the wrong way? did he feel my hand in malice?  generations we prayed and fucked for this light child, the shining god of the second coming; we bow down in shame and carry the children of the past in our wallets, begging forgiveness.  ii. a picture in a book, a lynching. the bland faces of men who watch a christ go up in flames, smiling, as if he were a hooked fish, a felled antelope, some wild thing tied to boards and burned. his charring body gives off light—a halo burns out of him. his face scorched featureless; the hair matted to the scalp like feathers. one man stands with his hand on his hip, another with his arm slung over the shoulder of a friend, as if this moment were large enough to hold affection.  iii. how can we wake from a dream we are born into, that shines around us, the terrible bright air?  having awakened, having seen our own bloody hands, how can we ask forgiveness, bring before our children the real monster of their nightmares?  the worst is true. everything you did not want to know.

 in the valley of the pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands rise the blue franconian mountains, nuremberg, the ancient, stands.  quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song, memories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them throng:  memories of the middle ages, when the emperors, rough and bold, had their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old;  and thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted, in their uncouth rhyme, that their great imperial city stretched its hand through every clime.  in the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron band, stands the mighty linden planted by queen cunigunde's hand;  on the square the oriel window, where in old heroic days sat the poet melchior singing kaiser maximilian's praise.  everywhere i see around me rise the wondrous world of art: fountains wrought with richest sculpture standing in the common mart;  and above cathedral doorways saints and bishops carved in stone, by a former age commissioned as apostles to our own.  in the church of sainted sebald sleeps enshrined his holy dust, and in bronze the twelve apostles guard from age to age their trust;  in the church of sainted lawrence stands a pix of sculpture rare, like the foamy sheaf of fountains, rising through the painted air.  here, when art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart, lived and labored albrecht dürer, the evangelist of art;  hence in silence and in sorrow, toiling still with busy hand, like an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the better land.  emigravit is the inscription on the tomb-stone where he lies; dead he is not, but departed, — for the artist never dies.  fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair, that he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!  through these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and dismal lanes, walked of yore the mastersingers, chanting rude poetic strains.  from remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly guild, building nests in fame's great temple, as in spouts the swallows build.  as the weaver plied the shuttle, wove he too the mystic rhyme, and the smith his iron measures hammered to the anvil's chime;  thanking god, whose boundless wisdom makes the flowers of poesy bloom in the forge's dust and cinders, in the tissues of the loom.  here hans sachs, the cobbler-poet, laureate of the gentle craft, wisest of the twelve wise masters, in huge folios sang and laughed.  but his house is now an ale-house, with a nicely sanded floor, and a garland in the window, and his face above the door;  painted by some humble artist, as in adam puschman's song, as the old man gray and dove-like, with his great beard white and long.  and at night the swart mechanic comes to drown his cark and care, quaffing ale from pewter tankards, in the master's antique chair.  vanished is the ancient splendor, and before my dreamy eye wave these mingled shapes and figures, like a faded tapestry.  not thy councils, not thy kaisers, win for thee the world's regard; but thy painter, albrecht dürer, and hans sachs thy cobbler bard.  thus, o nuremberg, a wanderer from a region far away, as he paced thy streets and court-yards, sang in thought his careless lay:  gathering from the pavement's crevice, as a floweret of the soil, the nobility of labor, — the long pedigree of toil.

 people in the middle ages didn't think they were living between two more important and enlightened eras; nor did they see themselves as the players in act three of a tragedy in five acts. it was not always late winter in the middle ages. people in the middle ages were not all middle-aged though it is enjoyable on occasion to assume that they were. the sun was as bright in the dark ages as it is now—maybe a fraction brighter, in fact.  think of the middle ages and what do you see: gloomy cathedrals, students dressed like monks in the rain, or a band of drunken pilgrims telling obscene jokes, or heroes embarking for the nearest wilderness come april? your answer will reveal yourself to yourself but you may not know it—may choose to hide in hazy visions of a serene and indescribable paradise. and paradise, as we all know, may be paradise when we’re dead, but is boredom on earth, alas.  we never think of ennui in relation to the middle ages. should we? did thomas aquinas never get bored cooking up elaborate refutations of diminutive heresies? no, and you shouldn’t either. nor did the clerks of oxford tire of the sin against the holy ghost, trying to figure out what it was.  on chill september mornings when i smoked too much the night before and i drank too much the night before and a sinister cough rises up from the depths of the belly of my being, i like to imagine living in provence or even in rheims during the middle ages.

 a b h o r r e n c e s 4 july, 1986 america is inconceivable without drugs and always has been. one of the first acts was to dump the tea. the drug that furnished the mansions of virginia was tobacco, a drug now in much disrepute. sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for and they dealt it by the bale altho it was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire— people were so simple in those days. the civil war saw the isolation of morphine making amputation a pleasure and making the block of wood between the teeth, which was no drug, obsolete. morphinism was soon widespread among doctors and patients. at this date interns, the reports tell us, are among the premier drug ab/users of said moralistic nation. “rock” stars (who notoriously “have” doctors) consume drugs by the metric ton even as they urge teenagers to say no. the undercurrent of american history has been the running aches and pains of the worn path to the door of the apothecary to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs by the gallon. it has been all prone all seeking florida, ponce de león was just the beginning of a statistical curve whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo. his eager search for youth has become our frantic tilt with death and boredom, in fact we are farming death in florida with far greater profit than we are farming food in iowa—elixirs are as multiform as the life-style frauds we implore, a cultural patchwork fit for a fool in the only country in the world with a shop called the drug store.

 pretty soon the negroes were looking to get paid. my partner, big trend, wiped his ox neck and said  he wasn't going to wait too much longer. you know that look your daddy gets before he whups you?  that's how big trend looked. there was a pink scar meddling his forehead. most people assumed a bear  like him couldn't read anything but a dollar, but i'd watched him tour the used bookstore in town and seen him napping so i knew he held more  than power in those hands. they could tear a bible in two. sometimes on the walk home i'd hear  him reciting poems. but come friday, he was the one the fellas asked to speak to the boss. he'd go alone,  usually, and left behind, we imagined the boss buckled into trend's shadow because our money always followed.

 where dost thou careless lie, buried in ease and sloth? knowledge that sleeps doth die; and this security, it is the common moth that eats on wits and arts, and oft destroys them both.  are all th' aonian springs dried up? lies thespia waste? doth clarius' harp want strings, that not a nymph now sings? or droop they as disgrac'd, to see their seats and bowers by chatt'ring pies defac'd?  if hence thy silence be, as 'tis too just a cause, let this thought quicken thee: minds that are great and free should not on fortune pause; 'tis crown enough to virtue still, her own applause.  what though the greedy fry be taken with false baites of worded balladry, and think it poesy? they die with their conceits, and only piteous scorn upon their folly waits.  then take in hand thy lyre, strike in thy proper strain, with japhet's line aspire sol's chariot for new fire, to give the world again; who aided him will thee, the issue of jove's brain.  and since our dainty age cannot endure reproof, make not thyself a page to that strumpet, the stage, but sing high and aloof, safe from the wolf's black jaw and the dull ass's hoof.

 here the subject thinks “there could be flowers” or “the water was a bit disturbed when the ring fell in.” all that, painted from said things, pleases it. that explains all things except for ovid’s exile which we will probably never understand. that adds to our sense of fragility, confirms the order in which we read. you still have the right to bear arms, “thing and joy,” the anxious doubt that was once written about.  there are several versions of the story where she is transformed into a swallow, flies around a pillar.  and do you find the rhyme? it originally meant spoken, the sentence, but spoken. flight, interchangeable with fate. as for myself, i can’t begin to approach the woods with it. the words of its condition.

 july 1965 as the sheriff remarked: i had no business being there. he was right, but for the wrong reasons. among that odd crew of volunteers from the north, i was by far the most inept and least effective. i couldn’t have inspired or assisted a woodchuck to vote. in fact, when the sheriff’s buddies nabbed me on the highway east of selma, i’d just been released from ten days of jail in mississippi. i was fed up and terrified; i was actually fleeing north and glad to go.  -  in jackson, they’d been ready for the demonstration. after the peaceful arrests, after the news cameras recorded us being quietly ushered onto trucks, the doors were closed and we headed for the county fairgrounds. once we passed its gates, it was a different story: the truck doors opened on a crowd of state troopers waiting to greet us with their nightsticks out. smiles beneath mirrored sunglasses and blue riot helmets; smiles above badges taped so numbers didn’t show. for the next twenty minutes, they clubbed us, and it kept up at intervals, more or less at random, all that afternoon and into the evening. next morning we woke to new guards who did not need to conceal their names or faces. a little later, the fbi arrived to ask if anyone had specific complaints about how they’d been treated and by whom. but late that first night, as we sat bolt upright in rows on the concrete floor of the cattle barn waiting for mattresses to arrive, one last precise event: a guard stopped in front of the ten-year-old black kid next to me. he pulled a freedom now pin from the kid’s shirt, made him put it in his mouth, then ordered him to swallow.  -  that stakeout at dusk on route 80 east of selma was intended for someone else, some imaginary organizer rumored to be headed toward their dismal, godforsaken town. why did they stop me? the new york plates, perhaps, and that little bit of stupidity: the straw hat i wore, a souvenir of mississippi. siren-wail from an unmarked car behind me—why should i think they were cops? i hesitated, then pulled to the shoulder. the two who jumped out waved pistols, but wore no uniforms or badges. by then, my doors were locked, my windows rolled. absurd sound of a pistol barrel rapping the glass three inches from my face: “get out, you son of a bitch, or we’ll blow your head off.” when they found pamphlets on the backseat they were sure they’d got the right guy. the fat one started poking my stomach with his gun, saying, “boy, we’re gonna dump you in the swamp.”  -  it was a long ride through the dark, a ride full of believable threats, before they arrived at that hamlet with its cinderblock jail. he was very glad to see it, that adolescent i was twenty years ago. for eight days he cowered in his solitary cell, stinking of dirt and fear. he’s cowering there still, waiting for me to come back and release him by turning his terror into art. but consciously or not, he made his choice and he’s caught in history. and if i reach back now, it’s only to hug him and tell him to be brave, to remember that black kid who sat beside him in the mississippi darkness. and to remember that silence shared by guards and prisoners alike as they watched in disbelief the darkness deepening around the small shape in his mouth, the taste of metal, the feel of the pin against his tongue. it’s too dark for it to matter what’s printed on the pin; it’s too dark for anything but the brute fact that someone wants him to choke to death on its hard shape. and still he refuses to swallow.

 october 18, 1914 i dreamt that people from the land of chimes arrived one autumn morning with their bells, to hoist them on the towers and citadels of my own country, that the musical rhymes  rung by them into space at meted times amid the market's daily stir and stress, and the night's empty star-lit silentness, might solace souls of this and kindred climes.  then i awoke; and lo, before me stood the visioned ones, but pale and full of fear; from bruges they came, and antwerp, and ostend,  no carillons in their train. foes of mad mood had shattered these to shards amid the gear of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end.

 on the metro, i have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me; she’s reading, her foot propped on the seat in front of her, and barely looks up as she pulls them to her. i sit, take out my own book—cioran, the temptation to exist—and notice her glancing up from hers to take in the title of mine, and then, as gombrowicz puts it, she “affirms herself physically,” that is, becomes present in a way she hadn’t been before: though she hasn’t moved, she’s allowed herself to come more sharply into focus, be more accessible to my sensual perception, so i can’t help but remark her strong figure and very tan skin—(how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer.) she leans back now, and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesn’t pull it away; she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite: the fine hairs on both our forearms, sensitive, alive, achingly alive, bring news of someone touched, someone sensed, and thus acknowledged, known.  i understand that in no way is she offering more than this, and in truth i have no desire for more, but it’s still enough for me to be taken by a surge, first of warmth then of something like its opposite: a memory—a girl i’d mooned for from afar, across the table from me in the library in school now, our feet i thought touching, touching even again, and then, with all i craved that touch to mean, my having to realize it wasn’t her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed, but a table leg. the young woman today removes her arm now, stands, swaying against the lurch of the slowing train, and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again, asserts her bodily being again, (gombrowicz again), then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends, not once looking back, (to my relief not looking back), and i allow myself the thought that though i must be to her again as senseless as that table of my youth, as wooden, as unfeeling, perhaps there was a moment i was not.

 she is girl. she is gravel. she is grabbed. she is grabbed like handfuls of gravel. gravel grated by water. her village is full of gravel fields. it is 1950. she is girl. she is grabbed. she is not my grandmother, though my grandmother is girl. my grandmother’s father closes the gates. against american soldiers, though they jump over stone walls. to a girl who is not my grandmother. the girl is gravel grabbed. her language is gravel because it means nothing. hands full of girl. fields full of gravel. korea is gravel and graves. girl is girl and she will never be a grandmother. she will be girl, girl is gravel and history will skip her like stone over water. oh girl, oh glory. girl.

 when we first moved here, pulled the trees in around us, curled our backs to the wind, no one had ever hit the moon—no one. now our trees are safer than the stars, and only other people's neglect is our precious and abiding shell, pierced by meteors, radar, and the telephone.  from our snug place we shout religiously for attention, in order to hide: only silence or evasion will bring dangerous notice, the hovering hawk of the state, or the sudden quiet stare and fatal estimate of an alerted neighbor.  this message we smuggle out in its plain cover, to be opened quietly: friends everywhere— we are alive! those moon rockets have missed millions of secret places! best wishes.  burn this.

 we’re headed for empty-headedness, the featureless amnesias of idaho, nebraska, nevada, states rich only in vowel sounds and alliteration. we’re taking the train so we can see into the heart of the heart of america framed in the windows’ cool oblongs of light. we want cottages, farmhouses with peaked roofs leashed by wood smoke to the clouds; we want the golden broth of sunlight ladled over ponds and meadows. we’ve never seen a meadow. now, we want to wade into one—up to our chins in the grassy welter—the long reach of our vision grabbing up great handfuls and armloads of scenery at the clouds’ white sale, at the bargain basement giveaway of clods and scat and cow pies. we want to feel half of america to the left of us and half to the right, ourselves like a spine dividing the book in two, ourselves holding the whole great story together.  then, suddenly, the train pulls into the station, and the scenery begins to creep forward—the ramshackle shapes of main street, a chevy dozing at a ribbon of curb, and here is a hound and a trolley, the street lights on their long stems, here is the little park and the park stuff: bum on a bench, deciduous trees, a woman upholstered in a red dress, the bus out of town sunk to its chromium bumper in shadows. the noise of a train gathers momentum and disappears into the distance, and there is a name strolling across the landscape in the crisply voluminous script of the title page, as though it were a signature on the contract, as though it were the author of this story.

 there are those for whom moving house is all so many pennies in a jar. it’ll all amount to something. i am more the alchemist; slowly, but not surely, making the mundane something precious. just as it is several floors above the street, my new flat is in nearly every way better than my old ground-floor one, all except for the cheap plastic toilet seat that wasn’t even bolted to the bowl. i took a dislike to it even before i’d started sliding left, right, and front and back every time i eased myself; sat there a-flipping and a-flopping in some kinda kooky pan’s people routine. no big deal; i now live amidst a jangle of pound shops and determined to purchase and attach a brand new model. i spotted a real bobby dazzler; clear resin filled with silver glitter. i liked it, it had a certain 1974 “gay bloke in a glam rock band” quality but, on reflection, did it give the message that i wanted to send, to ladies especially so? so i got plain wood. no mistaking that. however, this soon broke; too much cheesecake too soon? of course there’d been second thoughts, and my framed portraits of ingrid pitt and the sheer amount of reggae singles would surely choke any doubts about my dance moves raised by this, admittedly, exuberant toilet seat. i returned and purchased the glitter that could, perhaps, handle the weight of my pretensions. the bathroom is the one place where we truly relax, it hangs out, baby. we are confronted with the true selves we love, loathe, or try to avoid. both seat and lid molded stardust! my life has plopped into the plush. i’ve taken to hot, foamy baths with roxy music’s greatest hits pumping on the stereo. lathered with scented foam, i wonder about bryan ferry looking through an old picture frame. heavy is the head that wears the crown, thane of bathwater. us skinhead types aren’t known for our decadence, desmond excluded that is. even now i’m more coal tar than imperial leather. citrus mouthwash has appeared on my bathroom cabinet. i’ve even started using it twice daily, according to directions. outside, ermine street walks backwards to the gilt and butchery of londinium, then as now, my manor blinged up vermin. my street is a busy one, a dirty one, a loud one. police cars freeequently scream past, sirens forcing themselves in. it’s not the noise i object to. it’s the urgency. i’m all for the fight against crime but surely it can be done in a more sherlock holmes and gentlemanly languid manner? iniquity is a mire, into which we are sinking, or a briar catching at us with thorns. i forget which, although i note that these encompass both descent and ascension. the road to hell may be paved with good intentions but the road to whitechapel, is laid far less savory. the commercial tavern, once a trysting place for east end homosexualists, is now frequented by “artists” and the like. i work around the corner and am there for the lock in. for all its bustling traffic, commercial street crawls slower than most of london. painters whine, beer flows, brasses ply their trade; much the same as in the ripper’s heyday. i am introduced to and shake hands with the new landlord; tall, louche, pastel open-necked yet masculine shirt, sovereigns all heads, blond flipped hair    ...    no less than bryan ferry in negative! the police speed past, the prostitutes splash.

 we were up late and everyone had been drinking, and someone said, hey, is that god’s head on the boil? we didn’t know where to look or what to think, it was obviously some sort of perverse joke, or not, right? and the conversation went on for days, sober, drunk, asleep, awake, what did it matter? some of us felt the real time was for something, but what? and the questions kept coming, once they started, my favorite one being two strung together, what makes art “modern” and what does “urgent” mean now? where was the greater good? that was another one bandied about, followed by where was the common tent? which gave a feeling of empathy for a minute and then grief because, well, where was it? will you arm, hoard seeds, go hungry? those terrified me because, after all, who will repair things when the end is pale or dark? where will you hide out  when capital runs out, when water? which will be greater, the heat or the cold? wait, did god’s boiling head just say something? cry out go to hell from a giant lobster pot? tantalizing us with where to go next? are phosphorescent lamps to mark escape paths? not that it’s not a great party, but whose place is this? igniting quail in banana leaves, sons bandaged, who invited us? why are the emerald bleeding and the ivory weeping? (lower the freaking music.) does anyone have the time?

 the truck grinds by and pumps out grit; the road glints and goes still.  the barn owl that had not finished here returns. but with its fill  of scavenges, face ruffled in mulch, the vole is lost and safe  so the silent specter flits away, its moon face to the moon  and rears unknown against a copse, claws tipped for the strafe  and something dies too soon.

 george sandys (1578–1644), translator of ovid’s metamorphosis englished, mythologized, and represented in figures, and resident treasurer of the virginia company for its settlement at jamestown (1621–1624). i. a long voyage , 1621  i left you where you are: a humming late summer afternoon &amp; mottled by shade a man reading a letter becomes the image of a man reading that i am forgetting. this page is small yet stout enough to bear me whole upon it to you all the way in london. i may expand myself at leisure then fold it tight, a sanctuary; like our vessel christened the george, my letter is another ark to preserve me: george.  no midnight is so private as the sea’s: timbers breathe, a loose rope snaps,&amp; as the wind shoves you behind then slaps your face, seeing nothing, nothing to be seen, you feel unhoused, evicted from time. but tonight, my love, my lamp is feathered, shy, herald of the next ransack &amp; assail. behold the storm petrel! gray wick-threaded throat burning the oil secreted, an amber musk of uncompassed seas &amp; the solitary hunt, of error &amp; sign,&amp; that delirium—which turned our ship’s boy to mowing fields of atlantic salt. like windrows he dropped the waves.  until gaffed, pulled like a sleeve through himself, he will live, tongue-bit, torn. to return likely to a stool set on the shale where he can mend nets skirted by braggarts who have never traveled farther than the smoke dribbling from their chimneys. i try never to imagine drowning. noisy urgent inefficiencies above, waves pummeling, sky shredding,&amp; the body anchored only in its just longing for air. the tighter death’s embrace, the more languorous the moment. so this boy suffered some vast charity of sight. he was what he saw, an adam. now he may be adamant &amp; stain &amp; distance; &amp; also that small satin interruption of terror—the instant breath’s orphaned by self’s perishing through poetry. like daphne his voice is forfeit for the song, but we do not grieve for daphne.  my bird-light gutters. its call had sounded like dry wood giving up a nail.  what is this your wound that you must follow it? for you i had no answer; consider only the reveries of the carpet navigator in his room. listening to collisions of wave &amp; star outside his tower, rock-rapt, icebound, with a mind by dread &amp; ceremony &amp; the dozen arts of courtesy girded, he invented those ideal earths in latitudes unstrung that i now trespass—  after i had translated two books to the pouring of seas &amp; clamor of sailors i began to brood long on landlessness, coming to believe it my sovereign, my home, when on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flaw: a color merely, private, ethereal, collecting heft in the warp of time. days before we quailed at the barbed illegible pelt of forest, i wrecked, forlorn upon its savor, sweet damage of apples fermenting in rain-soaked hay, giving way to something ranker— i tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue. i am his majesty’s servant as my god made me; i am also my damps &amp; exaltations; i am afraid.  heaven &amp; hell enlisted their geographers, a map has opened the soul’s five hinges,&amp; persian with expectance how often have i feasted on departure. london, naples, marriage, damascus, now your dear person. so much flowing through me my sight has silted dark my mouth. i beg all the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds —dolphin, mockingbird, muscovy bear—to tell this arrival, so unforeseen, disorderly as my hope you will not forget who i was,&amp; am, unwildered, unwestered, constant, returning.  bless you where you are,&amp; where you would be when you are there,&amp; bring you thither. my love, what may never not be strange? what, this morning, will wake &amp; make me new.   ii. winter 1621   it begins like a legend told to a fretful child: it was, it was, and it was not. it begins as if with symptoms of that sweat i hear, so late (oh not thank god too late), you were spared: a little blush along the throat. a restlessness. then the silkworm’s casement, tapering &amp; pale as the egg of a chimney-swift, which we will convert to cloth to cover the naked indian. a bobbin, which dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstrom of silk. spindle of whirlwind, spoonful of follow. the thread’s stained scalding mile pours out my glass tempered in our kiln, as each new settler is also seasoned in this furnace, our new-found land. (as the man drowning believes he digests the mild water, as the damned marry flame &amp; yet blister, so do i know myself grasped by change at the stroke of change.) hold this glass up to your eye &amp; through its pebbled horizon you may spy your room, see its ire of surfaces sore with chairs. green grass green grace... would that i could account this world one where nothing is lost only exchanged.  without coppice, park, romancely glade, or commanding vantage, woods press on us; they fester, &amp; they watch. to the northeast white spruce, phalanxes of fledging pinions, clamp root to granite &amp; hoard what they glean off salt-fog, sea-spray,&amp; stone. from ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams. at breakfast i have pinched the plantlets insinuated by a maple’s winged seed overnight; it unclasps twin leaves, pale hands loosening the soil of my rest, they never empty of their solicitations.  i find no empires here, no apostles or emeralds. instead, all things a-broil with an awful begetting &amp; my hours unsettled by some new show of riotous &amp; mystical imagination. though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tight to shore’s edge, our foundation raised on marshland recalls this irritable fact— the estuary, a nursery of strange devices, throws off new forms so promiscuously i wonder how the world holds any more shape than a dream?  from my hand at night (my light a little oil in a dish or a rush taper smoking not so different from his), flower ovid’s fantastic shapes, shadows of an old empire’s former splendor now perjured by virginia’s clay &amp; leaf &amp; sand turned to the king’s profit as iron, silk,&amp; glass. belief is possible at night, solitary, firelit. then, i can believe in ovid’s centaurs, or at death that he was met by a three-headed dog. i can believe in your letters, which never come.  it is for you that i persist in translating fresh birdsong, like this bunting’s comecomecome wherewherewhere all together      down the hill. (where did they go, who went before us? starved trove: scatter of blue beads &amp; a name grafted to that bald acre. roanoke. there is my terror &amp; my tale: to go west under this eternity of nameless trees.)  and what will you make of this humble hieroglyphic of nature i forward to you? nocturnal, double-wombed, variously called monkey fox; frosted, or short-headed, or indolent. let this leafy-eared rat-tailed shuffler the naturals call possoun join your zoo’s other fantasies &amp; with the little military learnéd horse enjoy its dish of ale. its fur is durable; its flesh wholesome, white,&amp; pleasant.  with one hand i can reach for a medicine man’s last breath caught in a vial or a hummingbird, stuffed with arsenic &amp; leaves &amp; looking like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart, with the other hand i brush away the web spun in a fox skull’s whitened socket while a wild turkey glowers from its corner like a small dyspeptic dragon. my cullings do not quite master my closet. when i imagine myself returned to the smells &amp; noise of london, from my stiff knee sands grinding as i walk, no marvels except those which the mirror surprises in all of us, the swan-white wing at my temple, i do not know what to hope for: that you do not see me, or that you do, but as though i were pinned under glass.  at my windowsill a quince widens a jaundiced eye into the dark where are real nettles beneath the words &amp; invincible red root of the madder. as long as any image of this world sticks in my soul, i remain—   iii. spring 1622

 o dove, fly to aleppo with my byzantine ode and take my greeting to my kinsman. –mahmoud darwish before i was born, i saw a tissue of ingenious detours, an inextricable tangle wreathed with mistake. perhaps the ghost does not limp away, but rather forests flee me, frightened. look, they are setting a place for loss, clearing the table for the first glow of antiquity. here we see william t. walters in his little library illuminated, carefully smoothing the lip of the continent. what form bounds forward from behind but the atlantic railroad coastline co.? the whole roman empire was sold by ascending auction in 193 a.d. a globe enclosed. bottomless years. the train has stopped on the platform and no one is there, for these are the public days, when the “poor association” claims the museum’s building. as if bound by the knots of invention, i found a wrong road dotted with weeds and sorrows.

 perhaps the universe is an extinguished building with blue banners strung along and the forest, more like a commodity bordering bushes and asphalt,  something else to string our blue banners on. never was restoration swifter: the leafless trees, the asphalt less splintered and more splendid.  never was restoration swifter with its mightier solutions, less splintered and more splendid snipers, dynamiters, colorful bombs.  we please ourselves with mightier solutions, picnics under blue spruces snipers, dynamiters, colorful bombs the guardians of what we might call “home rights.”  at picnics, under blue spruces we clamor after the news and its employees, the guardians of “home rights” “the media” mustering “one mind.”  it’s news, the decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose some pretense of mustering “one mind” secures its truth.  the decision to nobly save rather than meanly lose our flag secures its truth as a squirrel secures its nuts by hiding them in the ground.  our flag— a souvenir of having been here before a squirrel’s nuts, deep in the ground. but travel, travail, and the method’s mistakes  all souvenirs of having been here before, haunt us and taunt us and call us names. but travail, travel, and method’s mistakes mark a different season, nuts rotting, bulbs blooming.  each season haunts us and taunts us and calls us names until finally the universe is an extinguished building, a different season, nuts rotting, bulbs blooming and the forest, a commodity.

 we bury the sparrows of europe with found instruments, their breasts light as an ounce of tea where we had seen them off the path, their twin speeds of shyness &amp; notched wings near the pawnbroker’s house by the canal, in average neighborhoods of the resisters, or in markets of princely delphinium &amp; flax, flying from awnings at unmarked rates to fetch crumbs from our table half-spinning back to clefs of grillwork on external stairs we would descend much later;  in rainy neighborhoods of the resisters where streets were taken one by one, where consciousness is a stair or path, we mark their domains with notched sticks of hickory or chestnut or ash because our cities of princely pallor should not have unmarked graves. lyric work, flight of arch, death bridge to which patterned being is parallel: they came as if from the margins of a painting, their average hearts half-spinning our little hourglass up on the screen.

 they explained to me the bloody bandages on the floor in the maternity ward in rochester, n.y., cured the backache i acquired bowing to my old master, made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed.  they showed me an officer on horseback, waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse and a barefoot woman in a nightgown, throwing stones after him and calling him lucifer.  i was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls. come dark a chicken would roost in my hair. some even laid eggs as i played my ukulele and my mother and father crossed themselves.  next, i saw myself inside an abandoned gas station constructing a spaceship out of a coffin, red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers, when a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear.  some days, however, they opened door after door, always to a different room, and could not find me. there’d be only a small squeak now and then, as if a miner’s canary got caught in a mousetrap.

 hirto corde gigni quosdam homines proditur, neque alios fortioris esse industriae, sicut aristomenen messenium qui trecentos occidit lacedaemonios ... —plinii, naturalis historia xi. ixx. the guards sleep they breathe uneven conversation with the trees the sharp cicadas and knots of pine the flames have stirred to talk: their light  shows him rolling in his bonds as if he dragged his bones again beyond a tall and ghosted mist of blood; he took three hundred lives  and will not give his own for capture even. the smell of searing hemp and flesh startles as the scream of birds— should wake the guards of men  or dead. the fire flares and frames a running giant his wrists caught between his thighs; a burned and awkward god. once he tried the foxes’  paths out of the shattered quarry. no way now. one may kill his hundreds; still no way. how can he live without his heart. throw him  to the ground and prepare knives! do they by their hate or wonder break the breast he shut to fear? mock or pray as they cut flesh  crush ribs and lay all open to the alien chill of air? no scream tears from him; the tiny veins along his eyelid swell  and pools of sweat gather at its corners. but they do not see his slowly swinging eyes. they watch his heart; its brown hair is whorled and dry.

 for laura the island, you mustn’t say, had only rocks and scrub pine; was on a blue, bright day like a blemish in this landscape. and charlotte who is frail and the youngest of us collects sticks and branches to start our fires, cries as they burn because they resemble most what she has lost or has little of: long fingers, her toes, and a left arm gone past the elbow, soon clear to her shoulder. she has the mouth of sea perch. five of our sisters wear green hoods. you are touched by all of this,but not by us. to be touched by us, to be kissed! sometimes we see couples rowing in the distance in yellow coats.  sometimes they fish with handlines; we offend everyone who is offended most and by everything and everyone. the five goats love us, though, and live in our dark houses. when they are full with milk they climb the steps and beg that they be milked. their teats brush the steps and leave thick yellow trails of fresh milk. we are all females here. even the ghosts. we must wash, of course, in salt water, but it smarts or maybe even hurts us. often with a rope around her waist anne is lowered entirely into the water. she splashes around and screams in pain. her screams sometimes carry clear to the beaches on the cape.  for us i say so often. for us we say.for us! we are human and not individual, we hold everything in common. we are individual, you could pick us out in a crowd. you did. this island is not our prison. we are not kept in; not even by our skin.  once anne said she would love to be a negro or a trout.  we live without you. father, i don’t know why i have written you all this; but be proud for i am living, and yet each day i am less and less your flesh. someday, eventually, you should only think of me as being a lightning bug on the lawn, or the negro fishing at the pond, or the fat trout he wraps in leaves that he is showing to someone. i’ll be  most everything for you. and i’ll be gone.

 aggressive panhandling, public urination, verbal threats, public nudity and violation of the open container law followed us down the days, for why are we here much longer, or even this long? i ask you to be civil and not interrupt night’s business.  it was fun getting used to you, who couldn’t have been more nicer. this was as modern as it had ever been. they were influenced by him: some dirty magazine on the air tonight. (amid the chaos, reports of survivors.)  didn’t the flowers’ restoration cat fugue keep spilling, and like that? it wouldn’t be the first time, either. the pro-taffeta get up and laugh, investigate or communicate. the night you were going to stay up late, others will kiss, and he talks about you, and i don’t know what. come in, anyway, and don’t lack for tales of the assertion.  we’re talking civilian unrest. yes, well, maybe you should take one.

 i have met people who, asked after their names, shyly—as if they had no title to an appellation all to themselves— replied “fräulein christian” and added: “like the first name,” they wanted to make it easy for the other, not a difficult name like “popiol” or “babendererde”— “like the first name”—please, don’t burden your memory overmuch!  i have met people who grew up in a single room with their parents and four brothers and sisters, and studied at night with their fingers in their ears at the kitchen table, and grew up to be beautiful and self-possessed as duchesses— and innerly gentle and hard-working as nausicaa, clear-browed as angels.  i have often asked myself and never found an answer whence kindness and gentleness come, i don’t know it to this day, and now must go myself.  
NEW POEM
 1  i seek a permanent home, but this structure has an appearance of indifferent compoundedness and isolation, heading toward hopelessness.  the boy pulls an animal on a leash.  the house with a red roof rests between two hills.  i can look through its windows to the sea.  his aggression opposes what in a domestic animal, cold open space, large enough to work with isolation?  house is the projection, space around it intermediary, theater.  you don’t have to consume the space to exist, distance, point-to-point, in which a beloved ruin is middle ground, for example.    2  first house and space negate one another.  then, they’re a series.  the boy watches a mouse run around the rim of a lampshade.  he relates wanting to catch a mouse with the room, ground.  wanting a master image obscures ground, like objects in space.  house and space are composite, like my dream, a bubble, lightning, starting point and any second place.    3  rain pours out a gutter onto the poor horse.  horse runs under a tin roof supported by poles.  stockpiles of beams, salvaged wood, brick melt into contextless waste.  i understand the situation by perceiving parts, one after another, then reversing in a glance that removes time.  so, i can intuit contextless waste as ground.    4  the water tank sits on a frame of used wood, like a packing crate.  i look through it to an extinct volcano.  the panorama is true figuratively as space, and literally in a glass wall, where clouds appear like flowers, and the back-lit silhouette of a horse passes by.  a file of evergreens secures the cliff amid debris from a crew bilding, as at the edge of the sea.  oranges, dumplings, boiled eggs take on the opaque energy of a stranger.  knowledge as lintel, bond beam (model signs) holds the world at a distance.  a master image like bone condenses from the indistinct point-to-point feeling of self with which construction began.  my house returns from outside, as if my spirit had been blocking my path, when i wasn’t going anywhere in particular.    5  materials and freedom combine, so materials aren’t subjective.  the material of space is like having a skeleton to gain a vantage point on seamless distance, as in a comparison.  it’s a style of accumulating materials that does not become a solid thing, anymore.  accommodating a view by being able to be seen through is perceptual, not abstract, like space painted white.  give a house the form of an event.  relate it to something there, a form of compassion.  your point of view is: it’s solid already, so there’s warmth.  in this primitive situation, pure form translates a former empire of space as wilderness.  chinese space breaks free from the view in front of me, while my house continues to rotate on earth.  
NEW POEM
 in the rearview, fog extinguishes the hills of new money—mansions on acres away from road or sight. their architected privacy, windows to look out at a land that won't look back. the fog's secure drapery. it's space to dance through they buy and what one might call "dappled light" moving across their acres, light through their oaks moving over their mares, brushed to a sheen.  •   palms of sugar cubes. soft snorting, i bet. here, muybridge proved their horses fly a moment. in their homes, they can't hear each other call from foyer to pool house. i am jealous of this loneliness most of all—loneliness delimited by colonnade and cold pressed juices. they make excellent corpses, among the expensive flowers.... i imagine hills and hills dappled like this.

 like guns and cars, cameras are fantasy-machines whose use is addictive. —susan sontag  i place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means i learn to ignore it. he stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. last night i smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. a promise i broke myself. he promised himself he wouldn't and did. i smell my fingers and i am smelling his. hands of smoke and gunpowder. hands that promised they wouldn't, but did.            this album is a stop-loss . by a dim lantern or in the latrine he flips through it. he looks at himself looking nearly as he does— closest to himself then as he could be, just learning how to lean into his new body. he suspends there by standing order,  a spreading fire in his chest, his groin. he is on stage  for us to see him, see him? he stands in the noontime sun.      a young soldier (pictured above) the son of an imam, brother to six, is among the latest casualties in the military campaign of susangerd.     your whole body in a photo your whole body sitting on a crate pressing your eyesocket to the viewfinder of a bazooka crouched as you balance the metal tube on your shoulder in one you guide a belt of ammo into the untiring weapon proud your elbow out as if mid-waltz your frame strong and lightly supporting the gun a kind of smile ruining the picture            you’re posing. you’re scared. a body falls and you learn to step over  a loosened head. you begin to appreciate the heft of your boot soles, how they propel you,  how they can kick in a face– the collapse  of a canopy bed in an aerial bombardment, mosquito netting doused  in napalm–cheekbones fragile as moth wings beneath the heel. you tighten your laces  until they hold together a capable man. whatever rains,  the weight of your feet swings you forward, goose-stepping pendulums  a body less and less yours– a body, god knows, is not what makes you  anyway. so the hands that said they never would begin finding  grenade pins around their fingers, begin flipping through this album with soot under their nails       you were not ready but they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug but to watch you sitting there between the sandbags but to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes but what did they expect but what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent but i sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets but it was not a table of fallen men but my hand registered fatigue but the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts but you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers were tired but the code for shiraz was down but all of shiraz was down but the sheet lightning above the ferris wheel of rusted bolts but i am sure they are alright you wrote well to reassure yourself but the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside my window but what i mean is i'd like very much to talk a bit  hello           operation ramadan was an offensive in the iran-iraq war . it was launched by iran in july 1982 near basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since world war ii . aftermath :the operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. this one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. in retrospect, the iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. saddam hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the revolutionary regime.

 after elinor lipper the creature that had once been a man handed over his petition, a stained and grimy scrap, handed it to his lord and master, a petition asking to be transferred to the status of a horse. you son-of-a-whore, the master, kicking for good measure, bellowed. what do you mean by this? the creature that had once been a man, having considered deeply his petition, answered: if i were a horse, i would have one day off in ten. as is, i have none. as a horse, i could rest now and again during work. as a former man, i cannot. as a horse, i would be expected to perform work equal to my strength. as a prisoner, i am always hungry, and hungry, i work less and get less bread, so i can barely stand. a horse gets a stable and two blankets. i have no blankets, no jacket. if a driver beats a horse too hard, he is punished, for a horse is precious. if the brigadiers beat and kick me, it is like beating a tree. so you see, a prisoner is nothing here. but a horse? a horse is something! inside the frozen and the broken vista, the plea had a ring of truth heard even by the lord and master, who had previously been a man himself, and who, when no other former men could see, attached that name to the page, granting the horse a stable and two blankets.

 1  we call change in a person the effect of time, witness my new dress, so short, with buttons on the yoke shaped like swans.  i enter from the back of the room, pausing at the hopeful energy of people gathered to see me.  they are a surface, alive and redolent, half unseen, like iridescent cloth.  i sense structure spontaneously form, as when crossing the room to greet you, what i say forms.  and i worry that spontaneity acts for its own reasons, not mine.  my dress is a visual image of unconscious affirmative processes, the way spontaneity expresses its order, as i create a world, stocking it with small dogs on the runway, handbags, a bouillonne of rose tulle at the waist of a jacket.  so, i'm not limited to what i observe, rather than feel.   2  they assess quite accurately my choice of babydoll dress as value for others.  each absorbs encouragement from her assessment, even though every being's imprinted with data to create every appearance.  seeing a leaf may reveal knowledge that communicates instantly among microbes, which can change in a wink.  so, the optimistic idea would be the most biologically pertinent one.  i dress to express a hoped for solution.  rachel's blouse, for example, is not purple just for photographers' enjoyment.  flowers are intrinsic to her feeling for her value, she seeks by expression to extend.  each guest creates her own sumptuous panoply from my honey sable coat over silvery pajamas, new, vintage, because of simultaneous time, therefore matter.  so, physical change is not time, as such.   3  i feel love from the fashion community as light from photographs of others' bodies as light from their scrutiny of my photograph in a dress bold enough to sustain the penetration of disembodied light of my entrance.  to audience, unnamed cutters, sewers, embroiderers, beaders i attribute this beauty, when meaning i.e., style, is given a sympathetic presence.  mirroring touches it, like exquisite jet beads on a gray coatdress in almost transparent bouclé, clusters of dark stones on the shoulder.  a loose blouse in cream silk crepe is tied at the sleeves with glistening cellophane ribbons.  you feel i understand your own contingency plans.  do you remember my show in london, when all the models were drunk, broken glass everywhere?  fashion does that, giving shape and color to our inarticulate impulses.  i present the contemporary as liminal, transitions, transparencies.  you nurture the uncontained confusion, when no permeable resonance has yet formed.  the gray is cloudy, deep, but without melancholy.   4  before dinner, we're asked to sign the guestbook on a boulle console in the hall.  people i've seen in magazines seem very tall, their features enlarged from being photographed.  each appearance has a materiality more significant than we usually expect from bodies.  style, soul, is power through which matter is formed.  like historic change, a body can re-materialize in its chrysalis, when the life you know is left behind.  you're alone in a white brocade jacket with fur trim and frosting white cloque, a skirt of stiff flounces, like quartz crystals flecked with gold.  in this chrysalis, you now change the contemporary, viewing the past in extending light that's mobile around your body.  my dress is not stuck in time like a butterfly born in a jar, whose wings are therefore useless.   5  in the dining room, with ming wallpaper restored by young chinese artists, kiki wears a blue silk coat embroidered with gold.  i mention louise's white helmet, camilla on pewter platforms flashing to gold, light on water, what we mean visually by souls for whom the the body is potential, futural.  in my closet, there's no distinction between material and the intelligible.  when i continue to dress after i tell  him my dog has died, he begins to weep.  he asks how i can waste this evening chattering?  i say through tears i mourn my little dog, but that means little to him, because of my outfit.  he makes a mistake in reading, like a wrong accessory, inserting an extra vowel or syllable and changing the whole passage, though i don't usually wear sheer stockings with that dress.  it was a case of spontaneity, a transparent white warp like an open window through which a moment is perceived, unshaded by the physical.  and in fact, many in the room were not in good health.  through this window, i take in a non-causative molecule to change myself, what a mother administers, placebo, the intent of a dress.  when you wear it for the first time, you're surprised by a rush of feeling for yourself.

 without even leaving one’s door, one can know the whole world. —laozi the rumble of the night sounds even in the bright daylight of morning. life blooms amid the ten thousand things, but does not bloom amid the ten thousand things. shrivel-eyed i wake up and tend to the one here and now, clamoring to be let out. down with the gate, out with the boy, to the rooms of life’s necessities, first to void and next to fill. the order is only order which is disorder, the only disorder is the disorder that is order. we usher ourselves, each in our own way, back down the way for various brushings, combings, other groomings. each in our own way we urge the other toward some kind of growth: one to assume, the other to renounce; one to grow larger, the other to grow smaller, thereby growing larger. words do not work, and when they do not, other words might. this makes more sense than it seems, works more often than it doesn’t, except when it really doesn’t, and then that disorder creeps back in. in five minutes, a different challenge. in five hours, a different one. six more hours, the one is rubbing eyes, untangled like a dragon, shucked and undone like an oyster. the night slowly rolls abed and the words form stories form sleep, the sleep of the ten thousand things, the sleep that will echo the next day in the night’s rumbling sounds, in the bright light of morning.

 outside the window the mcgill smelter sent a red dust down on the smoking yards of copper, on the railroad tracks’ frayed ends disappeared into the congestion of the afternoon. ely lay dull  and scuffed: a miner’s boot toe worn away and dim, while my mother knelt before the philco to coax the detonation from the static. from the las vegas tonapah artillery and gunnery range the sound  of the atom bomb came biting like a swarm of bees. we sat in the hot nevada dark, delighted, when the switch was tripped and the bomb hoisted up its silky, hooded, glittering, uncoiling length;  it hissed and spit, it sizzled like a poker in a toddy. the bomb was no mind and all body; it sent a fire of static down the spine. in the dark it glowed like the coils of an electric stove. it stripped every leaf from every  branch until a willow by a creek was a bouquet of switches resinous, naked, flexible, and fine. bathed in the light of kdwn, las vegas, my crouched mother looked radioactive, swampy,  glaucous, like something from the planet krypton. in the suave, brilliant wattage of the bomb, we were not poor. in the atom’s fizz and pop we heard possibility uncorked. taffeta wraps whispered on davenports.  a new planet bloomed above us; in its light the stumps of cut pine gleamed like dinner plates. the world was beginning all over again, fresh and hot; we could have anything we wanted.

 fall a scrimage of yellow leaves today all over lincoln park like the mask of the yellow mule who travels between the next world and tibet inside its house of glass in the field museum by the lake. i am carrying the night. i am carrying it as if it were a dark blue dish with stars for the dinner of the dalai lama. it is the sky two nights ago; its voluptuous rich blue looks almost black before the word for blue had been invented; the clouds like continents, like huge, majestic prehistoric creatures moving in a dance; the stars are brilliant ants.  they may have died a billion years ago. i feel so happy.   it is as if i'm with my wife who's making sculpture miles and miles away on ada street. i like everything about her. the way an angel, say, might look upon this early autumn scene and love everything about it for its reality— these trees flanking the lagoon at fullerton are quiet as green fish, the pale khaki maple leaf lying on the ground, its veins intricate as the practice of a tartar cavalry, its delicacy like the penis of a cuttlefish, the grass pale lime and brown as dreams when they are turning brown is almost ghostly, the way the family album on the table in the livingroom has a gallery of ghosts. there is only wonder. like the wonder in the worn thighbone of the dinosaur we're allowed to touch as often as we want on the main floor of the field museum. i bike along the lake and watch the whiplash of the waves and think, i didn't have to be here in the first place: i could have been a star: or cuttlefish. the shadow of that tree.  or been one of the bees of oblivion in any ordinary orgasm. if there were no moon our hearts could take its place.

 0. the first line? “blackface is sometimes the truth.” the poet knows this will make fire.  ponders performing in some dark room, squinting at the black type— red gel spots like laser sights from a rifle big as a bus.  but here, the sniper stirs herbal tea, has a cell phone, the number of a woman the color of thrush wings.  for now: the sniper with the cell phone will be he.  he misses the next line beneath the spoon clanging in the mug like the clapper in a schooner’s alarm bell. the third line,  perhaps: “. . . the smoldering cork testifies . . .” or “. . . the moldy corpse terrifies . . .” he considers each. and wonders about the second line  —then about the girl he saw boarding the bus, what her name sounds like whispered in a dim room  of red candles, a radio where the poet is. “—ncing and bucking. and the yes and suh . . .”—he misses something else,  the new line of little to do with corks or corpses—courts, maybe— and what’s “. . . un a gold coin promise, layaway heaven with teeth and silence . . .”?  he is lost between a poem, a cell and a thrush’s wing.  so by this time the poet should probably place a refrain as this is going to be a long poem, long enough to make the poet famous.   1. blackface is sometimes the truth but with added emphasis. a boldface where the smoldering cork testifies.  [the issue is intent, nahmean? like what is nahmean whenyousee knows its way around the alleys of the tongue? what is nahmean, nahmean? and the intent is the issue, you see?] [nahmean?]  blackface is sometimes a lie but with added detail. a bold face where the smoldering cork testifies.   2. but to what? the sawdust packed pockets, the brogan’s salty shadow? to the straps? scraps off the hips of tin platters?  the train’s constant is a-comin? the minister’s constant that someday what is the cork, still smelling of cheap wine, some doe-  eyed muscatel, a poor man’s dream-color of velvet, some sap fresh from a cicada tableau to a night club in a sunday suit,  cardboard under his left sock, the bootblack ache slithering out above his ass, the bootblack cash kissed in waxy fingerprints  offered up, offered up to the waitress who won’t smile for a “what this get?” the bottle brought back, armpit warm? this cork, tossed to the floor  and kicked, a careless jig swung by a white chick, and rolled below a table awaiting some jittering negro, whose gig it is to eyeball  these corks, to swoop down, hands a pair of crows, to swoop up the cork, bear it backstage, to pull it from his pocket like a magician’s dove,  transform it into smoke and ovation.  what does this testify?  what is this truth?  why speak of the fire, the first kiss of flame to the cork?  watch bamboozled. that’s all i did.  what does this testify?   3. what is truth? again reading some magazine,  again waiting for the dressing room door to open:  fire gleaming off the platter like a breakfast of stars, burning cork  from portugal, and cork doesn’t sink in rough waters, like fine schooners  from portugal, and fire splits the blackness of dark like the fingers of sailors  from portugal, whose tongues teach new tongues to the lips in the darkness of blacks  from africa, and burn the sea into their faces like smoke in a blue lit  dressing room. and i close the magazine full of rappers swimming  in denim, ism smoke and wait for the door to open. the embers to ignite   4. dancing and bucking  spotlight’s prison-break eye and the sweat that lifts from the skull and the pancake sheen allowed for the cameras, the pancake  that will not run, and the clothes that cling to the mouths of wetness and the red gels that turn the words into spastic ants holding tiny cue cards!!!!!  but the stomach churn of memorization,no no no, the revisions on the other copy in the other notebook in the other room no no no the gimpy music stand  tilt, the red eye, the spotlight’s stomach, the prison-break sheen, the ants cling, the pancake mouth, the spastic words, the cameras lift, the clothes’ wetness,  the skull tilt, churn turn run no no no dance                buck   *   *   *   *  the yes and sir  the room. the books. hands telling what i know to a machine. alone. dreaming, yes, dreaming of pinning myself to journals like a prized butterfly. the ink of my beauty fading on the white pages.   5. a rusty bicycle is a copper skeleton against the mattress. through the chain link, children kneeling on the concrete  look lined for butchering. chewed sedans bleed into the street, into sewer bellies.  i’ve written these images too many times. dc is my ghetto— every black poet should have one, as every white poet should have  a movie-house or a lake. white poets have attractions.  black poets should also have grandmothers.  i have grandmothers—one living, one not. neither mopped any floor but her own. if i stand on their memories, i am too tall  to be jammed into a tenement. black birds peck at my journals. my fingers work grime into elm place in ledroit park, divine urine from florida ave  and goad fiends from t street’s throat. these are not my muses. an adjective. a noun. a simile. “ragged storefronts like beaten wives.”  i must imagine what might go on behind bricks, past the railing climbing up the stoops like wrought iron centipedes. the windows are open  sometimes at night. it was hot, one black grandmother had a pool. air conditioning. on days without smog,  you could see the sea or someone riding a horse past the liquor store. no one needs horses in altadena. here,  horses are diamond necklaces. diamond necklaces that shit in crosswalks. in dc there is a different kind of horse, and i need it for poems as i need ink.  it is not my muse, nahmean? one black grandmother didn’t sit in the back of buses. raleigh lay before her, already mopped. the crows are waiting  at the edge of the page. see, the madhouse that seeped out into ne before exploding into panhandlers stranded in phantom ants,  drifting mothers birthing flying dutchmen, that man who walked all the way to 6 th street swinging a golf club like a white woman dancing—  these are not my muses. they aren’t even mirrors.  they are cork awaiting flame.  blackface  is   sometimes.

 tonight hazard’s father and stepmother are having jazz for mcgovern. in the old game-room the old liberals listen as the quintet builds crazy houses out of skin and brass, crumbling the house of decorum, everybody likes that.  for decades they have paid for the refurbishing of america and they have not got their money’s worth. now they listen, hopeful, to the hard rock for mcgovern.  the ceiling in this palace needs fixing, the chalky blue paint is like an old heaven but there are holes and flaking. they had movies here when grandpa was solvent.  hazard desires his wife, the way people on the trains to the death camps were seized by irrational lust. she is the youngest woman in the room, he would like to be in bed with her now, he would like to be president.  he has not been to his studio in four days, he asks the bartender, a college boy with a ponytail, for more gin. he stands in the doorway. forsythia and lilac have overgrown the porch, there is the rich smell of wood-rot. what twenty years will do to untended shrubbery and america and hazard.  
NEW POEM
 the poor are many and so— impossible to forget.  no doubt, as day breaks, they see the buildings where they wish they could live with their children.  they can steady the coffin of a constellation on their shoulders. they can wreck the air like furious birds, blocking out the sun.  but not knowing these gifts, they enter and exit through mirrors of blood, walking and dying slowly.  and so, one cannot forget them.

 hanging from the beam, slowly swaying (such the law), gaunt the shadow on your green, shenandoah! the cut is on the crown (lo, john brown), and the stabs shall heal no more.  hidden in the cap is the anguish none can draw; so your future veils its face, shenandoah! but the streaming beard is shown (weird john brown), the meteor of the war.

 i begin the day like any other day: a decade staring back  in the rearview mirror of the wrecked pickup truck: you  standing so tall you’re already headless: until i turn around  the cornfield blurs into the torn edges of an atlas: pull your hands  out from under me to anoint this god- given country of yours: mottled bones  singing the anthem of a star- spangled nation: this land  given enough time to list its own possibilities: atrocities  like a blade of dusk resting on my throat, i bruise: by standing  i practice the sacred: &amp; kneel how the body was built  toward the bottomless insides of ghosts: the small of my back  the sacrum: they say, the five disciples with pocked faces  unlike your self-inflicted gunshot but a single entryway: an emptiness  full of faith:rise to me as only you would after god has left  you with these entrance wounds with no way out: the purpling field  that goes on &amp; on: recognizable as a heartbeat: a century-  long orbit around a cage of stained glass: broken, you  gather me in your image of failed flesh: piecing mirror  after mirror back together through the night until nobody forgets: one  hundred years of this landscape behind &amp; before us continues to stir — even if  the earth under our knees, under every american sky, had been turning west-  ward for centuries.

 1. reading the results  i don’t move, but the inside corner of my right eye turns glassy, then shatters,  hands focus more sharply.  i don’t move, but the pigeon shudders on the sill.  the door opens to a maze of wallpaper, family photos— their bliss-frieze burns the last unaffected corner of my sight, like molten karo.  my husband’s mouth collapses, and the air about his shoulders has crystallized. we don’t say a word, all the noise is around us, the letter, half-folded, on the desk, an albatross, a dove.   2. positive  because in those days there were no words for such things i took handfuls of vitamins and slept with a trumpet flower under my pillow, i ate at the kiev on second avenue at four every morning: enormous boiled potato pierogis shivering in pools of butter, little sides of sautéed onions, paper cups of pure sour cream, dr. brown’s cel-ray, no ice, as chaser,  but now when the call comes i’m sitting in the kitchen with two plastic funnels over my breasts and the pump on the coutner with its hydraulic suck and the cast iron sputtering of eggs, the kids already bickering at table, milk flowing into baby bottles, even now the word heroin makes me feel the lovely way a body can go slack from inside out.   3. a single drop  i’d never paid much mind to my implements, but now i paint “fire engine red”  on the handle of my razor, a single drop on my nail clippers, one long stroke on my lethal toothbrush  to cordon off my blood, i tend and sop each splash or seep, soiled band-aids, love-smeared sheets—  every bleeding gum, torn hangnail, paper cut, scrape, gully  of cracked lip another hazard, each  infectious throb now forever watched as i patrol my body’s raging arroyo  in the family bathroom, to keep my children safe from me.   4. paper gowns  x-rays, lab coat, and me wearing those delicate petals (gaping, cold through the sleeves). he asks me to extend my palms: the motion is of pushing away. breathe with your mouth, he says, soft tup, tup, tup, along my spine, as if checking a cantaloupe.  there is a piece of gum beneath the windowsill, green imprint of a thumb. we’re talking percentages, genotypes, we’re talking bundled pharmaceuticals. studies, it seems, are inconclusive.  i try to look at the big picture: a talc-free rubber glove at the edge of the trash, neither in, nor out. on the insurance card, raised numbers, black ink worn away. there's a girl on the street with her head back, the strap of her dress falling carelessly.

 i want you to know how it was, whether the cross grinds into dust under men’s wheels or shines brightly as a monument to a new era.  there was a church and one man served it, and few worshipped there in the raw light on the hill in winter, moving among the stones fallen about them like the ruins of a culture they were too weak to replace, too poor themselves to do anything but wait for the ending of a life they had not asked for. the priest would come and pull on the hoarse bell nobody heard, and enter that place of darkness, sour with the mould of the years. and the spider would run from the chalice, and the wine lie there for a time, cold and unwanted by all but he, while the candles guttered as the wind picked at the roof. and he would see over that bare meal his face staring at him from the cracked glass of the window, with the lips moving like those of an inhabitant of a world beyond this. and so back to the damp vestry to the book where he would scratch his name and the date he could hardly remember, sunday by sunday, while the place sank to its knees and the earth turned from season to season like the wheel of a great foundry to produce you, friend, who will know what happened.

 when you asked if it rained bees or poison you were asking the wrong question. again.  you still didn’t understand the difference between hurricanes and flooding. thus between  gods and humans. between your slum- lordy digs and the shacks i pass that cling  to old boards and huddle around each family. the yards marking the care of home.  everywhere something is falling on someone and i watch like an autumn  tourist tripping through the berkshires. i reach to catch a leaf. i try to straighten  a pisa-like sapling. the wind wraps around us both like a question mark and leaves  me standing, the sole witness on this end. i’m telling you about a place of silence.  you want it all to be a metaphor. i’m watching a front porch crumble. still, someone sits there.

 a poem for barack obama’s presidential inauguration each day we go about our business, walking past each other, catching each other’s eyes or not, about to speak or speaking.  all about us is noise. all about us is noise and bramble, thorn and din, each one of our ancestors on our tongues.  someone is stitching up a hem, darning a hole in a uniform, patching a tire, repairing the things in need of repair.  someone is trying to make music somewhere, with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum, with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice.  a woman and her son wait for the bus. a farmer considers the changing sky. a teacher says,take out your pencils. begin.  we encounter each other in words, words spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed, words to consider, reconsider.  we cross dirt roads and highways that mark the will of some one and then others, who said i need to see what’s on the other side.  i know there’s something better down the road. we need to find a place where we are safe. we walk into that which we cannot yet see.  say it plain: that many have died for this day. sing the names of the dead who brought us here, who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges,  picked the cotton and the lettuce, built brick by brick the glittering edifices they would then keep clean and work inside of.  praise song for struggle, praise song for the day. praise song for every hand-lettered sign, the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables.  some live by love thy neighbor as thyself, others by first do no harm or take no more than you need.

 talking to my friend emily, whose drinking patterns and extravagance of personal feeling are a lot like mine, i’m pretty convinced when she explains the things we do while drinking (a cocktail to celebrate the new account turns into a party that lasts till 3 a.m. and a terrific hangover) indicate a problem of a sort i’d not considered. i’ve been worried about how i metabolize the sauce for four years, since my second bout of hepatitis, when i kissed all the girls at christmas dinner and turned bright yellow christmas night, but never about whether i could handle it. it’s been more of a given, the stage set for my life as an artistic queer, as much of a tradition in these new york circles as incense for catholics or german shepherds for the blind. we re-enact the rituals, and our faces, like smoky icons in a certain light, seem to learn nothing but understand all. it comforts me yet isn’t all that pleasant, like drinking ripple to remember high school. a friend of mine has been drinking in the same bar for decades, talking to the same types, but progressively fewer blonds. joe lesueur says he’s glad to have been a young man in the fifties with his tab hunter good looks, because that was the image men desired; now it’s the puerto rican angel with great eyes and a fierce fidelity that springs out of machismo, rather than a moral choice. his argument is pretty convincing, too, except lots of the pretty blonds i’ve known default by dying young, leaving the field to the swarthy. cameron burke, the dancer and waiter at magoo’s, killed on his way home from the pines when a car hit his bike on the sunrise highway. henry post dead of aids, a man i thought would be around forever, surprising me by his mortality the way i was surprised when i heard he was not the grandson of emily post at all, just pretending, like the friend he wrote about in playgirl, blair meehan, was faking when he crashed every a list party for a year by pretending to be kay meehan’s son, a masquerade that ended when a hostess told him “your mother’s here” and led him by the hand to the dowager—woman, behold thy son—underneath a darkening conviction that all, if not wrong, was not right. by now henry may have faced the same embarrassment at some cocktail party in the sky. stay as outrageously nasty as you were. and patrick mack, locked into memory as he held court in the anvil by the downstairs pinball machine, and writhing as he danced in lita hornick’s parlor when the stimulators played her party, dead last week of causes i don’t know, as if the cause and not the effect were the problem. my blond friend chuck shaw refers to the bone- crusher in the sky, and i’m starting to imagine a road to his castle lit by radiant heads of blonds on poles as streetlamps for the gods, flickering on at twilight as i used to do in the years when i crashed more parties and acted more outrageously and met more beauties and made more enemies than ever before or ever again, i pray. it’s spring and there’s another crop of kids with haircuts from my childhood and inflated self-esteem from my arrival in new york, who plug into the history of prettiness, convincing to themselves and the devout. we who are about to catch the eye of someone new salute as the cotillion passes, led by blonds and followed by the rest of us, a formal march to the dark edge of the ballroom where we step out onto the terrace and the buds of the forsythia that hides the trash sprout magically at our approach. i toast it as memorial to dreams as fragile and persistent as a blond in love. my clothes smell like the smoky bar, but the sweetness of the april air’s delicious when i step outside and fill my lungs, leaning my head back in a first-class seat on the shuttle between the rowdy celebration of the great deeds to come and an enormous irish wake in which the corpses change but the party goes on forever.  
NEW POEM
 thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums, that beat to battle where he stands; thy face across his fancy comes, and gives the battle to his hands: a moment, while the trumpets blow, he sees his brood about thy knee; the next, like fire he meets the foe, and strikes him dead for thine and thee.  
NEW POEM
 barely twenty-five, he smells of yesterday’s spit and vomit, black beard droops in clumps from his drawn, sun-savaged face.  hanging from a string around his neck: a small holy book.  this man was once a child held against the breast of a mother who kissed his small meaty hands that smelled of milk and tears.  
NEW POEM
 prisoners guilty or not always look the same when they are released— patriarchs dethroned.  this one just passed through the gate head bowed despite not being tall his gestures like a bedouin’s entering the tent he carried on his back all day long.  cotton curtains, stone walls, the smell of burnt lime take him back to the moment the cold war ended.  the other day his sheet was hung up in the courtyard as if to flaunt the blood stain after a wedding night.  faces tarnished by sun surround him, all eyes and ears: “what did you dream of last night?” a prisoner’s dreams are parchment made sacred by its missing passages.  his sister is still discovering his odd habits: the bits of bread hidden in pockets and under his bed the relentless chopping of wood for winter.  why this fear? what can be worse than life in prison?  having choices but being unable to choose.  
NEW POEM
 one  from sappho to myself, consider the fate of women. how unwomanly to discuss it! like a noose or an albatross necktie the clinical sobriquet hangs us: codpiece coveters. never mind these epithets; i myself have collected some honeys. juvenal set us apart in denouncing our vices which had grown, in part, from having been set apart: women abused their spouses, cuckolded them, even plotted to poison them. sensing, behind the violence of his manner— “think i'm crazy or drunk?”—his emotional stake in us, as we forgive strindberg and nietzsche, we forgive all those who cannot forget us. we are hyenas. yes, we admit it.  while men have politely debated free will, we have howled for it, howl still, pacing the centuries, tragedy heroines. some who sat quietly in the corner with their embroidery were defarges, stabbing the wool with the names of their ancient oppressors, who ruled by the divine right of the male— i’m impatient of interruptions! i’m aware there were millions of mutes for every saint joan or sainted jane austen, who, vague-eyed and acquiescent, worshiped god as a man. i’m not concerned with those cabbageheads, not truly feminine but neutered by labor. i mean real women, like you and like me.  freed in fact, not in custom, lifted from furrow and scullery, not obliged, now, to be the pot for the annual chicken, have we begun to arrive in time? with our well-known respect for life because it hurts so much to come out with it; disdainful of “sovereignty,” “national honor;” and other abstractions; we can say, like the ancient chinese to successive waves of invaders, “relax, and let us absorb you. you can learn temperance in a more temperate climate.” give us just a few decades of grace, to encourage the fine art of acquiescence and we might save the race. meanwhile, observe our creative chaos, flux, efflorescence—whatever you care to call it!   two  i take as my theme “the independent woman,” independent but maimed: observe the exigent neckties choking violet writers; the sad slacks of stipple-faced matrons; indigo intellectuals, crop-haired and callus-toed, cute spectacles, chewed cuticles, aced out by full-time beauties in the race for a male. retreating to drabness, bad manners, and sleeping with manuscripts. forgive our transgressions of old gallantries as we hitch in chairs, light our own cigarettes, not expecting your care, having forfeited it by trying to get even.  but we need dependency, cosseting, and well-treatment. so do men sometimes. why don’t they admit it? we will be cows for a while, because babies howl for us, be kittens or bitches, who want to eat grass now and then for the sake of our health. but the role of pastoral heroine is not permanent, jack. we want to get back to the meeting.  knitting booties and brows, tartars or termagants, ancient fertility symbols, chained to our cycle, released only in part by devices of hygiene and personal daintiness, strapped into our girdles, held down, yet uplifted by man’s ingenious constructions, holding coiffures in a breeze, hobbled and swathed in whimsy, tripping on feminine shoes with fool heels, losing our lipsticks, you, me, in ephemeral stockings, clutching our handbags and packages. our masks, always in peril of smearing or cracking, in need of continuous check in the mirror or silverware, keep us in thrall to ourselves, concerned with our surfaces. look at man’s uniform drabness, his impersonal envelope! over chicken wrists or meek shoulders, a formal, hard-fibered assurance. the drape of the male is designed to achieve self-forgetfulness.  so, sister, forget yourself a few times and see where it gets you: up the creek, alone with your talent, sans everything else. you can wait for the menopause, and catch up on your reading. so primp, preen, prink, pluck, and prize your flesh, all posturings! all ravishment! all sensibility! meanwhile, have you used your mind today? what pomegranate raised you from the dead, springing, full-grown, from your own head, athena?   three  i will speak about women of letters, for i’m in the racket. our biggest successes to date? old maids to a woman. and our saddest conspicuous failures? the married spinsters on loan to the husbands they treated like surrogate fathers. think of that crew of self-pitiers, not-very-distant, who carried the torch for themselves and got first-degree burns. or the sad sonneteers, toast-and-teasdales we loved at thirteen; middle-aged virgins seducing the puerile anthologists through lust-of-the-mind; barbiturate-drenched camilles with continuous periods, murmuring softly on sofas when poetry wasn’t a craft but a sickly effluvium, the air thick with incense, musk, and emotional blackmail.  i suppose they reacted from an earlier womanly modesty when too many girls were scabs to their stricken sisterhood, impugning our sex to stay in good with the men, commencing their insecure bluster. how they must have swaggered when women themselves endorsed their own inferiority! vestals, vassals, and vessels, rolled into several, they took notes in rolling syllabics, in careful journals, aiming to please a posterity that despises them. but we’ll always have traitors who swear that a woman surrenders her supreme function, by equating art with aggression and failure with femininity. still, it’s just as unfair to equate art with femininity, like a prettily packaged commodity when we are the custodians of the world’s best-kept secret: merely the private lives of one-half of humanity.  but even with masculine dominance, we mares and mistresses produced some sleek saboteuses, making their cracks which the porridge-brained males of the day were too thick to perceive, mistaking young hornets for perfectly harmless bumblebees. being thought innocuous rouses some women to frenzy; they try to be ugly by aping the ways of men and succeed. swearing, sucking cigars and scorching the bedspread,  slopping straight shots, eyes blotted, vanity-blown in the expectation of glory:she writes like a man! this drives other women mad in a mist of chiffon. (one poetess draped her gauze over red flannels, a practical feminist.)  but we’re emerging from all that, more or less, except for some ladylike laggards and quarterly priestesses who flog men for fun, and kick women to maim competition. now, if we struggle abnormally, we may almost seem normal; if we submerge our self-pity in disciplined industry; if we stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors; if we regard ourselves formally, respecting our true limitations without making an unseemly show of trying to unfreeze our assets; keeping our heads and our pride while remaining unmarried; and if wedded, kill guilt in its tracks when we stack up the dishes and defect to the typewriter. and if mothers, believe in the luck of our children, whom we forbid to devour us, whom we shall not devour, and the luck of our husbands and lovers, who keep free women.  
NEW POEM
 the cheap dropped ceiling jumped like a pot-lid boiling when our upstairs neighbor chased his girl that winter. falling out of  summer’s skimpy tops she’d want our phone. her plush lips creased. not exactly blonde, but luteous , we thought, pleased the right word  was there for that shade of slightly slutty mermaid. wincing, we’d hear him punch along the floor on crutch- es, a giant  bat trying to mince a mayfly. sex and violence you called them; blondie with dagwood on crystal meth, i’d tell our friends  over dinners stewed in noise. even his truck cowed. black, smoked glass, outsized wheels flaunted like chrome knuckles we shrank from, ducked,  afraid we’d find her later, knocking at our door. some nights we waited through like captured prey. to you i’d turn in bed,  saying the furtive words against your back, i love  ... you’d stroke my hair, or hip, all our years the same flip crack, i do , too .  
NEW POEM
 you could drive out of this country and attack the world with your ambition, invent wonder plasmas, become an artist of the provocative gesture, the suggestive nod, you could leave wanting the world and return carrying it, a noisy bundle of steam and libido, a ball of fire balanced on your tongue, you might reclaim main street in a limo longer than a sermon, wave at our red faces while remembering that you were born a clod hopper, a farmer’s kid, and get over that hump once and for all by telling a great man’s stories— the dirty jokes of dictators, tidbits of presidential hygiene, insights into the psychotropic qualities of power and the american tradition of kissing moneyed ass. your uncle would still call you roy boy, pheasants sun themselves beside the tracks, waiting for the dew to burn off before their first flight, and corn grow so high that if you stood in the field you’d disappear, the fact aiming your eyes down the road.  
NEW POEM
 professional middle-class couple, 1927 by august sander  what justifies the inequality that issues her a tastefully square-cut ruby for her finger, him a suit whose rumpled, unemphatic dignity declares a life of working sitting down, while someone in a sweatshop has to squint and palsy sewing, and a continent sheds blood to pry the gemstone from the ground, could not be justice. nothing but the use to which they put prosperity can speak in their defense: the faces money makes, they demonstrate, don’t have to be obtuse, entitled, vapid, arrogantly strong; only among the burghers do you find a glance so frank, engaging, and refined, so tentative, so conscious of  its wrong.

 when one isn’t enough, you need two when two aren’t enough, you need four with four the progression begins, moving toward a number that schoolteachers will call absurd. question: how many men do you need to put up a house? answer: you need absurd men when one isn’t enough and two can’t do the work of one. and how much money should we give these men to compensate them? you need absurd coins when one coin sliced in half and handed out isn’t enough. and how many words do you need to transform them? absurd and absurd and absurd words when silence isn’t enough. this is what they call progression: absurd men aren’t enough for putting up the house, absurd coins don’t make them happy absurd words can’t dissuade them.

 to sing of wars, of captains, and of kings, of cities founded, common-wealths begun, for my mean pen are too superior things; or how they all, or each their dates have run, let poets and historians set these forth. my obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.  but when my wond’ring eyes and envious heart great bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er, fool, i do grudge the muses did not part ‘twixt him and me that over-fluent store. a bartas can do what a bartas will but simple i according to my skill.  from school-boy’s tongue no rhet’ric we expect, nor yet a sweet consort from broken strings, nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect. my foolish, broken, blemished muse so sings, and this to mend, alas, no art is able, ‘cause nature made it so irreparable.  nor can i, like that fluent sweet-tongued greek who lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain. by art he gladly found what he did seek, a full requital of his striving pain. art can do much, but this maxim’s most sure: a weak or wounded brain admits no cure.  i am obnoxious to each carping tongue who says my hand a needle better fits. a poet’s pen all scorn i should thus wrong, for such despite they cast on female wits. if what i do prove well, it won’t advance, they’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance.  but sure the antique greeks were far more mild, else of our sex, why feigned they those nine and poesy made calliope’s own child? so ‘mongst the rest they placed the arts divine, but this weak knot they will full soon untie. the greeks did nought but play the fools and lie.  let greeks be greeks, and women what they are. men have precedency and still excel; it is but vain unjustly to wage war. men can do best, and women know it well. preeminence in all and each is yours; yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.  and oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies, and ever with your prey still catch your praise, if e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes, give thyme or parsley wreath, i ask no bays. this mean and unrefined ore of mine will make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.

 they darken. in the sky over florence, the oblong clouds swell and darken. and hailstones lift back through the updrafts, thickening, darkening, until, swollen as bird eggs, they drop to the cobbled streets.  horses! the child galileo thinks, then peeks through the doorway to the shock of ten thousand icy hooves. at his back, his father is tuning violins, and because there is nothing sharper at hand  galileo saws through a captured hailstone with a length of e-string, the white globe opening slowly, and the pattern inside already bleeding its frail borders. layers and layers of ice—  like what? onion pulp? cypress rings? if only the room were colder, and the eye finer. if only the hand were faster, and the blade sharper, and firmer, and without a hint of song . . .

 this is not morning. there is a nastiness slowing your shoes, something you shouldn’t step in. it’s shattered beads, stomped flowers, vomit— such stupid beauty,  beauty you can stick a manicured finger into and through, beauty that doesn’t rely on any sentence the sun chants, it’s whiskey swelter blown scarlet.  call this something else. last night it had a name, a name wedged between an organ’s teeth, a name pumping a virgin unawares, a curse word. wail it, regardless,  weak light, bleakly triumphant, will unveil scabs, snippets of filth music, cars on collapsed veins. the whole of gray doubt slithers on solemn skin. call her new orleans.  each day she wavers, not knowing how long she can stomach the introduction of needles, the brash, boozed warbling of bums with neon crowns, necklaces raining.  she tries on her voice, which sounds like cigarettes, pubic sweat, brown spittle lining a sax bell the broken heel on a drag queen’s scarlet slings. your kind of singing.  weirdly in love, you rhumba her edges, drink fuming concoctions, lick your lukewarm breakfast directly from her crust. go on, admit it. you are addicted  to her brick hips, the thick swerve she elicits, the way she kisses you, her lies wide open. she prefers alleys, crevices, basement floors. hell, let her woo you.  this kind of romance dims the worth of soldiers, bends and breaks the back, sips manna from muscle, tells you leave your life. pack your little suitcase, flee what is rigid  and duly prescribed. let her touch that raw space between cock and calm, the place that scripts such jazz. let her pen letters addressed to your asking. you s-s-stutter.  new orleans’s, p-please. don’t. blue is the color stunning your tongue. at least the city pretends to remember to be listening. she grins with glint tooth,  wiping your mind blind of the wife, the children, the numb ritual of job and garden plot. gently, she leads you out into the darkness and makes you drink rain.

 warning to magistrates judges, who rule the world by laws, will ye despise the righteous cause, when th’injur’d poor before you stands? dare ye condemn the righteous poor, and let rich sinners ’scape secure, while gold and greatness bribe your hands?  have ye forgot or never knew that god will judge the judges too? high in the heavens his justice reigns; yet you invade the rights of god, and send your bold decrees abroad to bind the conscience in your chains.  a poisoned arrow is your tongue, the arrow sharp, the poison strong, and death attends where e’er it wounds: you hear no counsels, cries or tears; so the deaf adder stops her ears against the power of charming sounds.  break out their teeth, eternal god, those teeth of lions dyed in blood; and crush the serpents in the dust: as empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise, before the sweeping tempest flies, so let their hopes and names be lost.  th’almighty thunders from the sky, their grandeur melts, their titles die, as hills of snow dissolve and run, or snails that perish in their slime, or births that come before their time, vain births, that never see the sun.  thus shall the vengeance of the lord safety and joy to saints afford; and all that hear shall join and say, “sure there’s a god that rules on high, “a god that hears his children cry, “and will their sufferings well repay.”

 the curve of her hip where i’d lay my head, that’s what i’m thinking of now, her fingers gone slow through my hair on a blue day ten thousand miles off in the future somewhere, where the beer is so cold it sweats in your hand, cool as her kissing you with crushed ice, her tongue wet with blackberry and melon.  that’s what i’m thinking of now. because i’m all out of adrenaline, all out of smoking incendiaries.  somewhere deep in the landscape of the brain, under the skull’s blue curving dome— that’s where i am now, swaying in a hammock by the water’s edge as soldiers laugh and play volleyball just down the beach, while others tan and talk with the nurses who bring pills to help them sleep. and if this is crazy, then let this be my sanatorium, let the doctors walk among us here marking their charts as they will.  i have a lover with hair that falls like autumn leaves on my skin. water that rolls in smooth and cool as anesthesia. birds that carry all my bullets into the barrel of the sun.

 thousands of planes were flying and then they stopped. we spend days moving our eyes  across makeshift desks, we sit on a makeshift floor; we prepare for almost nothing that might happen.  early on, distant relations kept calling. now, nothing: sound of water  tippling a seawall. nothing: sparks lighting the brush, sparks polishing the hail,  the flotsam of cars left standing perfectly still. thud of night bird against night air,  there you are on the porch, swath of feathers visible through the glass,  there you are on the stairs where the cat fell like a stone because her heart stopped.  what have you found in the wind above town square? is it true that even the statues have gone?  is there really a hush over everything as there used to be in morning when one by one we took off our veils?

 i sit with my railroad face and ask god to forgive me for being a straight line toward the dead who were buried with their poor clothes in the arizona desert of iron borders.  this way of waving to the embers of the past, not apologzing for carrying torn rosaries inside my pockets where beads of worry became fossilized insects whose dry husks i kept since a child.  faces adopted me from boys who hated their parents. i was told not to repeat this, reminded by the priest who unmasked himself. i was told there was a great horror down the hallway of the smelly catholic school. once, my friend joey jumped off the second floor window and flattened his brains over the asphalt yard.  i see a hibiscus blossom. it is a bright yellow flower that lasts one day. its shape brings tears, saves me from the hummingbird that dots the air with patterns resembling an alphabet too familiar to smell like a railroad worker.  i love heaven when i admit the spikes and the railroad ties came from the labor of fate and not the labor of love. the tracks are my cross.  the tiny car is full of sweating men. they look into the eye of the sun, hold their hammers over their blackened heads. if staring grows in the common search, a perfume dots the heart with greed. silence between the lightning of pounding stakes.  once, i rode the train home to see if the smoke from the speeding engine was going to enter my lungs. i never wore the old, yellow hat of the crew, but returned the shovel and the bag of railroad spikes, thought i saw my grandfather, the foreman, running across the desert in overalls, changing his skin from brown to the black of the scorched engine.  i live with my railroad face, its smoothness hammered by sweating crews that knew the line of hot iron was going to end in the west someday. i live with my railroad face and don’t know why the tracks disappear on the horizon. i cross my railroad face and comb my hair.

 long before you see train the tracks sing and tremble, long before you know direction train come from, a hum announces it soon arrive. so we tend to drop on all fours even before we look left or right. we skip the sleepers or walk along by balancing on a rail. we talk about the capital where the train ends its run from the interior stacked with the outsized trunks of felled trees and open-topped cars of bauxite. we always hide from it unsure what the train will do if we stand next to the tracks. it flattens our nails into knives, it obliterates any traffic caught by it at crossroads, it whistles a battle cry, steam from the engine a mood not to mess with or else. rails without beginning or end, twinned hopes always at your back, always up front signaling you on, double oxen, hoof stomp, temper tantrum, stampede, clatter matter, head splitter, hear us, stooped with an ear to the line— greenheart, mora, baromalli, purple heart, crabwood, kabakalli, womara.

 it ends badly, this glass of wine, before you drink it you have to drink a prior glass, before you sip you gulp, before you chug the bottle you pour it down your throat, before we lie together naked, we divorce, before we rest we grow old, it ends in chaos, but it is delicious, when we wake it is the past, we are the faces staring from the high lit window, the unmet lovers, the rivals who do not exist, united in a radiance that will not fade at dawn.

 nolueram, belinda, tuos violare capillos; sedjuvat, hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis.  (martial, epigrams 12.84) what dire offence from am'rous causes springs, what mighty contests rise from trivial things, i sing—this verse to caryl, muse! is due: this, ev'n belinda may vouchsafe to view: slight is the subject, but not so the praise, if she inspire, and he approve my lays.  say what strange motive, goddess! could compel a well-bred lord t' assault a gentle belle? o say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd, could make a gentle belle reject a lord? in tasks so bold, can little men engage, and in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?  sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray, and op'd those eyes that must eclipse the day; now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake, and sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake: thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground, and the press'd watch return'd a silver sound. belinda still her downy pillow press'd, her guardian sylph prolong'd the balmy rest: 'twas he had summon'd to her silent bed the morning dream that hover'd o'er her head; a youth more glitt'ring than a birthnight beau, (that ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow) seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay, and thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.  "fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care of thousand bright inhabitants of air! if e'er one vision touch'd thy infant thought, of all the nurse and all the priest have taught, of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen, the silver token, and the circled green, or virgins visited by angel pow'rs, with golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs, hear and believe! thy own importance know, nor bound thy narrow views to things below. some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd, to maids alone and children are reveal'd: what tho' no credit doubting wits may give? the fair and innocent shall still believe. know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, the light militia of the lower sky; these, though unseen, are ever on the wing, hang o'er the box, and hover round the ring. think what an equipage thou hast in air, and view with scorn two pages and a chair. as now your own, our beings were of old, and once inclos'd in woman's beauteous mould; thence, by a soft transition, we repair from earthly vehicles to these of air. think not, when woman's transient breath is fled, that all her vanities at once are dead; succeeding vanities she still regards, and tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards. her joy in gilded chariots, when alive, and love of ombre, after death survive. for when the fair in all their pride expire, to their first elements their souls retire: the sprites of fiery termagants in flame mount up, and take a salamander's name. soft yielding minds to water glide away, and sip with nymphs, their elemental tea. the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome, in search of mischief still on earth to roam. the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair, and sport and flutter in the fields of air.  know further yet; whoever fair and chaste rejects mankind, is by some sylph embrac'd: for spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease assume what sexes and what shapes they please. what guards the purity of melting maids, in courtly balls, and midnight masquerades, safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark, the glance by day, the whisper in the dark, when kind occasion prompts their warm desires, when music softens, and when dancing fires? 'tis but their sylph, the wise celestials know, though honour is the word with men below.  some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face, for life predestin'd to the gnomes' embrace. these swell their prospects and exalt their pride, when offers are disdain'd, and love denied: then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain, while peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train, and garters, stars, and coronets appear, and in soft sounds 'your grace' salutes their ear. 'tis these that early taint the female soul, instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll, teach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know, and little hearts to flutter at a beau.  oft, when the world imagine women stray, the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way, thro' all the giddy circle they pursue, and old impertinence expel by new. what tender maid but must a victim fall to one man's treat, but for another's ball? when florio speaks, what virgin could withstand, if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand? with varying vanities, from ev'ry part, they shift the moving toyshop of their heart; where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive, beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive. this erring mortals levity may call, oh blind to truth! the sylphs contrive it all.  of these am i, who thy protection claim, a watchful sprite, and ariel is my name. late, as i rang'd the crystal wilds of air, in the clear mirror of thy ruling star i saw, alas! some dread event impend, ere to the main this morning sun descend, but heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where: warn'd by the sylph, oh pious maid, beware! this to disclose is all thy guardian can. beware of all, but most beware of man!"  he said; when shock, who thought she slept too long, leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue. 'twas then, belinda, if report say true, thy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux; wounds, charms, and ardors were no sooner read, but all the vision vanish'd from thy head.  and now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd, each silver vase in mystic order laid. first, rob'd in white, the nymph intent adores with head uncover'd, the cosmetic pow'rs. a heav'nly image in the glass appears, to that she bends, to that her eyes she rears; th' inferior priestess, at her altar's side, trembling, begins the sacred rites of pride. unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here the various off'rings of the world appear; from each she nicely culls with curious toil, and decks the goddess with the glitt'ring spoil. this casket india's glowing gems unlocks, and all arabia breathes from yonder box. the tortoise here and elephant unite, transform'd to combs, the speckled and the white. here files of pins extend their shining rows, puffs, powders, patches, bibles, billet-doux. now awful beauty puts on all its arms; the fair each moment rises in her charms, repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace, and calls forth all the wonders of her face; sees by degrees a purer blush arise, and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes. the busy sylphs surround their darling care; these set the head, and those divide the hair, some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown; and betty's prais'd for labours not her own.

 this old house lodges no ghosts! those swaggering specters who found their way across the atlantic were left behind with their old european grudges in the farmhouses of new england and pennsylvania like so much jettisoned baggage too heavy to lug over the piedmont.  the flatlands are inhospitable to phantoms. here shadows are sharp and arbitrary not mazy, obscure, cowering in corners behind scary old boots in a cupboard or muffled in empty coats, deserted by long-dead cousins (who appear now and then but only in photographs already rusting at the edges)—  setting out in the creaking wagon tight-lipped, alert to move on, the old settlers had no room for illusions. their dangers were real. now in the spare square house their great-grandchildren tidy away the past until the polished surfaces reflect not apparitions, pinched, parched, craving, unsatisfied, but only their own faces.

 twelve o'clock. along the reaches of the street held in a lunar synthesis, whispering lunar incantations dissolve the floors of memory and all its clear relations, its divisions and precisions, every street lamp that i pass beats like a fatalistic drum, and through the spaces of the dark midnight shakes the memory as a madman shakes a dead geranium.  half-past one, the street lamp sputtered, the street lamp muttered, the street lamp said, "regard that woman who hesitates towards you in the light of the door which opens on her like a grin. you see the border of her dress is torn and stained with sand, and you see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin."  the memory throws up high and dry a crowd of twisted things; a twisted branch upon the beach eaten smooth, and polished as if the world gave up the secret of its skeleton, stiff and white. a broken spring in a factory yard, rust that clings to the form that the strength has left hard and curled and ready to snap.  half-past two, the street lamp said, "remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter, slips out its tongue and devours a morsel of rancid butter." so the hand of a child, automatic, slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay. i could see nothing behind that child's eye. i have seen eyes in the street trying to peer through lighted shutters, and a crab one afternoon in a pool, an old crab with barnacles on his back, gripped the end of a stick which i held him.  half-past three, the lamp sputtered, the lamp muttered in the dark.  the lamp hummed: "regard the moon, la lune ne garde aucune rancune, she winks a feeble eye, she smiles into corners. she smoothes the hair of the grass. the moon has lost her memory. a washed-out smallpox cracks her face, her hand twists a paper rose, that smells of dust and old cologne, she is alone with all the old nocturnal smells that cross and cross across her brain." the reminiscence comes of sunless dry geraniums and dust in crevices, smells of chestnuts in the streets, and female smells in shuttered rooms, and cigarettes in corridors and cocktail smells in bars.  the lamp said, "four o'clock, here is the number on the door. memory! you have the key, the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair, mount. the bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall, put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."  the last twist of the knife.

 a town so flat a grave's a hill, a dusk the color of beer. a row of schooldesks shadows fill, a row of houses near.  a courthouse spreading to its lawn, a bank clock's lingering heat. a gleam of storefronts not quite gone, a courthouse in the street.  a different element, almost, a dry creek brimming black. a light to lure the darkness close, a light to keep it back.  a time so still a heart's a sound, a moon the color of skin. a pumpjack bowing to the ground, again, again, again.

 the first time my brother says ain't my mother pulls a branch from the willow tree growing down the hill at the edge of our backyard. as she slips her closed hand over it, removes the leaves, my brother begins to cry because the branch is a switch now  no longer beautifully weeping at the bottom of the hill. it whirs as my mother whips it through the air and down against my brother's legs.  you will never, my mother says, say ain't in this house. you will never say ain't anywhere.  each switching is a warning to us our words are to remain crisp and clear. we are never to say huh? ain't

 i like the story of the circus waif bought by the man-of-weights to be his mistress, profit the demon dragging her to market and lust the soul who paid in lire for her.  i like the peculiarities of her faith, the startling quality of that innocence, kissing the hand that dealt her cruelty believing, poor and dumb, that this was love.  i relish a destitution stripped to sing pure in a voice all passion and denial: such are the driven burning by their breath more than mere air allows and cold permits.  i savor my own involvement and concern lest all the transformations seem unreal, lest love be painted water-sweet and classic rather than salt and anguish to the end.  i like her squatting in the village road combing the dust for something of her own, coming away belonging and committed, roots to be cherished, stones she could befriend.  and what i like the subtlest and profoundest is that the circus traveled grief to grief educating the waif into a woman loving and beautiful and fiercely proud.  i think of the sense of fury in that road, stooping to scratch the earth out for a life somewhere awaiting finding in one’s name. i like that, and i like the word expense.  i think of the years together which they had, the strong-man working her into the act, that hint, despite himself, of some devotion. i like that, and i like the ring of cost.  not in a root, or stone, but in a man she found a thing to hold her tenderness. i like her dedication after that, her saying, if she spoke, i live by this.  and what i like pervasive and forever is that my eyes have wept the tale before, wanting the telling not so much as story but for the way the waif befits my life.

 what i want most is what i deeply fear: loss of self; yet here i stand, a “memsahib,” all decked out in wonder, and still a stranger amid the harvest, old gaffar at my side.  here’s a pandit preaching in the flower stall: he turns funeral wreaths into wheels of rapture. i must shrug off my notion of knowing anything of substance about the world, about the spirit.  sparrows dart between the columns like music. huge pupae, bananas split their golden skins; flies moisten their hands in bands of dew. lepers limp by on crutches, in slow motion.  where is there order in the world? none, none, i think—no order, only spirals of power. the pyramids of onion, guava, melon—all defy my reason: they shine like galaxy-driven planets.  a balancing scale becomes a barge of plenty, a cornucopia endlessly filling up and emptying. the wages of sin are more sin: virtue’s wages, more virtue—and all such earnings, weightless.  i’ve forgotten my errand; i float now through myself like a howl through a phantom mouth— the world’s an illusory marketplace where i must bargain hardest for what i hope i’m worth.

 of course i chose the terry cloth surrogate. milkless artifice. false idol. everyone, i’m told, has a mother,  but master bred me in a laboratory, his colony of orphans. rhesus macaque.macaca mulatta. old world monkeys, my matriarchs ruled the grasslands  and forests long before white men like him weaned their whiteness and maleness from our chromosomes,  slashed and burned our home, what they once called the orient. french indochina. việt nam. master, like a good despot, besotted and dumbstruck, dying  to discern the genesis of allegiance, the science of love and loss, nature versus nurture, segregated me at birth  from my maker, pelt sopping with placental blood. in a chamber where he kept track of me, his pupils recorded my every movement, my every utterance,  hoping i might evince to them a part of themselves. but i wasn’t stupid. i knew famine and emaciation,  and nevertheless i picked that lifeless piece of shit because it was soft to hold. who wouldn’t want that? though it couldn’t hold me, i clung to the yellow-face  devil as though it was my true mother and i grasped the function of motherhood: witness to my suffering,  companion in hell. unlike infants with wire mothers i didn’t hurl myself on the floor in terror or tantrum, rocking back and forth, colder than a corpse. i had  what master believed to be a psychological base of operations. emotional attachment. autonomy.  everything he denied and did to me, his ceaseless cruelty concealed as inquisition, unthinkable until it was thought, i endured by keeping for myself  the wisdom he yearned to discover and take credit for. love, like me, is a beast no master can maim,  no dungeon can discipline. love is at once master and dungeon. so don’t underestimate me. simple- minded and subservient as i might appear to be,  i gathered more about master than he did about me, which, i guess, is a kind of fidelity  conceived not from fondness but fear magnified by fascination. master made me his terry cloth surrogate, his red-clawed god, nursing his id  on my tits, and for that, i pitied him. all this time he was the animal. all this time he belonged to me.

 natchez afternoon burns everything off franklin street. even the birds, even the flies.  or iced-tea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone into a doze, all indoors, in a cool  they said would never come eighty years ago when this was still the center of business  and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs, ice in a highball, and let each house  close its lids a while. they've kept their quiet, so i'm alone before the windows,  the radiant panes, each with its scrim of clay, the finish the river gives everything,  so nothing, not even glass, is clear. it's almost painful, this saturation,  this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags, bright and strange as a magazine photo  you'd find in an attic or an antique store, hard to believe the color was ever real.  the teacups, the painted china and jeweled eggs, even the bottles, medicine vials  and flasks each with its ounce of dirt, even the smell of the prolific earth,  the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs and oak armoires and mantles that survive  their tall, white homes, like the plantation house where, later, i'll witness again  the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt that still feels like a dream, where i'll walk  out of—or is it into?—myself, the maitre'd's small, solicitous voice  proffering another julep—cotton-leaf hand, silver cup—though even he must be  a reenactment or a revenant, a hanger for the clothes of memory.  i will take it, i would, a handful of refuge in unthinking weather, will take  the same lethargic joy in a breeze, any chill in the throat, any kind of shade—  so i enter the dim of one old cotton house, its air-conditioned maze of hand-tools  and quilts, corn cribs and cotton gins, and of course the owner's smile, porcelain, bright, almost  blinding, blooming in welcome and how-you-do and what-brings-you. we talk amid rows  of cook-stoves, stew-pots, and cast-iron skillets about the wedding i've come to see  on the famed estate, the time the town exploded, the rhythm club's inferno, and then  she ventures she knows the accent, knows i'm from alabama, and soon she's eloquent  on our lakes and rivers, where the mister takes her every chance they get. she's seen it all,  so she asks where i'm from, and when i say she starts to glow, gushing over mountains  all the way to gatlinburg. she's walked each one, even skied the state's one slope, which conjures  not the "southern snow" that required almost everything around us, but snow, cold snow, a thought  that cools me further, so my sweat is nearly dry when the smile tightens across her teeth  and she leans in to say ijust love it you know—there are no darkies there.  then afternoon is a conspiracy of color, an echo the heat or the history  in our voices draws us into— someone else's version of ourselves—  and the inevitable, painful quiet in which an answer must arrive.  what can you say? and how long do you have to wait before you can leave, before you can walk  out of yourself and down the cotton-trading streets into the smother of trees  on some more recent lane? how long do you have to wait before you can leave and not be followed,  and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds drown in bass and drum and anger,  before you can cross back into the proper century? the smell of the river stays with you,  maybe even grows as you move so you don't know where you're going, and the key in your hand  could open a car door or a plantation room or nothing at all, some door that's vanished  in the air, june's shimmer from the asphalt and the roofs of every house, so you walk  toward that moment when the sun starts burning and the magnolias' thick perfume washes  all around and you find yourself on a corner, all linen and sweat, again the only one  who'd walk in a heat like this. you have no idea where you are, so you cock your head  as if you might hear your way through the afternoon, and when you raise your head, you see,  across the street, two men hunched in shadow on a barbershop's stoop, ties  dangling like smoke in the solid air. they've seen you and now their brows sharpen  as if they know, too, you're not from here, and in the space between you anything  could pass, the ghosts of farragut or grant or a hot white caddy rattling new orleans bounce,  you're waiting to see, it seems like years or centuries, then one rises, ties his tie, and steps back in,  leaving the other, who keeps your eye a moment longer then looks into the distance  through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air for something far behind you, something  you don't even know how to look for, something that may never arrive.

 in someone’s distant algorithm your mortgage was bundled to another’s —hedged— and stamped a new “security.” while it was swapped from investor to investor accruing fees and interest at each turn, your shadow partner defaulted and she abandoned her home.  someone uses your mortgage to leverage something far inside the starbursts of a server. likewise marriage has no image— what’s a mortgage and who’s it engage on the other side of the firewall?  *  i witnessed a will which—the language invested with law godmothers the peacock’s fanned screech— would take care of the baby in the event of a [blesses herself]  it lives at the cathedral and seems to be some kind of mascot for baptisms  *  securities:  the future art you’ll make and its pleasure is hedged against the boys who died  you fancied.

 we rise from the snow where we’ve lain on our backs and flown like children, from the imprint of perfect wings and cold gowns, and we stagger together wine-breathed into town where our people are building their armies again, short years after body bags, after burnings. there is a man i’ve come to love after thirty, and we have our rituals of coffee, of airports, regret. after love we smoke and sleep with magazines, two shot glasses and the black and white collapse of hours. in what time do we live that it is too late to have children? in what place that we consider the various ways to leave? there is no list long enough for a selective service card shriveling under a match, the prison that comes of it, a flag in the wind eaten from its pole and boys sent back in trash bags. we’ll tell you. you were at that time learning fractions. we’ll tell you about fractions. half of us are dead or quiet or lost. let them speak for themselves. we lie down in the fields and leave behind the corpses of angels.

 a boarded-up house. ransacked inside — broken glass and toppled tables, chairs overturned, books shaken for hidden money.  there are mouths in dreams full of gold teeth, chewing bread and meat. the body is hollow as flame and will burn down anything if pointed straight.  a bird flies in through the door, then flutters at the window. although he is tiny, i am too afraid to help him escape.  i’ve made myself another house. i hum to fill its empty rooms. i fold in like saloon doors closing, then swinging out, keeping out thieves.

 ain’t nothing more beautiful than a french diplomat in an italian suit discussing the intimate ties between poetry and constipation with a united states senator in a discount blazer from the men’s wearhouse bought especially for the occasion of proposing the anti-chimera act, a prime indicator that if children were once the future, they are not the past, which is growing hairier every moment, so as to keep us from penetrating its insides, which we must nibble on as if nibbling on donuts, by which i mean rubrics, glittering rubrics in the dry heat of an empty test bank full of raccoons with flexible snouts and long tails that materialize in the shrubbery as thick-set stocky fraternity brothers suicide bomb colleges full of free thinking mavericks with tuning forks in their ears and rubber dicks in their pockets, a veritable cure for loneliness and its side effects, including the desire to fantasize about mythological genitalia in the pants of pundits who declare that to be alive is fundamentally okay as long as poets test their verses on guinea pigs before submitting them to us humans as we exit the amalgamated marshland of surplus value and enter an ordinary evening on which ordinary people dream of lubricated condoms for dogs, of mules who practice the pull-out method, of birth control pills for cats, of floating trousers that haunt city squares in search of red-walled boutiques where silk stockings and boot-cut chinos fight for the attention of disembodied legs while merchants masturbate, aroused by visions of painless castration, aroused by hands without arms scribbling conjunctions into dusty ceilings, aroused by hands without arms stirring infinite bowls of soup, aroused by module-makers who insist only on the metaphorical value of money as represented in the hieroglyphics painted on the walls of financiers who accumulate capital through the unjustified sexual behavior of adulterous women who appear asymmetrically—legs over heads, hands coming out of butts—in public ceremonies in which syringes suck out erroneous feelings from their bodies while suits and ties stuff bones and ears into decorative bottles and jars.

 the first four leaders had broken knees the four old dams had broken knees the flock would start to run, then freeze the first four leaders had broken knees  ‘why is the flock so docile?’ asked the hawk. ‘yes, why is the flock so docile,’ laughed the dog,  ‘the shepherd’s mallet is in his hand, the shepherd’s hand is on the land, the flock will start to run, then freeze— the four old dams have broken knees,’ the dog explained.  the hawk exclaimed: ‘the shepherd leads an easy life!’  ‘i know, i know,’ cried the shepherd’s wife, ‘he dresses me out in a narrow skirt and leaves me home to clean his dirt. whenever i try to run, i freeze— all the old dams have broken knees.’  ‘well, i’m so glad he doesn’t dare to bring his breaking power to bear on me,’ said the hawk, flying into the sun; while the dog warned, in his dog run: ‘hawk—the shepherd has bought a gun!’  ‘why is the hawk so docile?’ asked the flock,  ‘he fell to the ground in a feathery breeze; he lies in a dumb lump under the trees, we believe we’d rather have broken knees than lose our blood and suddenly freeze like him.’  but the oldest dam gave her leg a lick, and said, ‘some die slow and some die quick, a few run away and the rest crawl, but the shepherd never dies at all— damn his soul.  i’d will my wool to the shepherd’s wife if she could change the shepherd’s life, but i myself would bring him low if only,only i knew how.’

 bedfordshire a blue bird showing off its undercarriage en route between our oldest universities was observed slightly off-course above woburn in the leafy heart of our sleepiest county: two cyclists in tandem looked up at the same moment, like a busy footnote to its asterisk.  berkshire once on the causeway outside steventon i had a vision of living in willing exile, of living the knowingly imperfect life but with a boundless and joyous energy like borodin played by the north berkshire youth orchestra in its early days.  buckinghamshire a goose in the garden of the second-best pub in marsh gibbon was busy doing its dirty toothpaste and noisy, too, when a woman staggered out of the lounge bar into the deserted car-park saying: ‘i could never think of the child at my breast as anything other than a penis with a mouth.’  cambridgeshire the bird arrived. nothing so stately-exciting as handel’s dusky queen that was unspooling perhaps too loudly from a scribbling student cell, but looped between the trees, a flash of green: and only the having chanced to look just there could tell you it had ever been away.  cheshire there was a young woman of cheadle, who wore her heart upon her sleeve, bright chevron! oh, the keen-eyed men of cheadle, as in the jealous month when the registration numbers of new estate cars change all over wealthy suburban cheshire, and they picked out her heart with a needle.  cornwall the very last cat to speak cornish had a glass eye and kept a corner shop, selling shoe-laces and bullseyes, brasso and reckitt’s blue. my great-aunt remembers buying postcards from him as a girl, when george’s profile sped them for a penny. aching to talk, he died of pure loneliness.  cumberland they play bezique in threlkeld and they play for keeps in shap. and all the shapely clouds roll through the streets like weeping chemistry or cows escaped. and tea is served in the lounge over a jig-saw puzzle of the princess elizabeth beneath wet panes, wet mountains and wet sky.  derbyshire once upon a time, in derbyshire’s leaking basement where you lie back in boats and quant by walking the ceiling, a strange girl in the dripping darkness attached her damp lips to mine fast, like a snail’s adherence to cold stone in dusty nettles, and all unseeen the bluejohn slid by me: yellows, greys and purples.  devon you will never forget the fish market at barnstaple: wet gills, double bellies, gleaming scales, shells like spilt treasure. and the cream there thicker than a virgin’s dream, and devon’s greatest poet born gay, on joy street, taught by robert luck: it is the paradise of all fat poets.  dorset when the old woman entered the sea at charmouth and the great waves hung over her head like theatre curtains, i thought of the sibyl who charmed the rocks to yield their grainy secrets till history bore down upon her and the liquid world was fixed for ever in the era of the fossils.  durham at the end of your battered philosophical quest, the purity of durham rises like an exhalation, like the stench of sulphur in a barrel. birds build in the walls of the cloisters, disappearing into holes like black-robed devotees. inside it is quiet, the oatmeal crimping distant in grey air.  essex i had a vision in the dead of night of all the kitchens of commuters’ essex alight like the heads of snakes; and down them slid the bored wives and daughters of the managers who were at the identical time arriving on the ladders of their power and fatigue.  gloucestershire armorial memorials reduced to leper stone, forests to hedges, hedges to sickled stumps where perch the songless birds of gloucestershire, and vans require the roads before them in their headlights. no one speaks in the time it takes to cross the greenest county.  hampshire driving at evening down the a 34 like a ski-run, the sun a deiphany, the car-radio a percussive russian insistence: pure pleasure, pure escape! past winchester, unseen its stalking scholars, past everything, driving through hampshire, driving for the boats!  herefordshire alone between the arrow and the wye, wales to the west, keeping its rain and secrets, i wandered in cider country, where the shade beneath the trees is golden red and noisy with the jealous spite of wasps: ariconium, the poet philips, his long hair combed out!  hertfordshire hertfordshire is full of schoolmasters, and archaeologists who are part-time poets. together they apportion past, present and future among their imaginary admirers in the form of examination papers, foul drafts, and labels of dubious information.  huntingdonshire herds of deer are moving through the trees of huntingdonshire noisily and rather slowly. an idle hand sweeping the lyre brings tears to the eyes of the moderately rich. they will dip their hands in their pockets, gently dip but not too deep. you’ve got to keep money moving.  kent old men coming up to bowl remember other old men who in their turn remembered things that were hardly worth remembering through long still nights in ashford, faversham, sevenoaks and tunbridge wells and westerham where even now the fields still smell of beer.  lancashire all the oven doors of lancashire swing open on the hour, revealing vast puddings. after tea, the lovers stroll, their hands in each other’s back trouser pockets, feeling the strange swell of the flexing buttock. the sun sinks, and the ribble runs to the sea.  leicestershire cheeks of angels, lips compressed, donate to brass invisible impulsions of purely material breath: a county’s children gather to create an overture, while brothers and fathers leaping over hedges wind horns to their alternative conclusion.  lincolnshire m1, m18, m180: the roads with their bright and bowline intersections sweep north to scunthorpe. go further if you will to where the trent meets the humber and lincolnshire ends. there, at alkborough, you may draw breath and if nicky’s at home she will give you a cup of something.  middlesex middlesex is mostly roundabouts, the bright voice of five p.m., insistent infotainment: fingers gallop irritably on the steering-wheel; the nails make little clicks. down the line of fuming stationary volvos boys bully with headlines that tell the drivers all about the place they have come from.  norfolk norfolk is somehow inverted: it’s all sky with clouds as bulky as castrati or lines of dryden sailing out above you, tinged with sunset. get as far as you can, but not too far, say to the tuesday market place at king’s lynn where all the conveyancing is done in verse.  northamptonshire once half-lost here, when only a map of sounds or smells could lead us from a wood, we came at evening to horse-brass and low-timbered beams where the world had evolved to its great public state and the men and women of northampton, being counted and with amber drinks, found themselves to be happy.  northumberland traitors’ county: from one end to the other you can walk bright-eyed with never a second glance from a stocky frowning people who move slowly and mind their own business. for they have seen it all: when the mist clears over northumberland it leaves squat towers, valleys scarred with lead.  nottinghamshire there is one red door in one slightly curved street in one nameless market town that contains behind it for a moment an image of the planet’s destiny: a girl stooping to a hallway mirror, making her lips move into a theatrical kiss, a self kiss.  oxfordshire the kingfisher has long flown. along the cherwell the biscuit of bridge and college wall is blank of its image, but with a passing presence like a photograph taken with an open shutter. this, we reflect, is just the sense of our life, aware of something the very moment that we miss it.  rutland rutland is large enough for you and me to stumble into as into a wood without being seen, to tread its moss-starred carpet, enchanted by the chipped china of the russulas, pink, grey, grey and green-grey, and red, peeping beneath the oaks, not far from oakham.  shropshire shropshire blue, still made, the lord be praised, tart veins that kept the romans here and housman from the rope. the iron bridges lead you to it, farms knee-deep in cow. and if you stop off in red-earthed bridgnorth, that vigilant town, be sure your pint is not ungraced with cheese.  somerset a thousand airy harps! we hardly dare to let out breath, for our imagination responds to these full-throated sounds as though to the ranks of the ever-delighting dead, our wise visionaries, and this is the county of dreams and of the moon’s occult praesidium.  staffordshire staffordshire is where you almost came from, darkened beneath burnt clay, perpetual dusk. it is the housewife’s dream, twinkling hearths bright with zebo, scrubbed pumice steps and, in the bathroom, a finger on the nozzle and little lavender farts to begin the day.  suffolk i’ve had leigh and buried st edmunds, stowed felix and market and upland, i’ve been shut up in boxton, found it painful in akenham and felt totally stupid in assingham: carrying around one’s valuable despair like a fleece, to live in suffolk is to suffocate.  surrey flying in perfect formation above the sleeping cul-de-sacs of surrey, you observe the blocked pairing of houses, each with a garage, like epaulettes. what whisperings behind the party walls! what eavesdropping, and what bad timing! well done! sorry, partner! boom!  sussex chalk pie, a quality of sun like laughter, distance predicted in hoof-beats: everywhere here is vigilance as well as cruel amusement, that tempered island quality called sardonic. from rye to selsey bill, something is on offer, a glittering spread, the bottom drawer pulled out.  warwickshire driving to wales i crossed a corner of warwickshire that seemed to be hardly space at all, the home of dr hall and his famous father-in-law or of magic woods where lovers were lost and found, but simply the minutes that it took to tell an unimportant story, now forgotten.  westmorland once again the skies are open over the whole county: from clifton to burton, from grasmere to brough, the pubtalk steaming with anoraks and orange parkas. but i can remember one solitary eye raging in silence in the dripping marsh, its dewy lashes spooning aphids from the air.  wiltshire in wiltshire they are sending extra-terrestrial signals: what will the venusians think of us? four-footed creatures who like to move in circles? let’s hope they never noisily discover that we are only half the men they thought us, stumbling at tangents from our glimpsed perfection.  worcestershire oh darling, come to broadway: there we’ll take tea and scones and jam made from the plums of pershore, perfect, pitless, palate-pleasing. a stroll in the model street, a browse at gavina’s. then it’s right foot down in the volvo, plenty of scotch and the largest bed we can find at the bull in worcester.  yorkshire the brown teapot is always warming here for there will be a time when you must come home though you be unknown except to the flowered dead. on the moors the diagonal smoke rises like a bitter smile, tight but welcoming: cousin country, extra places for tea.

 in the sweet shire of cardigan, not far from pleasant ivor-hall, an old man dwells, a little man,— 'tis said he once was tall. for five-and-thirty years he lived a running huntsman merry; and still the centre of his cheek is red as a ripe cherry.  no man like him the horn could sound, and hill and valley rang with glee when echo bandied, round and round the halloo of simon lee. in those proud days, he little cared for husbandry or tillage; to blither tasks did simon rouse the sleepers of the village.  he all the country could outrun, could leave both man and horse behind; and often, ere the chase was done, he reeled, and was stone-blind. and still there's something in the world at which his heart rejoices; for when the chiming hounds are out, he dearly loves their voices!  but, oh the heavy change!—bereft of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see! old simon to the world is left in liveried poverty. his master's dead—and no one now dwells in the hall of ivor; men, dogs, and horses, all are dead; he is the sole survivor.  and he is lean and he is sick; his body, dwindled and awry, rests upon ankles swoln and thick; his legs are thin and dry. one prop he has, and only one, his wife, an aged woman, lives with him, near the waterfall, upon the village common.  beside their moss-grown hut of clay, not twenty paces from the door, a scrap of land they have, but they are poorest of the poor. this scrap of land he from the heath enclosed when he was stronger; but what to them avails the land which he can till no longer?  oft, working by her husband's side, ruth does what simon cannot do; for she, with scanty cause for pride, is stouter of the two. and, though you with your utmost skill from labour could not wean them, 'tis little, very little—all that they can do between them.  few months of life has he in store as he to you will tell, for still, the more he works, the more do his weak ankles swell. my gentle reader, i perceive, how patiently you've waited, and now i fear that you expect some tale will be related.  o reader! had you in your mind such stores as silent thought can bring, o gentle reader! you would find a tale in every thing. what more i have to say is short, and you must kindly take it: it is no tale; but, should you think, perhaps a tale you'll make it.  one summer-day i chanced to see this old man doing all he could to unearth the root of an old tree, a stump of rotten wood. the mattock tottered in his hand; so vain was his endeavour, that at the root of the old tree he might have worked for ever.  "you're overtasked, good simon lee, give me your tool," to him i said; and at the word right gladly he received my proffered aid. i struck, and with a single blow the tangled root i severed, at which the poor old man so long and vainly had endeavoured.  the tears into his eyes were brought, and thanks and praises seemed to run so fast out of his heart, i thought they never would have done. —i've heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds with coldness still returning; alas! the gratitude of men hath oftener left me mourning.

 for ethan canin i sat on the dock at dusk and spoke to the fish who swam beneath me like ears with fins to hear my secrets. “that words come close?” i whispered. “the sky enters me like a sword with my own hand on the hilt. how to witness what i can't express— the smell of lilacs, the dirge of loons. make up the rest if you wish. less is enough. say i sound like one of the hosts. that i'm crying also and there's nothing you can do to make me stop. that i'm like the peepers, katydids, and thrush with my own song— all call in the opera of dusk. or is it response?”

 southward with fleet of ice sailed the corsair death; wild and gast blew the blast, and the east-wind was his breath.  his lordly ships of ice glisten in the sun; on each side, like pennons wide, flashing crystal streamlets run.  his sails of white sea-mist dripped with silver rain; but where he passed there were cast leaden shadows o'er the main.  eastward from campobello sir humphrey gilbert sailed; three days or more seaward he bore, then, alas! the land-wind failed.  alas! the land-wind failed, and ice-cold grew the night; and nevermore, on sea or shore, should sir humphrey see the light.  he sat upon the deck, the book was in his hand; "do not fear! heaven is as near," he said, "by water as by land!"  in the first watch of the night, without a signal's sound, out of the sea, mysteriously, the fleet of death rose all around.  the moon and the evening star were hanging in the shrouds; every mast, as it passed, seemed to rake the passing clouds.  they grappled with their prize, at midnight black and cold! as of a rock was the shock; heavily the ground-swell rolled.  southward through day and dark, they drift in cold embrace, with mist and rain, o'er the open main; yet there seems no change of place.  southward, forever southward, they drift through dark and day; and like a dream, in the gulf-stream sinking, vanish all away.

 of all the rides since the birth of time, told in story or sung in rhyme, — on apuleius’s golden ass, or one-eyed calender’s horse of brass, witch astride of a human back, islam’s prophet on al-borák, — the strangest ride that ever was sped was ireson’s, out from marblehead! old floyd ireson, for his hard heart, tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of marblehead!  body of turkey, head of owl, wings a-droop like a rained-on fowl, feathered and ruffled in every part, skipper ireson stood in the cart. scores of women, old and young, strong of muscle, and glib of tongue, pushed and pulled up the rocky lane, shouting and singing the shrill refrain: “here ’s flud oirson, fur his horrd horrt, torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt by the women o’ morble’ead!”  wrinkled scolds with hands on hips, girls in bloom of cheek and lips, wild-eyed, free-limbed, such as chase bacchus round some antique vase, brief of skirt, with ankles bare, loose of kerchief and loose of hair, with conch-shells blowing and fish-horns’ twang, over and over the mænads sang: “here ’s flud oirson, fur his horrd horrt, torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt by the women o’ morble’ead!”  small pity for him! — he sailed away from a leaking ship in chaleur bay, — sailed away from a sinking wreck, with his own town’s-people on her deck! “lay by! lay by!” they called to him. back he answered, “sink or swim! brag of your catch of fish again!” and off he sailed through the fog and rain! old floyd ireson, for his hard heart, tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of marblehead!  fathoms deep in dark chaleur that wreck shall lie forevermore. mother and sister, wife and maid, looked from the rocks of marblehead over the moaning and rainy sea, — looked for the coming that might not be! what did the winds and the sea-birds say of the cruel captain who sailed away? — old floyd ireson, for his hard heart, tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of marblehead!  through the street, on either side, up flew windows, doors swung wide; sharp-tongued spinsters, old wives gray, treble lent the fish-horn’s bray. sea-worn grandsires, cripple-bound, hulks of old sailors run aground, shook head, and fist, and hat, and cane, and cracked with curses the hoarse refrain: “here’s flud oirson, fur his horrd horrt, torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt by the women o’ morble’ead!”  sweetly along the salem road bloom of orchard and lilac showed. little the wicked skipper knew of the fields so green and the sky so blue. riding there in his sorry trim, like an indian idol glum and grim, scarcely he seemed the sound to hear of voices shouting, far and near: “here’s flud oirson, fur his horrd horrt, torr’d an’ futherr’d an’ corr’d in a corrt by the women o’ morble’ead!”  “hear me, neighbors!” at last he cried, — “what to me is this noisy ride? what is the shame that clothes the skin to the nameless horror that lives within? waking or sleeping, i see a wreck, and hear a cry from a reeling deck! hate me and curse me, — i only dread the hand of god and the face of the dead!” said old floyd ireson, for his hard heart, tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of marblehead!  then the wife of the skipper lost at sea said, “god has touched him! why should we!” said an old wife mourning her only son, “cut the rogue’s tether and let him run!” so with soft relentings and rude excuse, half scorn, half pity, they cut him loose, and gave him a cloak to hide him in, and left him alone with his shame and sin. poor floyd ireson, for his hard heart, tarred and feathered and carried in a cart by the women of marblehead!

 wise emblem of our politic world, sage snail, within thine own self curl’d; instruct me softly to make haste, whilst these my feet go slowly fast.  compendious snail! thou seem’st to me, large euclid’s strict epitome; and in each diagram dost fling thee from the point unto the ring; a figure now triangular, an oval now, and now a square; and then a serpentine dost crawl, now a straight line, now crook’d, now all.  preventing rival of the day, th’art up and openest thy ray, and ere the morn cradles the moon th’art broke into a beauteous noon. then when the sun sups in the deep, thy silver horns ere cynthia’s peep; and thou from thine own liquid bed new phoebus heav’st thy pleasant head.  who shall a name for thee create, deep riddle of mysterious state? bold nature that gives common birth to all products of seas and earth, of thee, as earthquakes, is afraid, nor will thy dire deliv’ry aid.  thou thine own daughter then, and sire, that son and mother art entire, that big still with thy self dost go, and liv’st an aged embryo; that like the cubs of india, thou from thyself a while dost play; but frighted with a dog or gun, in thine own belly thou dost run, and as thy house was thine own womb, so thine own womb concludes thy tomb.  but now i must (analyz’d king) thy economic virtues sing; thou great stay’d husband still within, thou, thee, that’s thine dost discipline; and when thou art to progress bent, thou mov’st thy self and tenement, as warlike scythians travell’d, you remove your men and city too; then after a sad dearth and rain, thou scatterest thy silver train; and when the trees grow nak’d and old, thou clothest them with cloth of gold, which from thy bowels thou dost spin, and draw from the rich mines within.  now hast thou chang’d thee saint; and made thy self a fane that’s cupola’d; and in thy wreathed cloister thou walkest thine own grey friar too; strict, and lock’d up, th’art hood all o’er, and ne’er eliminat’st thy door. on salads thou dost feed severe, and ’stead of beads thou dropp’st a tear; and when to rest, each calls the bell, thou sleep’st within thy marble cell, where in dark contemplation plac’d, the sweets of nature thou dost taste; who now with time thy days resolve, and in a jelly thee dissolve, like a shot star, which doth repair upward, and rarify the air.

 they have left behind the established cave with its well-worn floor. scholarship impels them in hundreds, but generally one by one, to find an unknown passage or scrape out their own. proto-semitic linguistic theory, hittite stratigraphic anomalies, microclimatic economics. "what do you see?" invisible followers ask in their ears, and they whisper "wonderful things" as they quarry a grain of rock at a time, or examine a fleck of ore, or measure the acidity of a trickle of water. see! behold! look! lo! they cry in season, rapt, in love, chipping away with their pocketknives, pencils, rulers, fingernails, but some have tunneled so narrowly and deep that those behind see nothing but slivers of light around an excavator's haunches.  a battered piece of a tablet is all that remains of the so-called singer of nab. circa 1200 bce, he impressed, or had impressed, some words in clay. he may have composed a religious hymn, praise to the king, a poem of love, an inventory of cattle. (he may have been she, but this is unlikely.) the lines we have could be the beginning or the middle; there may have been ten more, or hundreds. the word before this gap, in fact, means "hundreds." hundreds led in battle, hundreds slain? a thousand times beloved, nine hundred sheep? and the standard translation of this word, here, is either "desire" or "need." but did he write of a boundless yearning, or mercantile requirements? was he a "singer"? the scholars who care disagree.  look at them, crouched in a long tunnel dug by means of argument over an antique syntax, warming their hands at a chunk of brick baked maybe in the time of the trojan war, broken some moment between then and now— peering at it with penlights, squandering eyesight. they know they may crawl out hungry, mumbling, aged and gray, clutching a secret message of small import or nothing, nothing. they seem lost. they seem happy.

 afterward, to tell how it was possible to identify absolute space, a matter of great difficulty, keeping in mind always that not all old music is beautiful and therefore it’s necessary to choose. ice loading and unloading as the ice caps wax and wither. brutal and uncouth from the beginning even unto time, space, place, motion.  how are we to obtain true motion? i predict a fiasco—and a fiasco with catcalls. wind circulation in the case of plants, predators in the case of animals, affecting their distribution on the ancient land masses. and who will conduct the chorus and orchestra? many things exist at once.  predilection and preference. begin with the storm. a very agile, beautiful voice. with tremendous temperament. the earth’s magnetic field weakening. even the princess is drawn into the violence of the action, extremes of joy, mad ravings, almost requiring the conventions of opera. thus, thus; we parted, thus to meet again.  thus in a ship, under sail, since the sun itself is moving, supposing infinite space to be (as it were) sensorium of the omnipresent. reduced to a few feet of ground, we begin with great delight to plant a garden. the czar is in that garden. quiet eruptions, safe enough to attract tourists. we suppose other bodies annihilated.  upon any conditions supposed, taught to describe accurately, i detest everything that smells of theory. if we look at similar coral reefs, the past location of the same precise environment can be traced. but there the comparison breaks. and from these relative motions will arise the relative motion of a body on the earth.

 it seems to head from its last stop too fast, my transbay train’s strung-out hoo, deep inside the tunnel, and starts to bleed into the baritone wail of that guy at platform’s end, a sort of lullaby rubbed against the wall then caught in a squall of wind darkening toward us, his whippy voice skinning its tired song off the tiled dome: he’s determined, the silky lyric says, to be independently blue, while we all wait to be chuted to car lot or home, closer to love, or farther, and sooner to loss, our bashful shoes and arms like lives crossed, every plural presence now some thing alone, thanks to our singer-man. we wait for the train, patient with hope, a hope that’s like complaint.

 i am watching the movie twelve angry men because there is a character in it who reminds me of him.  he is the one who wants to go to the baseball game instead of decide on a man’s life, he is the weak one, the one afraid to reveal what he really feels, the one for whom everything is a joke. he is not henry fonda, the tight-lipped moral one.  the man is despicable, his weaknesses obvious to all, as obvious as henry fonda’s goodness. i watch the movie again and again, loving the black and white of it, soothed by the sound of my father’s voice, the careless pronunciation, the easy shrugging of the shoulders at every crucial question.  i sink lower into the dark arms of the sofa. strange how comfortable the familiar is, how we can even prefer it, however terrifying.

 you watch the night like a material slowly being crammed into a tube of rooms; it showers into gunshot, pepper, dew, as if a hand had squeezed it at one end, is blank as innocence when daylight comes projecting sunlit patches on the wall that fade. too much is going on, too much of life, you say, for you to live alone on top of an old tenement, on a train that might start off sometime, but never does. your view is gone. turn around, and boom!, a park appears between two fixed ideas whose narrow aperture of sky in time will house the slums of 1989 . . .  now new york is feigning its gray dark london winter. invisible uptown is out there somewhere, raining on its own. palmed in the dusty pane, a circle bares a scene that seems reprinted from the past: a man with a dog is walking very fast along a path among the stunted trees of the little square below. he disappears.

 i wanted to have a poem and i was pregnant. i was very thin. as if i’d lived on air. a poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. my mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. they were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. my husband wanted me to give dinner parties. john f. kennedy was running for office.  i sensed danger. kennedy wasn’t against the bomb or for nuclear disarmament. i joined sane at its inception. also concerned scientists. i spoke with linus pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize physicians for social responsibility.  there was a baby in my belly. i wanted to write poems. i had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. i hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. i couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though i could see it in isla negra when i followed pablo neruda. i could see it in the way he walked. even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. in his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. pablo neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man.  i was a woman and entitled to nothing. i had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the new york times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.  i would have called pablo long distance if i had the courage, if i had the ability to speak spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. but, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? and what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?  i woke up one morning and thought–i can’t have this child. my husband said, “you’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. you’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” i thought, i can’t. i have to write poems. my mother found a crib. someone painted it white. a friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. i thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.  pablo was silent. he was walking so far from me, i couldn’t hear him. my husband objected to donating more free medical care to the black panthers. i tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the boys’ market twenty miles away. i organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge jfk. my husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. the new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. the u.s. was pursuing over ground testing; i was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. i had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. the fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. i became afraid to have a daughter.  i called pablo neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by isla negra. he moved like a dream porpoise. he seemed pregnant with words. they came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. the sea creatures quivered with joy. i said, “pablo, i want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and i want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” he was large as a whale. he drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. i said, “i can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.  so i packed my little bag as if i were going to the hospital and i left a note and the wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an american indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “you’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” i took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly ibm electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and i went out.  i knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and i would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. i would have enough milk for both. i would learn how to walk with them. but i didn’t know, and i didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of wearever pots.

 i judge my soul eagle nor mole: a man is what he saves from rot.  the corn will fat a hog or rat: are these dry bones a hut’s or throne’s?  who filled the moat ’twixt sheep and goat? let death, the twin of life, slip in?  prophets arise, mask-hid, unwise, divide the earth by class and birth.  caesars without, the people shall rout; caesars within, crush flat as tin.  who makes a noose envies the goose. who digs a pit dices for it.  shall tears be shed for those whose bread is thieved headlong? tears right no wrong.  prophets shall teach the meek to reach. leave not to god the boot and rod.  the straight lines curve? failure of nerve? blind-spots assail? times have their braille.  if hue of skin trademark a sin, blame not the make for god's mistake.  since flesh and bone turn dust and stone, with life so brief, why add to grief?  i sift the chaff from wheat and laugh. no curse can stop the tick of clock.  those who wall in themselves and grin commit incest and spawn a pest.  what’s writ in vice is writ in ice. the truth is not of fruits that rot.  a sponge, the mind soaks in the kind of stuff that fate’s milieu dictates.  jesus, mozart, shakespeare, descartes, lenin, chladni, have lodged with me.  i snatch from hooks the meat of books. i seek frontiers, not worlds on biers.  the snake entoils the pig with coils. the pig’s skewed wail does not prevail.  old men grow worse with prayer or curse: their staffs thwack youth starved thin for truth.  today the few yield poets their due; tomorrow the mass judgment shall pass.  i harbor one fear if death crouch near: does my creed span the gulf of man?  and when i go in calm or blow from mice and men, selah! what . . . then?

 i sing of morrisville (if you call this cry a song). i (if you call this painful  voice by that great name) sing the poverty of my region and of the wrong end of morrisville.  you summer people will say that all its ends are wrong, but there, right there, the very end of the wrong end—  a house with windows sagging, leaning roadward as in defense or maybe defiance next to the granite ledge,  our cliff of broken stone that shoulders our dilapidated one-lane iron bridge. who lives here? i don’t know.  but they (hermes reward them) made this extraordinary garden, geraniums, petunias and nasturtiums  planted in every crevice and all the footholds of the cliff. and then they painted the cliff-face,  painted the old stone; no design, just swatches of color, bold rough splashes irregularly, garish orange  and livid blue. is it fluorescent, do these stones glow in the dark? maybe. i only know  they glow in the day, so vivid i stopped my car, whereupon two others came inquiring also, two  crows in the broken spars of the white pine tree, cawing above the house. why had those who inhabited  this corner of poverty painted the stones? was it that the flowers in living bravery nevertheless  made too meager a show for the ruined cliff? or did they think to bring art to nature, somehow to improve  this corner of ugliness? for my part i thought how these colors were beautiful and yet strange  in their beauty, ugly colors, garish orange, livid blue; they reminded me of those spanish cemeteries  i saw in new mexico, tin mirrors and plastic flowers in the desert. then i knew why the stones  had been painted: to make reparation, such as the poor might make, whose sorrow had been done here, this  desecration. is not this the burden of all poor lands everywhere, the basis of poverty?  a spoiled land makes spoiled people. the poor know this. i guess the crows know too, because off  they flew, cawing above the bridge and the slashed hills surrounding morrisville. i started my car and drove  out on the iron bridge which rumbled its sullen affirmation. and i sang as i sing now  (if you care to call it song) my people of morrisville who live where all the ends are wrong.

 my heart be brave, and do not falter so, nor utter more that deep, despairing wail. thy way is very dark and drear i know, but do not let thy strength and courage fail; for certain as the raven-winged night is followed by the bright and blushing morn, thy coming morrow will be clear and bright; ’tis darkest when the night is furthest worn. look up, and out, beyond, surrounding clouds, and do not in thine own gross darkness grope, rise up, and casting off thy hind’ring shrouds, cling thou to this, and ever inspiring hope: tho’ thick the battle and tho’ fierce the fight, there is a power making for the right.

 let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast, whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars, unlook'd for joy in that i honour most. great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun's eye, and in themselves their pride lies buried, for at a frown they in their glory die. the painful warrior famoused for fight, after a thousand victories once foil'd, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd: then happy i, that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed.

 they that have power to hurt and will do none, that do not do the thing they most do show, who, moving others, are themselves as stone, unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow: they rightly do inherit heaven's graces and husband nature's riches from expense; they are the lords and owners of their faces, others but stewards of their excellence. the summer's flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die, but if that flower with base infection meet, the basest weed outbraves his dignity: for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds; lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.

 i wanted the gold, and i sought it; i scrabbled and mucked like a slave. was it famine or scurvy — i fought it; i hurled my youth into a grave. i wanted the gold, and i got it —  came out with a fortune last fall, —  yet somehow life’s not what i thought it, and somehow the gold isn’t all.  no! there’s the land. (have you seen it?) it’s the cussedest land that i know, from the big, dizzy mountains that screen it to the deep, deathlike valleys below. some say god was tired when he made it; some say it’s a fine land to shun; maybe; but there’s some as would trade it for no land on earth — and i’m one.  you come to get rich (damned good reason); you feel like an exile at first; you hate it like hell for a season, and then you are worse than the worst. it grips you like some kinds of sinning; it twists you from foe to a friend; it seems it’s been since the beginning; it seems it will be to the end.  i’ve stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow that’s plumb-full of hush to the brim; i’ve watched the big, husky sun wallow in crimson and gold, and grow dim, till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming, and the stars tumbled out, neck and crop; and i’ve thought that i surely was dreaming, with the peace o’ the world piled on top.  the summer — no sweeter was ever; the sunshiny woods all athrill; the grayling aleap in the river, the bighorn asleep on the hill. the strong life that never knows harness; the wilds where the caribou call; the freshness, the freedom, the farness —  o god! how i’m stuck on it all.  the winter! the brightness that blinds you, the white land locked tight as a drum, the cold fear that follows and finds you, the silence that bludgeons you dumb. the snows that are older than history, the woods where the weird shadows slant; the stillness, the moonlight, the mystery, i’ve bade ’em good-by — but i can’t.  there’s a land where the mountains are nameless, and the rivers all run god knows where; there are lives that are erring and aimless, and deaths that just hang by a hair; there are hardships that nobody reckons; there are valleys unpeopled and still; there’s a land — oh, it beckons and beckons, and i want to go back — and i will.  they’re making my money diminish; i’m sick of the taste of champagne. thank god! when i’m skinned to a finish i’ll pike to the yukon again. i’ll fight — and you bet it’s no sham-fight; it’s hell! — but i’ve been there before; and it’s better than this by a damsite —  so me for the yukon once more.  there’s gold, and it’s haunting and haunting; it’s luring me on as of old; yet it isn’t the gold that i’m wanting so much as just finding the gold. it’s the great, big, broad land ’way up yonder, it’s the forests where silence has lease; it’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder, it’s the stillness that fills me with peace.

 all winter long you listened for the boom of distant cannon wheeled into their place. sometimes outside beneath a bombers’ moon you stood alone to watch the searchlights trace  their careful webs against the boding sky, while miles away on munich’s vacant square the bombs lunged down with an unruly cry whose blast you saw yet could but faintly hear.  and might have turned your eyes upon the gleam of a thousand years of snow, where near the clouds the alps ride massive to their full extreme, and season after season glacier crowds  the dark, persistent smudge of conifers. or seen beyond the hedge and through the trees the shadowy forms of cattle on the furze, their dim coats white with mist against the freeze.  or thought instead of other times than these, of other countries and of other sights: eternal venice sinking by degrees into the very water that she lights;  reflected in canals, the lucid dome of maria della salute at your feet, her triple spires disfigured by the foam. remembered in berlin the parks, the neat  footpaths and lawns, the clean spring foliage, where just short weeks before, a bomb, unaimed, released a frightened lion from its cage, which in the mottled dark that trees enflamed  killed one who hurried homeward from the raid. and by yourself there standing in the chill you must, with so much known, have been afraid and chosen such a mind of constant will,  which, though all time corrode with constant hurt, remains, until it occupies no space, that which it is; and passionless, inert, becomes at last no meaning and no place.

 think of the woman who first touched fire to a hollow stone filled with seal oil, how she fiddled with fuel and flame until blue shadows before and after her filled her house, crowded the underground, then fled like sky-captains chasing the aurora’s whale tale green beyond the earth’s curve. her tenth summer, the elders let her raise her issum, seal pup orphaned when hunters brought in her mother, their grins of plenty broad, red. the women slit the hard belly. plopped among the ruby innards steaming on rough-cut planks blinked a new sea-child whose first sound came out a question in the old language, a question that in one throaty bark asked who, meaning what family is this? what comfort do you provide for guests? do you let strangers remain strangers? the women rinsed the slick pup in cool water, crafted a pouch for her to suck. then the young girl whose hands held light even when the room did not brought this new being beside her bed, let it scatter babiche and split birch gathered for snowshoes, let it nose the caribou neck hairs bearding her dance fans. they held up the fans to their foreheads, playing white hair, playing old. in the time when women do not sew the seal danced at her first potlatch. and when the lamps burned down, no one could see any difference between waves in rock, waves in sea. the pup lifted her nose, licked salt from seven stars, and slipped light back among silvers and chum light among the ghostly belugas swimming far north to offer themselves.

 at 14th street and first avenue is a bank and in the bank the sexiest teller of all time next to her the greatest thing about today is today itself through which i go up to buy books  they float by under a bluer sky the girls uptown quiet, pampered the sum of all that's terrible in women and much of the best  and the old men go by holding small packages in a trance so rich even they can't believe it  i think it's a red, white, and blue letter day for them too you see, con ed's smokestacks are beautiful the way queens is and horses: from a pleasant distance  or a fleet of turkeys stuffed in a spotless window in two days they'll be sweating in ovens thinking, "how did i ever get in a fix like this?"  light pouring over buildings far away  up here when someone shouts "hey!" in the street you know that they aren't going to kill you they're yelling to a friend of theirs named hey john david hey, perhaps  and the garbage goes out in big white billowy plastic bags tied at the top and even the people go out in them some are waiting now at the bus stop (for a nonexistent bus) and i thought it was garbage! it's so pretty!  if you're classless or modern you can have fun by walking into a high-class antique store so the stately old snob at the desk will ask in eternity "you're going where?" you get to answer, "up."  i like these old pricks if you have an extra hair in the breeze their eyes pop out and then recede way back as if to say, "that person is on . . . dope!" they're very correct  but they're not in my shoes in front of a dubuffet a circus that shines through a window in a bright all-yellow building the window is my eye and frank o'hara is the building i'm thinking about him like mad today (as anyone familiar with his poetry will tell) and about the way madison avenue really does go to heaven and turns around and comes back, disappointed  because up here you can look down on the janitor or pity him  and rent a cloud-colored bentley and architecture's so wonderful! why don't i notice it more often? and the young girls and boys but especially the young girls are drifting away from school in blue and white wool wrapped in fur  are they french? they're speaking french! and they aren't looking for things to throw skirts sliding up the legs of girls who can't keep from grinning under beautiful soft brown american eyes at the whole world which includes their plain jane girlfriends she even smiled at me! i have about as much chance of fucking her as the girl at the bank but i stride along, a terrifying god raunchy a little one-day-old beard and good grief i really did forget to brush my teeth this morning they're turning red with embarrassment or is that blood i've been drinking—i ordered a black coffee miss  and then a black policeman comes in unbuttoning his uniform at the warmish soda fountain while i pull the fleece over my teeth and stare innocently at the books i've bought one a book with a drawing by apollinaire called les fraises au mexique strawberries in mexico but when i open the book to that page it's just a very blue sky i'm looking at

 methought a sweet sound from the street uprose,— and as i pause, and strive again to hear, ‘st patrick’s day’ draws softly to its close, and ‘jordan’s’ waves flow sweetly to my ear, what though from humble source the chorus floats? music is music, and i listen still; i have ‘an ear’, — ay,two! — even jews-harp notes pass current with me, hear them where i will, a slight italian boy, with jetty hair shading dark eyes, grinds out the melody, pulverized music! — in his garb and air i read of sunnier lands beyond the sea, and, dreaming, wander to a fairer clime, recalled, too suddenly, by — ‘if you please, a dime!’

 one died, and the soul was wrenched out of the other in life, who, walking the streets wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on the same corners, volumetrics, shadows under trees. farther than anyone was ever called, through increasingly suburban airs and ways, with autumn falling over everything: the plush leaves the chattels in barrels of an obscure family being evicted into the way it was, and is. the other beached glimpses of what the other was up to: revelations at last. so they grew to hate and forget each other.  so i cradle this average violin that knows only forgotten showtunes, but argues the possibility of free declamation anchored to a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself in november, with the spaces among the days more literal, the meat more visible on the bone. our question of a place of origin hangs like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests, in coves with the water always seeping up, and left our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared on the landscape, to make of us what we could.

 ultimately improved by it: slant light hitting his prison obliquely  near the state bird’s pointed head accentuated crest, the black-ringed bill  from which wheat-wheat-wheat-wheat  from which whoit cheer , whoit cheer ; cheer - cheer-cheer   inspired ronald cotton to listen as in his head, the solitary cardinal indulged in snails  which seemed like polished fossils of trophy hog tails (after prize butchery)  that ronald was able to recall, his hair a mess of replicas of them  as industrious as the state whose success was poultry &amp; eggs tobacco &amp; soybeans  as well as convictions:  none as tightly knit as jennifer’s (not even the state flag) that she could identify cotton  that cotton’s taking on appearances other than burst white of a dense localized haze from which to weave memory, following pink-petaled start, rather a satellite dish of a flower, pollen/sensor- studded antenna protruding from the center  undeniably; the jury couldn’t acquit cotton of its role in documenting and altering jennifer’s history,  many lives changed  as result of consequences, sensors that boast duality of receptor and transmitter: witness: insects give and take, taint what is put out, taken in; mix  it up so that interrelatedness spreads and the understandable error of metaphor becomes less erroneous over time: eleven years in prison, innocence locked up, protected  although in prison, it resembled something else. if cotton strained, he could see the top  of a ferris wheel on the horizon just a possible segment of a rainbow the length of a chain  of cardinal feathers  even though it wasn’t that at all. the eye witnesses all the time, even the unseeing eye is turned toward a focus on black, saturation dense as conviction; the eye  processes, pulls in whole vista to a retinal speck of convergence  which is to say there is some cotton in poole, some connection, independent shared participation in cold beer, occasional cards turkey-spread in the right hand without knowing the other sank into the seat at the cinema the same way  and sampled funnel cake at the state fair within a week of each other  and more than that in common: both being men and convicted for what men really can and really do, do.  including sometimes confessions and apologies; cash reparations  after the innocence is free to extend its parameters to unlocked doors, be an oversized over-zealous white bird floating down the aisle, its cottony haze lifted in order to kiss and marry ronald’s calm delight in being able to take his time  leave his longshoreman’s mark on ships that take some of him to any port in the world: durable goods  such as the dna whose precision detects human exactitude, and could build as many ronalds as time would permit  something jennifer now desperately wants to do, restoring what was lost because it was like something else,  because the fact of similarity is compelling, convincing; if connections could not be made, there’d be no havens, no fugitive status lost to fusion, no links to god, no human  murmurings whose constant echoes are also the gentle silvery hum of fans praying over computer motors to cool them and also mimic motion of small wings amplified to make sound  in the distance much like the electric razor preparing a head on death row clean as a light bulb.   ronald was prepared to be believed; he saw the quiet manner of his long days in court as evidence of his rationality and contemplativeness  such as befits clergy; a potential propensity for order, mercy, the steadiness required to dispense blessings mostly on the undeserving without emotion or judgment selfishness or preference  while he was being judged guilty for lack of emotion, for jennifer’s incontrovertible emotional insistence on cotton’s being the one—she had to finger him to be comfortable within her survival. no way to mistake to ever forget details documented in memory, the event relived to the point that it resculpted her brain into a cottony bust (he was there to be the perfect model)  whose reality floated away in a poole, as only the reflection of cotton  identified as source. a situation also called (must-have) moonlight.   here’s the new &amp; improved cotton: eleven years in the making; enough time served to anger to ruin it; at that same room’s temperature it became doubt of clemency, pardon: peculiar butter that erupted as gratefulness for the miracle of absolute exoneration when his impossibility as rapist was proven.  even cotton conceded that the composite sketch bore a just resemblance to cotton, displayed a metaphor for men like cotton, the seeds of capability in the structure of the face, the human repertoire that includes cotton who softly consents to meet jennifer when she asks him to funnel her regret and apologies deep into himself, accepting that she meant no malice toward him but toward the perpetrator whom many men resemble, all brothers, family  of man resemblance; cotton’s own daughter, cotton’s own wife could be in a similar position; no offense taken, captivated by the beauty of jennifer; her superior logic  refusing to let the crime against her silence her; as sure, as certain, as dazzling about speaking up about mistaking cotton for poole as she was in identifying in the lineup the closest thing there to poole the best available, the incredible likeness that memory seized, filling gaps in the recollected poole with cotton’s particulars. she felt better in her cotton- touched skin.  metaphor is a form of forgiveness; a short rope of it knots-up those that can’t come together any other way into being defined by the other. strange  and estranged pairings give rise to mutable truth that can yield to both dawn and twilight demands that things be seen differently.   jennifer in moonlight instead of being illuminated moon whose face was also in emmett till’s way, but this generation of jennifer has another side home late after a day of good faith in which she and cotton team up at a church to speak up about doubt as less a shadow than certainty.  memory is as accurate as metaphor, an overlay that always fits something, that like the purest most sparkling water is too naïve not to submit to any vessel into which it’s poured. just to be guzzled.  perhaps the vessel in which cotton becomes a pool in which north carolina is shaped like an embryo:  humanity still on the brink of infancy.

 on “sueño no. 5: botella del mar,” a photograph by grete stern (1950) the woman sits clutching her knees inside a short-necked bottle on a beach, looks up smiling at a mouth above all imagined itineraries. we like to think she volunteered to be lowered into the bottle. on her own idea, even her own craftiness, lured into being enrobed with the thick glass that is the gray-blue of a ukiyo-e sky of flying cranes who breathe the steam of that bluish gray ideation and end of autumn, or a plume of smoke from a train in the middle distance.  swells of warm seawater push wet sand against spun tips of seashells that sit on the warmed strand like nobility on a plush settee. the bottle’s bottom edge lists in the hot sand, the heat of the morning sunlight penetrates the bottle walls, and foam and breeze coax a juddering creature from underneath. from inside the woman argues with herself that the horizon is another of the world’s ambitions.  those ships slipped into bottles with volition and self-responsibility, acquiesce so marvelously, like the glass fitting so smoothly around her. she is a person born to be put into this and admired as perfection from the outside, which is how we love flowers and dreams, though our desires may suffocate them.

 far down, down through the city’s great gaunt gut the gray train rushing bears the weary wind; in the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut, leaving the sick and heavy air behind. and pale-cheeked children seek the upper door to give their summer jackets to the breeze; their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar of captive wind that moans for fields and seas; seas cooling warm where native schooners drift through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep, waiting for windy waves the keels to lift lightly among the islands of the deep; islands of lofty palm trees blooming white that led their perfume to the tropic sea, where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night, and the trades float above them fresh and free.

 some view our sable race with scornful eye, “their color is a diabolic dye.” remember, christians, negroes, black as cain, may be refined, and join the angelic train.  phillis wheatley, “on being brought from africa to america” the mother bending over a baby named shug chuckles, “gimme some sugar,” just to preface a flurry of kisses sweet as sugar cane. later, when she stirs a spoonful of domino into her coffee, who’s to tell the story how a ten-foot-tall reed from the old world, on being brought to the new, was raised and cropped so cooks could sweeten whatever tasted bitter? or how grade-a granulated began as a thick black syrup boiled for hours in an iron vat until it was refined to pure, white crystal.  when i was a child whose payoff for obeying orders was red-and-white-striped candy canes, i knew that sugar was love. the first time someone called me “sweetheart,” i knew sugar was love. and when i tasted my slice of the wedding cake, iced white and washed down with sweet champagne, don’t you know sugar was love.  one day evelina who worked for us showed up with her son bubba and laughed, “now y’all can play together.” he had a sweet nature, but even so we raised a little cain, and daddy told her not to bring him back. he thought i’d begun to sound like colored people. she smiled, dropped her eyes, kept working. and kept putting on weight. she later died of stroke. daddy developed diabetes by age fifty-five, insulin burned what his blood couldn’t handle. chronic depressions i have, a nutritionist gently termed “the sugar blues,” but damned if any lyrics come out of them, baby.  black-and-white negatives from a picture history of the sugar trade develop in my dreams, a dozen able-bodied slaves hacking forward through a field of cane. sweat trickles down from forehead into eye as they sheave up stalks and cart them to the mill where grinding iron rollers will express a thin sucrose solution that, when not refined, goes from blackstrap molasses on into rum, a demon conveniently negotiable for slaves. the master under the impression he owned these useful properties naturally never thought of offering them a piece of the wedding cake, the big white house that bubbling brown sugar built and paid for, unnaturally processed by domino.  phillis wheatley said the sweet christ was brought here from asia minor to redeem an african child and maybe her master’s soul as well. she wrote as she lived, a model of refinement, yes, but black as abel racing through the canebrake, demon bloodhounds baying in pursuit, until at last his brother caught him, expressed his rage, and rode back home to dinner. tell it to fats domino, to those who live on sugar hill, tell it to unsuspecting shug as soon as she is old enough to hear it.  one day evelina’s son waved goodbye and climbed on board a northbound train, black angels guiding him invisibly. in class he quoted a sentence from jean toomer: “time and space have no meaning in a canefield.” my father died last fall at eighty-one. love’s bitter, child, as often as it’s sweet. mm-mm, i sure do have the blues today: baby, will you give me some sugar?

 facing the wind of the avenues one spring evening in new york, i wore under my thin jacket a sweater given me by the wife of a genial manchurian.  the warmth in that sweater changed the indifferent city block by block. the buildings were mountains that fled as i approached them.  the traffic became sheep and cattle milling in muddy pastures. i could feel around me the large movements of men and horses.  it was spring in siberia or mongolia, wherever i happened to be. rough but honest voices called to me out of that solitude: they told me we are all tired of this coiling weight, the oppression of a long winter; that it was time to renew our life, burn the expired contracts, elect new governments.  the old imperial sun has set, and i must write a poem to the emperor. i shall speak it like the man i should be, an inhabitant of the frontier, clad in sweat-darkened wool, my face stained by wind and smoke.  surely the emperor and his court will want to know what a fine and generous revolution begins tomorrow in one of his remote provinces...

 my chalk is no longer than a chip of fingernail, chip by which i must explain this monday night the verbs “to get;” “to wear,” “to cut.” i’m not given much, these tired students, knuckle-wrapped from work as roofers, sour from scrubbing toilets and pedestal sinks. i’m given this room with five windows, a coffee machine, a piano with busted strings, the music of how we feel as the sun falls, exhausted from keeping up. i stand at the blackboard. the chalk is worn to a hangnail, nearly gone, the dust of some educational bone. by and by i’m cantiflas, the comic busybody in front. i say, “i get the coffee.” i pick up a coffee cup and sip. i click my heels and say, “i wear my shoes.” i bring an invisible fork to my mouth and say, “i eat the chicken.” suddenly the class is alive— each one putting on hats and shoes, drinking sodas and beers, cutting flowers and steaks—a pantomime of sumptuous living.  at break i pass out cookies. augustine, the guatemalan, asks in spanish, “teacher, what is ‘tally-ho’?” i look at the word in the composition book. i raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer. i stutter, then say, “es como adelante.” augustine smiles, then nudges a friend in the next desk, now smarter by one word. after the cookies are eaten, we move ahead to prepositions— “under,” “over,” and “between,” useful words when la migra opens the doors of their idling vans. at ten to nine, i’m tired of acting, and they’re tired of their roles. when class ends, i clap my hands of chalk dust, and two students applaud, thinking it’s a new verb. i tell them adelante, and they pick up their old books. they smile and, in return, cry, “tally-ho.” as they head for the door.

 poetry, wordsworth wrote, will have no easy time of it when the discriminating  powers of the mind are so blunted that all voluntary exertion dies, and  the general public is reduced to a state of near savage torpor, morose,  stuporous, with no attention span whatsoever; nor will the tranquil rustling  of the lyric, drowned out by the heavy, dull coagulation of persons in cities,  where a uniformity of occupations breeds cravings for sensation which hourly visual  communication of instant intelligence gratifies like crazy, likely survive this age.  
NEW POEM
 at a college in dearborn, michigan, i read a poem about watching girls at camp hold their breaths under the showers so i could see their breasts swell. some people call dearborn a hub of “terrorist” activity. i’ve placed the word terrorist between quotation marks because “arab” or “muslim” or “people who look like the terrorists we fear” is what they mean. in the poem about the camp i also use quotation marks around the words “pussy” and “chicken-shit,” but for different reasons — i’m waiting in line to jump over a dam into a river where other boys have drowned, and i hesitate, until someone shouts “pussy” and “chicken-shit” and you don’t need me to tell you what i did, what i had to do. a famous poet says for a speaker to express authority, he must possess three virtues, one of which is passion. after the reading a young man approached me. he turned out to be the younger brother of someone i knew and wrote a poem about, a lifeguard who saved a drowning girl. the child pulled from the pool could have been a boy — i don’t remember, it doesn’t matter. i care about what i’m saying — that matters. passion is a deep-seated conviction, says the famous poet. you need to believe that i believe. i told the young man in dearborn about his brother saving a life, as if he didn’t already know. he listened, politely, until i stopped talking and then he said i was out of line and had acted inappropriately. how, i asked. he said i shouldn’t use words like that. which words, i asked. he was getting flustered. i asked him again. i wanted him to say “pussy” and “chicken-shit.” he said i should not use words like that in front of women. by “women,” he meant arab and muslim women. maybe he meant all women. i don’t know, i didn’t ask. a lot of arabs and muslims live in dearborn. that’s why some people think of it as a hotbed of islamic terrorism. the phrase “a hotbed of islamic terrorism” should probably appear between quotes every time people use it, even if they are arab or muslim, like me. the other virtues a speaker should possess, says the famous poet, are discrimination and inclusiveness. by “discrimination” he means the speaker should come to his position without ignoring but considering opposed positions, and finding them wanting. by “inclusiveness” he means the speaker immediately sees connections between the subject at hand and other issues. also, the speaker needs to make the reader believe he is doing his subject justice, that he is relating it to the world. this makes his voice communal, speaking not for any community but with the goal of making communities, the first of which is that of speaker and reader. the young man speaking on behalf of arab and muslim women told me that my poems were “indecent” and “immoral,” that i should be ashamed, that i was a terrible muslim. “go fuck yourself,” is what i wanted to say, but — maybe he was right — so i smiled, i thanked him for listening, and i told him i loved his brother, and, “please, will you say i said hello.”

 sex is always monstrous. blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body. “please touch me there. more. oh god.” for a hitchhiker, the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift, itchy, unsafe space on the verge of a new mexico highway. it is often the sex of another era, in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed.  i hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me, ultra-american, like a christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick. at first, my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian; after all, it is not really hitchhiking to buy a greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons. again, this is an example of departure in another time. as a foreign student on scholarship, it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on salman rushdie’s early works. nevertheless: “how can we keep tabs on these ji visa holders, who come over here and . . . the university, as an institution, really needs to be more accountable. we need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information. they need to do their course work and then they need to go home.”  i didn’t want to go home. this is a boring sentence. perhaps for you oregon is a calming word, evoking images of blackberry pie, ocean vistas, and the capture of suspected felons. i had never heard the word oregon before. like the distance of scotland from london, it seemed impossibly far. a beautiful hazard: to go and keep going. how can i put this? in england, nobody ever, ever, ever did this. i, who once drove straight to glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar, in a dinged-up datsun cherry, was considered an anomaly. “are you demented? why do you want to drive in a car to bloody scotland? it’s seven hours on the m1, man!” though, outwardly, i was wan and somewhat reticent, i . . . no, i was. my sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in hyde park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the london school of economics that my breasts in that position, from that angle, resembled two fried eggs. we were meeting in a park as per the era. i am sure contemporary punjabi-british teenagers are fearless individuals, undaunted by the prospect of community censure. back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench, on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades. it is always a century. in my century, sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like scotland or wales and borrowing my father’s car forever. “are you out of your bleeding head? your dad’s going to skin you alive!”  in some sense, this (driving) is the opposite of hitchhiking, in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar. the day was real in a different way back then, in the way that it sensitized me to risk, a kind of twin to permisson. two black swans: that day and this one, history and fiction, what i went for and what i really wanted, which i didn’t know until i got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible, considering the trouble i was already in and the rain, which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets; the streetlamps were pink.  on prince street, in glasgow, i saw the sign for american style pizza and went down the steps to the basement café. the tables were coated with green plastic. there was hot tea, which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as i focused my eye on a laminated print of a white, blocky rose with a pink dot at its center. “charles rennie mackintosh,” the waitress, pronouncing “osh” so that it rhymed with horse. “are you from india?” “would you like some jam with that scone? i bet they don’t have scones in india, do they?” “more tea? i heard you have a lot of tea, over there, isn’t that right?”  plan b: the extension of my throat. the euphoria of theft. other countries with their sayings and beliefs. the original plan, formulated by my father during his morning communte across london: marrying a british-born hindu brahmin dentist with brown skin, but not too brown, and rosy cheeks. note on the mantelpiece, tucked behind the marble figurine of shiva: what is forthcoming under the original plan? extraction? what kind of sex is possible on the dentist’s chair late at night for that girl, your girl, who nervously asks for a blanket? she has her socks on. she’s shivering. it is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients, but in this scene the limbs of the dentist’s young asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash. dad, “please don’t swallow.” rinse then spit. spit then swallow.  i could not go home and so, after a brief visit to the hill house—charles rennie mackintosh’s art deco home on the firth of clyde, where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy, as it seemed from the décor—i turned left and kept driving. i drove my car into the atlantic and kept driving, my chest very tight beneath the surface. it was difficult to feel anything or really to see, and so i can only say that i went into a damaging ocean. this is going. damaged, washed up on the mythical shores of new jersey a few days later, my car failed to start. this is later, when the car stopped, and, looking up from my hands, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, i realized that i was okay.  now i am here, in the future of color. i’m sorry i do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival. i am not interested in it. i do not recall it. i . . . it was only when my car stopped that i realized what i had to do, on my own terms, with my own two legs: get going. is that how you say it? get up and go. the destiny of my body as separate from my childhood: i came here to hitchhike. i came here to complete a thing i began in another place. removing wet pages from my rucksack, i lay them on the shore, securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles. when they dried, i folded them into squares and put them in my pocket, next to my body. misshapen, exhilarated, i said get. i said go. get up now and go. “are you okay?” “do you need a ride somewhere?” “let me look in the trunk. i might have something in there. here you go. you’re shivering! do you need to go to the hospital? at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.”

 the relief of putting your fingers on the keyboard, as if you were walking on the beach and found a diamond as big as a shoe;  as if you had just built a wooden table and the smell of sawdust was in the air, your hands dry and woody;  as if you had eluded the man in the dark hat who had been following you all week;  the relief of putting your fingers on the keyboard, playing the chords of beethoven, bach, chopin in an afternoon when i had no one to talk to, when the magazine advertisement forms of soft sweaters and clean shining republican middle-class hair walked into carpeted houses and left me alone with bare floors and a few books  i want to thank my mother for working every day in a drab office in garages and water companies cutting the cream out of her coffee at 40 to lose weight, her heavy body writing its delicate bookkeeper’s ledgers alone, with no man to look at her face, her body, her prematurely white hair in love i want to thank my mother for working and always paying for my piano lessons before she paid the bank of america loan or bought the groceries or had our old rattling ford repaired.  i was a quiet child, afraid of walking into a store alone, afraid of the water, the sun, the dirty weeds in back yards, afraid of my mother’s bad breath, and afraid of my father’s occasional visits home, knowing he would leave again; afraid of not having any money, afraid of my clumsy body, that i knew no one would ever love  but i played my way on the old upright piano obtained for $10, played my way through fear, through ugliness, through growing up in a world of dime-store purchases, and a desire to love a loveless world.  i played my way through an ugly face and lonely afternoons, days, evenings, nights, mornings even, empty as a rusty coffee can, played my way through the rustles of spring and wanted everything around me to shimmer like the narrow tide on a flat beach at sunset in southern california, i played my way through an empty father’s hat in my mother’s closet and a bed she slept on only one side of, never wrinkling an inch of the other side, waiting, waiting,  i played my way through honors in school, the only place i could talk the classroom, or at my piano lessons, mrs. hillhouse’s canary always singing the most for my talents, as if i had thrown some part of my body away upon entering her house and was now searching every ivory case of the keyboard, slipping my fingers over black ridges and around smooth rocks, wondering where i had lost my bloody organs, or my mouth which sometimes opened like a california poppy, wide and with contrasts beautiful in sweeping fields, entirely closed morning and night,  i played my way from age to age, but they all seemed ageless or perhaps always old and lonely, wanting only one thing, surrounded by the dusty bitter-smelling leaves of orange trees, wanting only to be touched by a man who loved me, who would be there every night to put his large strong hand over my shoulder, whose hips i would wake up against in the morning, whose mustaches might brush a face asleep, dreaming of pianos that made the sound of mozart and schubert without demanding that life suck everything out of you each day, without demanding the emptiness of a timid little life.  i want to thank my mother for letting me wake her up sometimes at 6 in the morning when i practiced my lessons and for making sure i had a piano to lay my school books down on, every afternoon. i haven’t touched the piano in 10 years, perhaps in fear that what little love i’ve been able to pick, like lint, out of the corners of pockets, will get lost, slide away, into the terribly empty cavern of me if i ever open it all the way up again. love is a man with a mustache gently holding me every night, always being there when i need to touch him; he could not know the painfully loud music from the past that his loving stops from pounding, banging, battering through my brain, which does its best to destroy the precarious gray matter when i am alone; he does not hear mrs. hillhouse’s canary singing for me, liking the sound of my lesson this week, telling me, confirming what my teacher says, that i have a gift for the piano few of her other pupils had. when i touch the man i love, i want to thank my mother for giving me piano lessons all those years, keeping the memory of beethoven, a deaf tortured man, in mind; of the beauty that can come from even an ugly past.

 “but there were times when you offered your consent with older men. you chose them, &amp; you were not afraid. why not?”  you don’t know the true success of survival till you’ve experienced the adrenaline of a too-close death. what is there to fear when you’ve licked the edge? it is going to be an oppressively hot summer, the new york post says, but i’ve got a few of my own stowed away, enough to occupy a foreign desert.  there was one summer, his name was tito and my sisters still say his name just like that, “tee-toww,” the o a benchmark in the bottom of the jaw. i was just 12 but the gaze itself made me a flame, so no one could tell, i guess,  or no one would tell. he was the kind of heavy swelter that had the whole block at mercy, everyone’s connect to whatever they needed, which was much and in bulk. power is a switch that yokes me up at the waist — i was young &amp; enamored by this pattern of men who shouldn’t want me but would risk day to touch the stark chant of me. each time, i imagined a witchcraft enveloping the bone. i remember,  once, at some low hour in the trough* of that summer — my mouth a voyaging boat, tito’s spine a current of illicit knots, his hand a spindle on the back of my coarse head — he looks down at me, &amp; moans out “who the fuck are you?”  i say, and the answer is always the same thereafter: nobody, who are you?   *okay, in any event, elizabeth and i were in the pool, swimming and playing.

 there may be chaos still around the world, this little world that in my thinking lies; for mine own bosom is the paradise where all my life’s fair visions are unfurled. within my nature’s shell i slumber curled, unmindful of the changing outer skies, where now, perchance, some new-born eros flies, or some old cronos from his throne is hurled. i heed them not; or if the subtle night haunt me with deities i never saw, i soon mine eyelid’s drowsy curtain draw to hide their myriad faces from my sight. they threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe a happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.

 they call the mountain carlos because it is brown, though its purple slopes at dusk suggest other names. those who name it have to brand the earth with something they know—  a name, a face, even the heat that says "i know carlos and he is the mountain. i am going to cover his eyes in light." they call its peak carlos because it is the sharpest feature on the face that stares south, watching people cross the border, pausing to catch their breath and meet the cliffs of carlos because he is there.  when they ascend the canyons inside the face, carlos shifts and the climbers discover what he has done. the moving earth changes everything and they are forced to stop playing the game of naming a mountain that keeps touching the sun.

 what happened is, we grew lonely living among the things, so we gave the clock a face, the chair a back, the table four stout legs which will never suffer fatigue.  we fitted our shoes with tongues as smooth as our own and hung tongues inside bells so we could listen to their emotional language,  and because we loved graceful profiles the pitcher received a lip, the bottle a long, slender neck.  even what was beyond us was recast in our image; we gave the country a heart, the storm an eye, the cave a mouth so we could pass into safety.

 flags of all sorts. the literary life. each time we dreamt we’d done the gentlemanly thing, covering our causes in closets full of bones to remove ourselves forever from dearest possibilities, the old weapons re-injured us, the old armies conscripted us, and we gave in to getting even, a little less like us if a lot less like others. many, thus, gained fame in the way of great plunderers, retiring to the university to cultivate grand plunder-gardens in the service of literature, the young and no more wars. their continuing tributes make them our greatest saviors, whose many fortunes are followed by the many who have not one.

 the city humid, the church rusty and baroque, and the directions appalling, the miami sky turned gray as a blanket, and soon tropical rain was falling; the priest repeatedly invoked the beast in view, as if he were stalling; and in the back a few ushers whipped out their cell phones and started calling. what of the palm scrub, through which mildewed creatures came crawling, or the two cousins from chicago, who at the reception couldn't stop brawling? all weddings are madness, and except for the sherbet-hued bridesmaids not even a little enthralling. but the stooped and aged, what in their moth-eaten hours were they recalling? some first nervous kiss, perhaps, the razor of a touch, and all that "baby doll"-ing; then the mortgage in opa-locka, nine months of waiting, and half a life of squalling.  
NEW POEM
 well, how are things in heaven? i wish you’d say, because i’d like to know that you’re all right. tell me, have you found everlasting day, or been sucked in by everlasting night? for when i shut my eyes your face shows plain; i hear you make some cheery old remark— i can rebuild you in my brain, though you’ve gone out patrolling in the dark.  you hated tours of trenches; you were proud of nothing more than having good years to spend; longed to get home and join the careless crowd of chaps who work in peace with time for friend. that’s all washed out now. you’re beyond the wire: no earthly chance can send you crawling back; you’ve finished with machine-gun fire— knocked over in a hopeless dud-attack.  somehow i always thought you’d get done in, because you were so desperate keen to live: you were all out to try and save your skin, well knowing how much the world had got to give. you joked at shells and talked the usual “shop,” stuck to your dirty job and did it fine: with “jesus christ! when will it stop? three years ... it’s hell unless we break their line.”  so when they told me you’d been left for dead i wouldn’t believe them, feeling it must be true. next week the bloody roll of honour said “wounded and missing”—(that’s the thing to do when lads are left in shell-holes dying slow, with nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache, moaning for water till they know it’s night, and then it’s not worth while to wake!)  good-bye, old lad! remember me to god, and tell him that our politicians swear they won’t give in till prussian rule’s been trod under the heel of england ... are you there? ... yes ... and the war won’t end for at least two years; but we’ve got stacks of men ... i’m blind with tears, staring into the dark. cheero! i wish they’d killed you in a decent show.

 the pure products of america go crazy— mountain folk from kentucky  or the ribbed north end of jersey with its isolate lakes and  valleys, its deaf-mutes, thieves old names and promiscuity between  devil-may-care men who have taken to railroading out of sheer lust of adventure—  and young slatterns, bathed in filth from monday to saturday  to be tricked out that night with gauds from imaginations which have no  peasant traditions to give them character but flutter and flaunt  sheer rags—succumbing without emotion save numbed terror  under some hedge of choke-cherry or viburnum— which they cannot express—  unless it be that marriage perhaps with a dash of indian blood  will throw up a girl so desolate so hemmed round with disease or murder  that she'll be rescued by an agent— reared by the state and  sent out at fifteen to work in some hard-pressed house in the suburbs—  some doctor's family, some elsie— voluptuous water expressing with broken  brain the truth about us— her great ungainly hips and flopping breasts  addressed to cheap jewelry and rich young men with fine eyes  as if the earth under our feet were an excrement of some sky  and we degraded prisoners destined to hunger until we eat filth  while the imagination strains after deer going by fields of goldenrod in  the stifling heat of september somehow it seems to destroy us  it is only in isolate flecks that something is given off  no one to witness and adjust, no one to drive the car  
NEW POEM
 how will you cut off from zions, fall on your knees among the lions? what if you cut off from hymns confound worksong with anthem  cut off from scripture find sense suspect and worship incoherence— distrust the laces and adore the tangled thread?  what of you without a holy thing, but every sacrilege of the sacrileged class?  godsave your unsuspecting fists grasping the fiery ladder bare, your forehead fighting a wordless solitaire.  without some future language how can i ask you? if i could ask in euphorese, moonskrit, in ecolow....  what will you do with grandma’s savings — those relics atticked in your head of  effort, vision?  on pain of  death, scratch pictures in the dust as she did — i fear my after-thirst.  
NEW POEM
 i only recognized your hair: short, neatly combed. our mother  would’ve been proud. in the sonoran desert your body became a slaughter-  house where faith and want were stunned, hung upside down, gutted. we  were taught  to bring roses, to aim for the bush. remember? you tried to pork  a girl’s armpit. in border patrol jargon, the word  for border crossers is the same whether they’re alive or dead. when i read his flesh fell  off the bones, my stomach rumbled, my mouth  watered. yesterday, our mother said, “my high heels are killing me. let’s go back to the funeral.”  you were always  her favorite. slow cooking a roast melts the tough tissue between the muscle fibers;  tender meat remains.  remember the time i caught you pissing on a dog? you turned  away from me. in the small of your back i thought i saw a face. split lip,  broken nose. it was a mask. i yanked it from your flesh. i wear it often.  
NEW POEM
 it was necessary to move, and at this exit the beggar, cross-legged at the fork of the tunnel, calls out love! a welcome, of sorts. the night light fucks the suburb into nightmare familiarity — not like a shrammed nerd touting guided walks and histories that contract imagination for demolition work, levelling today's housing, restoring common greens, lingering at sites orphaned of their fever hospitals — by no means that hyperliterate, poor entrepreneur —  it is the view, the barbed wire roaring into view round and round the playground walltop. it is the warehouse, warehouse windows blank of occupation. it is lives, lives supplied in great number, fulfilment of numbers. it is the sense of something shared — the tailor scissors razoring open fishmouth stitches, the sewn-up pocket of the new suit, and finding something —  but it is new, all new, even the gangs who graffiti chimneys scrubbed and lovely, deleted like the railways delete repeatedly the head, the occasionally payrolled head, the feet of the quartered commuters, of the vertebral week.  
NEW POEM
 tell me not (sweet) i am unkind, that from the nunnery of thy chaste breast and quiet mind to war and arms i fly.  true, a new mistress now i chase, the first foe in the field; and with a stronger faith embrace a sword, a horse, a shield.  yet this inconstancy is such as you too shall adore; i could not love thee (dear) so much, lov’d i not honour more.  
NEW POEM
 to our land, and it is the one near the word of god, a ceiling of clouds to our land, and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns, the map of absence to our land, and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed, a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm to our land, and it is the one poor as a grouse’s wings, holy books ... and an identity wound to our land, and it is the one surrounded with torn hills, the ambush of a new past to our land, and it is a prize of war, the freedom to die from longing and burning and our land, in its bloodied night, is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far and illuminates what’s outside it ... as for us, inside, we suffocate more!  
NEW POEM
 wife and servant are the same, but only differ in the name: for when that fatal knot is tied, which nothing, nothing can divide: when she the word obey has said, and man by law supreme has made, then all that’s kind is laid aside, and nothing left but state and pride: fierce as an eastern prince he grows, and all his innate rigour shows: then but to look, to laugh, or speak, will the nuptial contract break. like mutes she signs alone must make, and never any freedom take: but still be governed by a nod, and fear her husband as a god: him still must serve, him still obey, and nothing act, and nothing say, but what her haughty lord thinks fit, who with the power, has all the wit. then shun, oh! shun that wretched state, and all the fawning flatt’rers hate: value your selves, and men despise, you must be proud, if you’ll be wise.  
NEW POEM
 adorable images, plaster of paris lilies of the field, you are not alive, therefore pathos will be out of place.  but i have learned a strange fact about your fate, and it is this:  after you go out of fashion beneath your many fashions, or when your elbows and knees have been bruised powdery white, so that you are no good to anybody—  they will take away your gowns, your sables and bathing suits, leaving exposed before all men your inaccessible bellies and pointless nubilities.  movers will come by night and load you all into trucks and take you away to the camps, where soldiers, or the state police, will use you as targets for small-arms practice,  leading me to inquire, since pathos is out of place, what it is that they are practicing.   november 1961  
NEW POEM
 past fences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processions of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing point like fretboards carrying barbed melodies, windharp narratives, songs of place, i’m thinking of the long cowboy ballads ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught me the ends if he could have remembered them. but remembering was years ago when ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day and found, and played guitar in a saturday night band, and now he is dead and i’m remembering near the end when he just needed a drink before he could tie his shoes. we’d stay up all night playing the beginnings of songs like falling leaf, about a girl who died of grief, and zebra dun, about a horse that pawed the light out of the moon. sometimes ray would break through and recall a few more verses before he’d drop a line or scramble a rhyme or just go blank, and his workfat hands would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief. between songs he’d pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that sounded like nails in a paper bag. done, he’d straighten and say,my cough’s not just right, i need another cigarette, and light the parliament he bit at an upward angle like roosevelt and play the start of another song. then, played out and drunk enough to go home, he’d pick up his hat and case and make it, usually on the second try, through the front gate and gently list out into the early morning dark, beginning again some song without end, yodeling his vote under spangles.

 for harry cobb soon i’ll move to norway. if that’s a bitter pill,  well, swill, swallow. i’m going, and i won’t wallow, not in norway,  where they’re so beyond slave labor, with laws that say  a clerk must work within five meters of a window through  which she can see a tree and by that tree be seen.  my mind’s made up. i will be norwegian with norwegian  trees. i’ll be seer and be seen. it’s a scenic scene, it’s  how it goes, i’m going. tell the top brass, if  they ask, i don’t give a damn about their asses.  but i will miss the beeches and the ashes. it’s not their fault i’m leaving.  they’re only trees, and leaving, i’m norwegian.

 tomato pies are what we called them, those days, before pizza came in, at my grandmother’s restaurant, in trenton new jersey. my grandfather is rolling meatballs in the back. he studied to be a priest in sicily but saved his sister maggie from marrying a bad guy by coming to america. uncle joey is rolling dough and spooning sauce. uncle joey, is always scrubbed clean, sobered up, in a white starched shirt, after cops delivered him home just hours before. the waitresses are helping themselves to handfuls of cash out of the drawer, playing the numbers with moon mullin and shad, sent in from broad street. 1942, tomato pies with cheese, 25 cents. with anchovies, large, 50 cents. a whole dinner is 60 cents (before 6 pm). how the soldiers, bussed in from fort dix, would stand outside all the way down warren street, waiting for this new taste treat, young guys in uniform, lined up and laughing, learning italian, before being shipped out to fight the last great war.

 gustave morin's primary form is the collage poem. his "toon tune" is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship. its sixty-three individual fragments of text are cut into the shapes of jigsaw puzzle pieces and are fit perfectly together in a rectangular grid. the "words" of the poem consist almost entirely of the extravagant visualizations of onomatopoeia from comic books, producing a visual symphony of crashes and cries.—geof huth  more about visual poetry &gt;&gt;

 offshore, the apocalypse stays contained to one island and its church.  venice's ruler's out wedding himself to the ocean  while i'm ankle deep in the adriatic, eyes raised to a book  unencumbered by words: a bible that reads from east to west. guidebooks want only  to see it as ceiling—the basilica san marco,  where christ's hands open on wounds embedded with rubies, and priests  hold back the sea with brooms. i'm taking on incense,  bowing at altars dragged out of constantinople, sloshing across marble sacked from jerusalem.  offshore, the sea's a bride bought with a fist full of diamonds the doge throws into the deep—  a sign of his true and perpetual dominion.  then why does walking into this church mean stepping into the ocean? the sea is a dog— priests throw in bones just to placate it.  the year's nearly 2000, but the millennium already hit once  on the island torcello, a kind of plague the venetians contained. 999 years,  and the dead still crawl from dirt towards their radiant bodies, they still gather up  missing limbs: arms, legs, hands sharks and beasts keep regurgitating.  we do what we know— but christ never wanted to manage resurrections in venice.  underdressed in the flesh from dead civilizations, he moves among us in byzantine skin.  i'm getting close to this god worshiped only by tourists.  he picks at the wounds on his crucified body, the injury scabbed over with jewels.

 roxana from the court retiring late, sigh'd her soft sorrows at st. james's gate: such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breast, not her own chairmen w th more weight opprest; they groan the cruel load they're doom'd to bear ; she in these gentler sounds express'd her care.  " was it for this, that i these roses wear, " for this new-set my jewels for my hair ? " ah ! princess ! with what zeal have i pursu'd ! " almost forgot the duty of a prude. " thinking i never cou'd attend too soon, " i've miss'd my prayers, to get me dress'd by noon. " for thee, ah ! what for thee did i resign ? " my pleasures, passions, all that e'er was mine. " i sacrific'd both modesty and ease, " left operas, and went to filthy plays ; " double entendres shock'd my tender ear, " yet even this for thee i chose to bear. " in glowing youth, when nature bids be gay, " and ev'ry joy of life before me lay, " by honour prompted, and by pride restrain'd, " the pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd : " sermons i sought, and with a mien severe " censur'd my neighbours, and said daily pray'r. " alas ! how chang'd! — with the same sermon mien  " that once i pray'd, the what-d'ye call't i've seen. " ah ! cruel princess, for thy sake i've lost " that reputation which so dear had cost : " i, who avoided ev'ry publick place, " when bloom, and beauty bid me show my face ; " now near thee constant ev'ry night abide " with never-failing duty by thy side, " myself and daughters standing on a row, " to all the foreigners a goodly show ! " oft had your drawing-room been sadly thin, " and merchants wives close by the chair had been seen ; " had not i amply fill'd the empty space, " and sav'd your highness from the dire disgrace.  " yet coquetilla's artifice prevails, " when all my merit and my duty fails : " that coquetilla, whose deluding airs " corrupts our virgins, and our youth ensnares ; " so sunk her character, so lost her fame, " scarce visited before your highness came ; " yet for the bed-chamber 'tis her you chuse, " when zeal and fame and virtue you refuse. " ah ! worthy choice ! not one of all your train " whom censure blasts not, and dishonours stain. " let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs, " and the proud pea-hen snatch the cuckoo's eggs ! " let iris leave her paint, and own her age, " and grave suffolkia wed a giddy page ! " a greater miracle is daily view'd, " a virtuous princess with a court so lewd.  " i know thee, court ! with all thy treach'rous wiles, " thy false caresses and undoing smiles ! " ah ! princess, learn'd in all the courtly arts " to cheat our hopes, and yet to gain our hearts.  " large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim ; " and the neglected patriot follows fame. " the prince is ogled ; some the king pursue ; " but your roxana only follows you. " despis'd roxana, cease, and try to find " some other, since the princess proves unkind : " perhaps it is not hard to find at court " if not a greater, a more firm support.

 minnesota snapping turtles clutched by little cities  are wet busts of moonstone wreathed in scum, the gray self sugared,  half a lot of granite phlegm stopped  upon a chaise longue, that incoming pod of him  dunked, thorny hooves aswim. lichen licked him,  then he quivered in the stem, and didactic stoicism stitched  him tight with a neat twine. even when  tapped on the back by a barefoot tricyclist with a bulging wheaten midriff,  he does not respond except that a flagellant  paddling worm nested in the necropolis  of his nape twists in disgust under the skin,  keeping all the grim social hate safe in him.

 thus from a mixture of all kinds began, that het’rogeneous thing, an englishman: in eager rapes, and furious lust begot, betwixt a painted britain and a scot. whose gend’ring off-spring quickly learn’d to bow, and yoke their heifers to the roman plough: from whence a mongrel half-bred race there came, with neither name, nor nation, speech nor fame. in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran, infus’d betwixt a saxon and a dane. while their rank daughters, to their parents just, receiv’d all nations with promiscuous lust. this nauseous brood directly did contain the well-extracted blood of englishmen.  which medly canton’d in a heptarchy, a rhapsody of nations to supply, among themselves maintain’d eternal wars, and still the ladies lov’d the conquerors.  the western angles all the rest subdu’d; a bloody nation, barbarous and rude: who by the tenure of the sword possest one part of britain, and subdu’d the rest and as great things denominate the small, the conqu’ring part gave title to the whole. the scot, pict, britain, roman, dane, submit, and with the english-saxon all unite: and these the mixture have so close pursu’d, the very name and memory’s subdu’d: no roman now, no britain does remain; wales strove to separate, but strove in vain: the silent nations undistinguish’d fall, and englishman’s the common name for all. fate jumbled them together, god knows how; what e’er they were they’re true-born english now.  the wonder which remains is at our pride, to value that which all wise men deride. for englishmen to boast of generation, cancels their knowledge, and lampoons the nation. a true-born englishman’s a contradiction, in speech an irony, in fact a fiction. a banter made to be a test of fools, which those that use it justly ridicules. a metaphor invented to express a man a-kin to all the universe.  for as the scots, as learned men ha’ said, throughout the world their wand’ring seed ha’ spread; so open-handed england, ’tis believ’d, has all the gleanings of the world receiv’d.  some think of england ’twas our saviour meant, the gospel should to all the world be sent: since, when the blessed sound did hither reach, they to all nations might be said to preach.  ’tis well that virtue gives nobility, how shall we else the want of birth and blood supply? since scarce one family is left alive, which does not from some foreigner derive.

 when i say the ghost has begun you understand what is being said. that time is not how we keep it or measure first there was then wasn’t . . . it twitters and swerves like the evening news. now outside is 3d. inside non- representational space. every law has an outside and inside i have witnessed cruelty break and gulp and sweat then punch out a smile. to be awake. this talking in space. to be absorbed in the ongoing. belief’s a shadow to be looked into and into until relief is gone. the dark triangle settled in the midst of traffic is on us. time comes in adverbial bursts, a glass of beer, a smoke . . . the evening air refreshes, startles, and the questions grow deeper like shadows across storefronts. a forsythia ticking against the dirty pane. this was time. up. down. up. and you were a part of it. if i say it can you feel it now? imagine. lightning strikes. rain falls and drives. clouds pass. night clarified. stars. in silent pictures the tree falls in the optic nerve. the sound is chemistry. there’s no getting to it or if getting to it feels like the actual sound is that silence? alone here with my shadows drawn . . . so what’s this about? a horse and a castle, a tree and its leaving? what’s this about in solitary splendor? the undertow and its threshold, a door and the opening sky? or because a play of reflection lit up my bumper and caught my eyes i saw the shadow of a falcon. because a sound a poor man uttered reached my ear i fell into song. if the syntax of loyalty is not tragic then what is the wager? if there were time, would it be ours?  
NEW POEM
 i think continually of those who were truly great. who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history through corridors of light, where the hours are suns, endless and singing. whose lovely ambition was that their lips, still touched with fire, should tell of the spirit, clothed from head to foot in song. and who hoarded from the spring branches the desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.  what is precious, is never to forget the essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth. never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light nor its grave evening demand for love. never to allow gradually the traffic to smother with noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.  near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields, see how these names are fêted by the waving grass and by the streamers of white cloud and whispers of wind in the listening sky. the names of those who in their lives fought for life, who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre. born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun and left the vivid air signed with their honour.

 it’s like so many other things in life to which you must say no or yes. so you take your car to the new mechanic. sometimes the best thing to do is trust.  the package left with the disreputable-looking clerk, the check gulped by the night deposit, the envelope passed by dozens of strangers— all show up at their intended destinations.  the theft that could have happened doesn’t. wind finally gets where it was going through the snowy trees, and the river, even when frozen, arrives at the right place.  and sometimes you sense how faithfully your life is delivered, even though you can’t read the address.

 startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor’s mutt, it banged its buzzard’s head then couldn’t solve the problem of the white pine’s limbs with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. somewhere an awkward angel knows whether it was dead before it hit the ground. any sinner could tell it was dead after— eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids, feet drawn up almost as high as hands. i loved to watch thistle and millet disappear beneath it in the yard. as snow covers feathers that will still be iridescent in the spring i remember seeing a businessman take a dripping handful of pocket change and throw it down a subway grate beside a homeless man. the coins bounced and clattered, vanishing in the humid dark. the rich man said now you’re having a shitty day too. but it’s not a shitty day and won’t be when i retrieve the bird and walk it— toes curling stiff from a shopping bag— to a houseless scrap of oak savannah birdseed drew it from and dig it into deeper snow so what was hoarded by a man may by the thaw be doled.

 if it’s true that johnny weismuller stole his tarzan yell from the alpine yodel, did hank williams in the back seat of his cadillac dream the ululation of bedouin women  welcoming the horsemen back from war? when i was a boy only a fool would fake a country sound, and my father made his voice over to ring as simple as jack parr’s  midwest porkless, yamless, no-cornbread-or-cracklin’ patter. he didn’t want to be from butts county, georgia, and hated farm chores and coveralls. football got him out. the fbi  gave him a way to travel under cover, but i have heard him, years later, after choir practice and the church social, sit back with a pall mall and follow eight-finger fleming’s  banjo frail. he’d hold that smoke deep, his ash glowing till his throat was bathed in tar, and then he’d cut loose and scroll it out, a yodel to make roy rogers blush. it was no hymn,  i’ll tell you. we had a brick split-level in the suburbs, and the radio station of choice adored perry como’s croon. my mother adopted words like boocoo and oodles to mask  her peach-orchard drawl. an uncle might tell a farmer’s daughter joke, the rake fleeing the cocked shotgun stopping on a hill to yodel, “andyouroldladytoo,”  but nobody could say ain’t or you’uns or i’ll get to it directly

 my words were sent underground to where the toggle switch detonates. that was the glare our voices were avoiding. there was something also   broken about the obedience of this retainer. the arcades weren’t semaphores just because the arrows leading there facilitated those   of us in line as though reliant on east or west quadrants. the ticket master was prone to elide requests from the travelers, the sliding doors   sounded a fanfare for the common man, get faster as thought, or mind the gaps. what i infer can never altogether establish a space adequate   to the body count. the platform motivates two guardians who were instructed in safekeeping to usher me from harm’s way but my stand   point so recedes from this tableaux as to acknowledge a footprint perspective. translucent envelope inside remaindered by the riptide   or such tunnel vision as to warrant arrest. why i was sent to the nether world inflicted with no wound. someone lets fall a pair of zip locks   containing the pixie sticks of this conspiracy; what i had to say was sent, i mentioned this i think already, underground switch and toggle   intended to ignite what i could never bring myself to mean. where the voices were avoiding me—hands outstretched at quarter day to hold   back the beam—was there something broken? i weather compliant. i rally.

 a working river, a working valley, the gray-green rhône lined with workings, heaps of dust, gravel, cement, and log jams waiting for transport, like the island exporting itself to its neighbors one barge at a time.  the river, the road, and the railway, a plait, a tangle, a place of through. the river not navigable, the boggy valley floor not walkable, the locals came down from the mountains a little way to site castles on moraine and regulate trade.  hannibal marched his elephants through here, dynamited rocks with vinegar. poplars were planted en passant by napoleon’s grande armée two-hundred-some years ago. goethe came to visit. the shade endures.  rilke was reminded of spain. he lived among apricots at muzot, just the other side of the language barrier, and fixed to be buried with a view of france. no one knows who i am, were his dying words.  smells of hay and dung, the murmurs of subtle conversation next door are tax-efficient sheep the underground chicken palace like cern or a discreet gun emplacement. the lights come on when we appear, and go off after we’re gone.  larchwood and rye bread, chocolate and slate, dried beef and stone all one striated substance, the staff of life breaking explosively, crumblingly, if it breaks at all,  a stash of daunting verticals, a washing machine delivered by helicopter winched down into the renaissance casbah. time was a man had to carry his donkey across his shoulders up a cliff; now everything is tunnel fodder.  electricity and water come piped through the mountains, the vineyards get a sousing under great rainbow arcs, who wouldn’t want to die in a thirteenth-century tower with light sensors and cold running water off the hills and a chill in the sunny air of the contemporary archaic.

 the missile to launch a missile was almost a secret. two male ph.d.’s were picked and primed to fill it and one hundred carefully counted insects, three almost new snakes, coiled in a cube, exactly fifty fish creatures in tanks, the necessary files, twenty bars of food, ten brief cures, special locks, fourteen white rats, fourteen black rats, a pouch of dirt, were all stuffed aboard before the thing blasted from the desert.  and the missile that launched a missile launched out into a marvelous scientific balloon that rolled and bobbed about in the mists of venus; suddenly sank like a sweet fat grape, oozing past gravity to snuggle down upon the triumphant shape of space. the two men signaled earth, telling their continent v enus is g reen . and parades assembled, the loud earth tellers spent all fifteen minutes on it, even shortened their weather forecast. but rival nations, angry and oily, fired up their best atom blast and the last earth war was done. the place became crater on each side, sank down to its first skull, shedding forests, oceans, dried bones and neons, as it fell through time like a forgotten pitted stone.  these two men walked hopefully out onto their hot empty planet with machines, rats, tanks, boxes, insects and the one odd set of three almost new snakes, to make the tests they were meant to do. but on the seventh month the cages grew small, too small to interview, too tight to bear. the rats were gray and heavy things where they ran against wire and the snakes built eggs on eggs and even the fish began to bump in water as they spawned on every side of each other’s swim. and the men grew listless; they opened the pouch of dirt, undid each locked bin and let every creature loose to live on venus, or anyhow hide under rocks. bees swarmed the air, letting a warm pollen slide from their wings and onto the grass. the fish flapped to a small pool and the rats untangled their hairs and humped over the vestibule of the cramped balloon. trees sprang from lichen, the rock became a park, where, even at star-time, things brushed; even in the planet’s new dark crotch, that air snag where snakes coupled and rats rubbed in disrepair, it grew quick and noisy with a kind of wonder in the lonely air.  old and withered, two ph.d.’s from earth hobbled slowly back to their empty balloon, crying alone for sense, for the troubling lack of something they ought to do, while countless fish slapped and the waters grew, green came taller and the happy rats sped through integrated forests, barking like dogs at the top of the sky. but the two men, that last morning of death, before the first of light, watched the land of venus, its sweetless shore, and thought, “this is the end. this is the last of a man like me.” until they saw, over the mists of venus, two fish creatures stop on spangled legs and crawl from the belly of the sea. and from the planet park they heard the new fruit drop.

 the shape of it bending like an eel or disfigured quarter moon, pink and green and brown, like a rainbow trout. the wall  along my bed covered with the map i cut from the newspaper, and next to it the fishing calendar from abonauder’s texaco. the square  cages of days with their numerals and effigies of moon and fish shaded to indicate the shape of the moon, the hunger of the fish.  the white bread stripped of its crust, dampened, then dusted with flour, compressed into a tight ball, wrapped in foil and chilled all night.  a piece of it pressed and shaped on the tip of an eagle claw hook, then lowered into the nesting holes of blue gill. the plastic bobber floating  on the surface like a silent doorbell. a whole world of cause and effect, framed day-by-day and week-by-week. the passage of time as a kind of game in which  i transferred numbers from the newspaper to the calendar. the body counts and their categories of nvra, marines, montagnards.  and each morning i put a bold x through the previous day not to erase or forget it but to connect the corners, make four triangles of the square.  and it was rare if not impossible to catch the blue gill that swam and swam around the tidy pebble craters of their nests,  or coax them out except in hostile swerves and feints toward the bait that hung like a balloon of gravity over their homes,  a suspicious egg pouch or cocoon, something a storm might have dislodged from the bank and blown like a feared gift into the water,  a thing swallowed whole then run with until the line played out and the hook set fast.

 a half-view of greenery, cut off by blinds. pinecones hanging in pairs, like testicles. brain balls, someone once said at a pool. we were in it, looking up at a guy getting out. this angle replicates that one, but the view is more animated, less peopled.  the sky’s changeups are reminders that this will not drag on forever, despite the ergonomic ease afforded by the seat first devised for geriatric care, then stripped down. it’d seem rational: if the elderly spent their days in recliners, so could others, dot-commers, say, properly incentivized.  and at least there is no symbolic logic, with eliminands and retinends. no lasting premises either; we will be priced out of any area. no sooner than the conclusion is accepted as consequent and part and parcel of this universe of discourse, we’ll come to realize the sense in having new places to leave.  this is the chair’s democracy. particularly this one, with its form-fitting mesh forsaking foam and padding, which cause overheating and cloud the sitter’s judgment. it’s recyclable, and that matters.  still, the office chair’s revolution is an oxymoron.

 (to saul touster) i. january 22, 1932  could a four-year-old look out of a square sedan (a studebaker six in currency green with wooden artillery wheels) and see a scene of snow, light lavender, landing on deepening blue buildings built out of red-violet bricks, and black passersby passing by over the widening white streets darkening blue, under a thickening white sky suddenly undergoing sheer twilight, and the yellow but whitening streetlights coming on, and remember it now, though the likelihood is gone that it ever happened at all, and the village is gone that it ever could happen in? memory, guttering out, apparently, finally flares up and banishes doubt.   ii. may 29, 1941  tring. bells on grocers’ boys’ bicycles ring, followed, on cue, by the jaunty one-note of prayers at two near churches; taxi horns, a-hunt, come in for treble; next, the tickety bass of chain-driven diamond t’s, gone elephantine and stove-enamelled conifer green down greenwich avenue. out of the earle i issue at half-past thirteen, struck, like a floral clock, by seasonal manifestations: unreasonable n.y.u. girls out in their bobby socks and rayon blouses; meek boys with their books who have already moulted mackinaws; desarrolimiento of new chrome-green leaves; a rose, got, blooming, out of bed; and mrs. roos- evelt and sarah delano descending the front stoop of a jamesian house facing south against the square, the sun— who, curveting, his half course not yet run, infects the earth with crescence; and the presence of process, seen in un-top-hatted, un-frock-coated burghers and their sons and daughters, taking over all title, right, and interest soever in this, now their property, washington square.   iii. december 29, 1949  the hotel storia ascends above me and my new wife; ends eight stories of decline, despair, iron beds and hand-washed underwear above us and our leatherette chattels, still grounded on the wet grey tessellated lobby floor. soon, through a dingy, numbered door, we’ll enter into our new home, provincials in imperial rome to seek their fortune, or, at least, to find a job. the wedding feast, digested and metabolized, diminishes in idealized group photographs, and hard today shunts us together and at bay. outside the soot-webbed window, sleet scourges the vista of eighth street; inside, the radiators clack and talk and tell us to go back where we came from. a lone pecan falls from our lunch, a sticky bun, and bounces on the trampoline of the torn bedspread. in the mean distance of winter, a man sighs, a bedstead creaks, a woman cries.   iv. july 14, 1951  a summer lull arrives in the west village, transmuting houses into silent salvage of the last century, streets into wreckage uncalled-for by do-gooders who police the moderniqueness of our ways, patrol the sanitation of the urban soul. what i mean is, devoid of people, all our dwellings freeze and rust in desuetude, fur over with untenancy, glaze grey with summer’s dust and incivility, with lack of language and engagement, while their occupants sport, mutate, and transform themselves, play at dissembling the god norm from forward bases at fire island. but— exception proving rules, dissolving doubt— young gordon walker, fledgling editor, my daylong colleague in the corridors of power &amp; leicht, the trade-book publishers, is at home to the residue in his acute apartment in an angle of abingdon square. and they’re all there, the rear- guard of the garrison of fort new york: the skeleton defense of skinny girls who tap the typewriters of summertime; the pale male workers who know no time off because too recently employed; the old manhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds; the writers (walker’s one), who see in their city as desert an oasis of silence and time to execute their plots against the state of things, but fall a prey to day succeeding day alone, and call a party to restore themselves to all the inside jokes of winter, in whose caul people click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall, insensible, into odd pockets. dense as gander-feather winter snow, intense as inextinguishable summer sun at five o’clock (which it now is), the noise of walker’s congeries of girls and boys foregathered in their gabbling gratitude strikes down the stairwell from the altitude of his wide-open walk-up, beckoning me, solo, wife gone north, to sickening top-story heat and talk jackhammering upon the anvils of all ears. “christ, lou, you’re here,” whoops walker, topping up a jelly jar (“crabapple,” says the label, still stuck on) with gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke that seeks its level in my unexplored interior, and sends back a sonar ping to echo in my head. two more blue gins. the sweat that mists my glasses interdicts my sizing up my interlocutor, who is, i think, the girl who lives next door, a long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform girl cellist propped on an improbably slim leg. gin pings are now continuous. the room swings in its gimbals. in the bath is silence, blessed, relative, untorn by the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap, a clear and present invitation. like a climber conquering k.28, i clamber over the white porcelain rock face, through whitish veils of rubberized shower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline in the encaustic crater, where a fine thread of cold water irrigates my feet, to sleep, perchance to dream of winter in the village, fat with its full complement of refugees returned to their own turf— unspringy as it is—in a strong surf of retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed on the unlovely birthplace of their mixed emotions, marriages, media, and met- aphors. lord god of hosts, be with them yet.

 in memory of my parents people whose lives have been shaped by history—and it is always tragic— do not want to talk about it, would rather dance, give parties on thrift-shop china. you feel wonderful in their homes, two leaky rooms, nests they stowed inside their hearts on the road into exile. they know how to fix potato peelings and apple cores so you smack your lips.  the words start over again hold no terror for them. obediently they rise and go with only a rucksack or tote bag. if they weep, it’s when you’re not looking.  to tame their nightmares, they choose the most dazzling occupations, swallow the flames in the sunset sky, jump through burning hoops in their elegant tiger suits. cover your eyes: there’s one walking on a thread thirty feet above us— shivering points of light leap across her body, and she works without a net.

 vivas to those who have fail'd! and to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea! and to those themselves who sank in the sea! and to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes! and the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known! —walt whitman i. the red flag  the newspapers said the strikers would hoist the red flag of anarchy over the silk mills of paterson. at the strike meeting, a dyers' helper from naples rose as if from the steam of his labor, lifted up  his hand and said here is the red flag: brightly stained with dye for the silk of bow ties and scarves, the skin and fingernails boiled away for six dollars a week in the dye house.  he sat down without another word, sank back into the fumes, name and face rubbed off by oblivion's thumb like a roman coin from the earth of his birthplace dug up after a thousand years, as the strikers shouted the only praise he would ever hear.  ii. the river floods the avenue  he was the other valentino, not the romantic sheik and bullfighter of silent movie palaces who died too young, but the valentino standing on his stoop to watch detectives hired by the company bully strikebreakers onto a trolley and a chorus of strikers bellowing the banned word scab. he was not a striker or a scab, but the bullet fired to scatter the crowd pulled the cork in the wine barrel of valentino's back. his body, pale as the wings of a moth, lay beside his big-bellied wife.  two white-veiled horses pulled the carriage to the cemetery. twenty thousand strikers walked behind the hearse, flooding the avenue like the river that lit up the mills, surging around the tombstones.blood for blood, cried tresca: at this signal, thousands of hands dropped red carnations and ribbons into the grave, till the coffin evaporated in a red sea.  iii. the insects in the soup  reed was a harvard man. he wrote for the new york magazines. big bill, the organizer, fixed his good eye on reed and told him of the strike. he stood on a tenement porch across from the mill to escape the rain and listen to the weavers. the bluecoats told him to move on. the harvard man asked for a name to go with the number on the badge, and the cops tried to unscrew his arms from their sockets. when the judge asked his business, reed said:poet. the judge said:twenty days in the county jail.  reed was a harvard man. he taught the strikers harvard songs, the tunes to sing with rebel words at the gates of the mill. the strikers taught him how to spot the insects in the soup, speaking in tongues the gospel of one big union and the eight-hour day, cramming the jail till the weary jailers had to unlock the doors. reed would write: there's war in paterson. after it was over, he rode with pancho villa.  iv. the little agitator  the cops on horseback charged into the picket line. the weavers raised their hands across their faces, hands that knew the loom as their fathers' hands knew the loom, and the billy clubs broke their fingers. hannah was seventeen, the captain of the picket line, the joan of arc of the silk strike. the prosecutor called her a little agitator. shame, said the judge; if she picketed again, he would ship her to the state home for girls in trenton.  hannah left the courthouse to picket the mill. she chased a strikebreaker down the street, yelling in yidish the word for shame. back in court, she hissed at the judge's sentence of another striker. hannah got twenty days in jail for hissing. she sang all the way to jail. after the strike came the blacklist, the counter at her husband's candy store, the words for shame.  v. vivas to those who have failed  strikers without shoes lose strikes. twenty years after the weavers and dyers' helpers returned hollow-eyed to the loom and the steam, mazziotti led the other silk mill workers marching down the avenue in paterson, singing the old union songs for five cents more an hour. once again the nightsticks cracked cheekbones like teacups. mazziotti pressed both hands to his head, squeezing red ribbons from his scalp. there would be no buffalo nickel for an hour's work at the mill, for the silk of bow ties and scarves. skull remembered wood.  the brain thrown against the wall of the skull remembered too: the sons of italy, the workmen's circle, local 152, industrial workers of the world, one-eyed big bill and flynn the rebel girl speaking in tongues to thousands the prophecy of an eight-hour day. mazziotti's son would become a doctor, his daughter a poet. vivas to those who have failed: for they become the river.

 the town’s trees, roomy with winter, have begun of late to fill with them, a settling that commences with dusk. the widows complain —  claim they can smell them, can hear them shuffling in the trees, a wing hitting a branch a sound sharp, they say, as ice cracking. they cannot  sleep. and so you form a committee, convening with shotguns to fire every night into the darkling  congregation. every night, the air resounds with that resolve, and every dusk they return with theirs, circle, a lazy familiar vortex  around a drain, an old appointment they keep with an inescapable place; this argument no way, claude says, to be any less afraid.

 take a statement, the same as yesterday’s dictation: lately pain has been there waiting when i awake. creative despair and failure have made their patient. anyway, i’m afraid i have nothing to say. those crazy phrases i desecrated the paper with against the grain ... taste has turned away her face temporarily, like a hasty, ill-paid waitress at table, barely capable but very vague. mistaken praise and blame degrade profane and sacred places so strange you may not even know their names. vacant the gymnasium where words once played naked amazing games that always used to end in mate.  better, then, the effort than preterite perfection, i guess. indeed, i envy the eminent dead the special effects i am ready to inherit less than their sentiments and impenitent sense of aesthetic gesture. unpleasant and pretentious, the western hemisphere has plenty to forget. the mess men might yet make of themselves, given present events! are many content to accept the best? precious as sex is, flesh, perenially wretched, begs the bread of heaven, blessing nevertheless the unexpected sender’s address on a letter. every breathless sentence says not yet to death.  the past cannot matter except as an abstraction, a flattering caricature of happy lands wherein many a grand, imaginary castle in fact turns out to be a tourist trap at last, a vast palace that adrastic phantoms inhabit. maps of madness, characteristically blank, ask vatic questions, exact a magic answer: the family photograph album at a glance, granny, dad, aunt sally, that dissatisfied madame who manages passion’s incalculable acts, paris, everyman’s romantic trash and tarry— abracadabra, and the vanished cast comes back!  if civilization isn’t a silly gimmick, is it the wit to wish, the will to make it stick? the mathematical vision which built this system figures the width of a minute within an inch. primitive physics, a sophisticated fiction, insists that in principle everything is fixed. visitors picnic amid pretty chichèn itzá with its sacrificial pit, artificial hills and cricket pitch wherein the winner is the victim. to think an instinct like iniquity exists! hidden riches fill big individual middens; in the wizard’s pyramid little lizards live.  specious sweets we reach for eagerly with eve’s evil greed recede like the fleeting details of a dream. it seems that we have been a brief season in eden: chic unreal estates where immediately green trees repeated in completely meaningless series briefly yield to the weaker tyranny of weeds even as we seek relief in a secret clearing. prehistory can be too recent; need we read these steles’ queried speech? here undefeated peoples experienced deceit; here scenes of deepest grief teach us to weep the cheap and easy tears of reason; here the sea of being sleeps, a period peace.  frustration, fuss, and lust are love’s unlucky colours. thunderstruck, the muscular monuments look dumb. judged by the numbers that once flourished in the jungle in hundreds of miles of dull undercover scrub, unless somebody was insufferably ugly mistrust of one another must be in the blood. unsuccess in a dozen tough struggles instructs us justice is a mother-fucker. suffering’s fun for a month, but in a millenium no wonder one becomes somewhat disgusted. unsubtle skull, the mysteries of dust are nothing to live up to. insulted by a touch, one mutters, “summer sucks.”  undone by the siesta and by sudden showers, is it uncomfortable in the hungry south? now cowed by kulkulkan’s geometrical scowl, now wowed by the classic brown faces in a crowd, you falter at mounds memorial to a thousand bleeding hearts in a single holiday cut out, submitted to the sun, insatiable flesh-flower of the universe, all-devouring powerhouse, confounded by our sound of pronounceable vowels. myths, as the guidebook says, are handed down by mouth. though mood and voice and person, gender, tense, and number predicate a verb, its cases explain a noun:  proper noun or pronoun, indubitably human, whose beautiful excuse is usually youth doomed to the brutal usufructu of the future, consumed by the illusions of jejune amours. you used to choose the rules with superfluous humour, tuned to the influential movements of the moon whose smooth, translucent route through roofless rooms illumines from dewy moonrise unto lunar afternoon tulum and its improvements, tumulus and ruins, poorly reproduced, a too crudely stupid view. who knew nude truth from rumour, amusement from music soon would prove a fool. beauty, useless, is a wound.  on and off; the impossible is honour’s motto, monotony the awful drawback of my song. what was lost was often all we had got in common, our quasi-comic quandary depended on qu’en dirai-je? chronic, colossal hypochondry, neurotic complication or hypnotic calm. gods begotten of loss, not bronze nor terra cotta, haunt the province of law, of cause and conscious wrong. following the long count a lot has been forgotten: positive nonsense, fraud, false plots and hollow talk, soporific concepts toppled by fall or conquest, the cosmos as a model watch that wants to stop.  at any moment the doors of the soul may open and those reproachful ghosts invoked from the remote coasts of tomorrow begin to impose the order of bone and trophy, home and the odour of smoke. o mornings that broke on the slopes of cold volcanos, almost frozen, golden and old-rose, like a scroll slowly unfolded, or a brocade robe thrown over the throne of the mountains, cloaking their cones in snow! hope, an emotion swollen by every omen, no psychotrope, only a semiprecious stone, topaz or opal, adorns the close of the strophe. woe wrote these notes in a code also known as prose.  ode: this leafy, streamless land where coy waters loiter under the embroidered soil, subterfluous coin of another culture destroyed by lack of moisture, spoiled by the unavoidable poison of choice. archaeological lawyers exploit the foibles of a royalty that in time joined hoi polloi: history’s unemployed, geography’s anointed, unlike the orchids of the forests, spin and toil. imperfectly convinced of final disappointment, persuaded of the possibility of joy, pen poised for the pointless impressions of those voices that boil up like bubbles on the face of the void,  finally i try to define why divine silence underlies the tidy designs of paradise. priceless as the insights of the inspired psyche, blind, violent as a geyser, right as a rhyme, fine ideas likely to undermine the idle mind divided between the types of fire and ice, “highly stylized” politely describes the bright eyesores shining like diamonds or rhinestones in the night sky, lifelike, provided life survives its vital cycle and the tireless indictment of time’s diatribe, while mankind, sightless, frightened, like a child in twilight, dies of the devices it was enlightened by.  amazing games that always used to end in mate! precious as sex is, flesh, perennially wretched, in fact turns out to be a tourist trap at last. the mathematical vision which built this system of the universe, all-devouring powerhouse, (the mysteries of dust are nothing to live up to!) briefly yields to the weaker tyranny of weeds. you used to choose the rules with superfluous humour: monotony, the awful drawback of my song, slowly unfolded, like a brocade robe thrown over. persuaded of the possibility of joy, finally i tried to define why divine silence ...

 it’s not so easy to smash the compass. to rely on the winds     the golden hum of herb kane clouds navigating the tips of these mountains.  it’s not so easy to modify the compass. to apologize when your brothers are spreading the sashimi and churning the shoyu mustard.  it’s not so easy to ignore the compass because it seems to have always been here in all its sextant glory     pointing distracting you from wākea’s blue teeth nibbling papa’s chest.  it’s not so easy     but it’s possible to say “aloha, for now” to family and friends pouring bags of ice into clean coolers before the big show.  to walk past uncle’s squid lū‘au bubbling green, to get in that car and drive, with nothing but a fistful of quarters for the library xerox machine.  it’s possible     because when those books slide across the counter and you walk to an empty table     the compass begins to shake and the needle is never the same    again.  with every turn of a pacific page you realize      pukas are being filled or new ones      uncovered. and the art of listening brings with it memories, of the physics of his hips and hands     when you first saw him cast that net     slicing the horizon.  the needle doesn’t like it when you flatten the cube to discover your kūpuna were always just around the corner    from where you sit      now. and the halftime show hasn’t even started, yet.  the time it takes to get from the third million-dollar commercial to the fifth     is equal to the time it takes to find the kānaka maoli name of the land that raised you     buried under the pavements     under the brand new      two-lane     fast food      drive-thru.  but what the compass really hates      what it’s really afraid of is when you see the lo‘i in the same way that you see that empty sunday afternoon library     when you finally see the moana in your kūpuna’s eye.  so now      when you return home and the cooler is empty and the sashimi spiral is nearly gone   unfurl those xerox copies across the dining table     consoling the cousins who lost money on the spread.  and as the compass repairs itself    as it always does it will feel the sting when it finds you       tomorrow with your back being warmed by the morning sun.

 anyone with quiet pace who walks a gray road in the west may hear a badger underground where in deep flint another time is  caught by flint and held forever, the quiet pace of god stopped still. anyone who listens walks on time that dogs him single file,  to mountains that are far from people, the face of the land gone gray like flint. badgers dig their little lives there, quiet-paced the land lies gaunt,  the railroad dies by a yellow depot, town falls away toward a muddy creek. badger-gray the sod goes under a river of wind, a hawk on a stick.

 o living pictures of the dead, o songs without a sound, o fellowship whose phantom tread hallows a phantom ground— how in a gleam have these revealed the faith we had not found.  we have sought god in a cloudy heaven, we have passed by god on earth: his seven sins and his sorrows seven, his wayworn mood and mirth, like a ragged cloak have hid from us the secret of his birth.  brother of men, when now i see the lads go forth in line, thou knowest my heart is hungry in me as for thy bread and wine; thou knowest my heart is bowed in me to take their death for mine.

 the muses are turned gossips; they have lost the buskined step, and clear high-sounding phrase, language of gods. come, then, domestic muse, in slip-shod measure loosely prattling on, of farm or orchard, pleasant curds and cream, or droning flies, or shoes lost in the mire by little whimpering boy, with rueful face — come, muse, and sing the dreaded washing day. ye who beneath the yoke of wedlock bend, with bowed soul, full well ye ken the day which week, smooth sliding after week, brings on too soon; for to that day nor peace belongs, nor comfort; ere the first grey streak of dawn, the red-armed washers come and chase repose. nor pleasant smile, nor quaint device of mirth, ere visited that day; the very cat, from the wet kitchen scared, and reeking hearth, visits the parlour, an unwonted guest. the silent breakfast meal is soon despatched, uninterrupted, save by anxious looks cast at the louring, if sky should lour. from that last evil, oh preserve us, heavens! for should the skies pour down, adieu to all remains of quiet; then expect to hear of sad disasters — dirt and gravel stains hard to efface, and loaded lines at once snapped short, and linen-horse by dog thrown down, and all the petty miseries of life. saints have been calm while stretched upon the rack, and montezuma smiled on burning coals; but never yet did housewife notable greet with a smile a rainy washing day. but grant the welkin fair, require not thou who callest thyself, perchance, the master there, or study swept, or nicely dusted coat, or usual ’tendence; ask not, indiscreet, thy stockings mended, though the yawning rents gape wide as erebus; nor hope to find some snug recess impervious. shouldst thou try the ’customed garden walks, thine eye shall rue the budding fragrance of thy tender shrubs, myrtle or rose, all crushed beneath the weight of coarse-checked apron, with impatient hand twitched off when showers impend; or crossing lines shall mar thy musings, as the wet cold sheet flaps in thy face abrupt. woe to the friend whose evil stars have urged him forth to claim on such a dav the hospitable rites; looks blank at best, and stinted courtesy shall he receive; vainly he feeds his hopes with dinner of roast chicken, savoury pie, or tart or pudding; pudding he nor tart that day shall eat; nor, though the husband try — mending what can’t be helped — to kindle mirth from cheer deficient, shall his consort’s brow clear up propitious; the unlucky guest in silence dines, and early slinks away. i well remember, when a child, the awe this day struck into me; for then the maids, i scarce knew why, looked cross, and drove me from them; nor soft caress could i obtain, nor hope usual indulgencies; jelly or creams, relic of costly suppers, and set by for me their petted one; or buttered toast, when butter was forbid; or thrilling tale of ghost, or witch, or murder. so i went and sheltered me beside the parlour fire; there my dear grandmother, eldest of forms, tended the little ones, and watched from harm; anxiously fond, though oft her spectacles with elfin cunning hid, and oft the pins drawn from her ravelled stocking, might have soured one less indulgent. at intervals my mother’s voice was heard, urging dispatch; briskly the work went on, all hands employed to wash, to rinse, to wring, or fold, and starch, and clap, and iron, and plait. then would i sit me down, and ponder much why washings were; sometimes through hollow hole of pipe amused we blew, and sent aloft the floating bubbles; little dreaming then to see, montgolfier, thy silken ball ride buoyant through the clouds, so near approach the sports of children and the toils of men. earth, air, and sky, and ocean hath its bubbles, and verse is one of them — this most of all.

 watts bleeds leaving stained reminders on dusty sidewalks.  here where i strut alone as glass lies broken by my feet and a blanket of darkness is slung across the wooden shacks of nuetsra colonia.  watts bleeds dripping from carcasses of dreams: where despair is old people sitting on torn patio sofas with empty eyes and children running down alleys with big sticks.  watts bleeds on vacant lots and burned-out buildings– temples desolated by a people’s rage.  where fear is a deep river. where hate is an overgrown weed.  watts bleeds even as we laugh, recall good times, drink and welcome daylight through the broken windshield of an old impala.  here is the watts of my youth, where teachers threw me from classroom to classroom, not knowing where i could fit in.  where i learned to fight or run, where i zigzagged down alleys, jumped over fences, and raced by graffiti on crumbling factory walls.  where we played between boxcars, bleeding from broken limbs and torn flesh, and where years later we shot up carga in the playground of our childhood.  watts bleeds as the shadow of the damned engulfs all the chinga of our lives.  in the warmth of a summer night, gunshots echo their deadly song through the silence of fear; prelude to a heartbeat.  watts bleeds as i bled getting laid-off from work, standing by my baby’s crib, touching his soft check and fingering his small hand as dreams shatter again, dreams of fathers for little men.  watts bleeds and the city hemorrhages, unable to stop the flow from this swollen and festering sore.  oh bloom, you trampled flower! come alive as once you tried to do from the ashes.  watts, bleeding and angry, you will be free.

 we the people, we the one times 320 million, i’m rounding up, there’s really too many grass blades to count, wheat plants to tally, just see the whole field swaying from here to that shy blue mountain. swaying as in rocking, but also the other definition of the verb: we sway, we influence, we impress. unless we’re asleep, the field’s asleep, more a postcard than a real field, portrait of the people unmoved. you know that shooting last week? i will admit the number dead was too low to startle me if you admit you felt the same, and the person standing by you agrees, and the person beside that person. it has to be double digits, don’t you think? to really shake up your afternoon? i’m troubled by how untroubled i felt, my mind’s humdrum regarding the total coffins, five if you care to know, five still even if you don’t. i’m angry i’m getting used to it, the daily gunned down, pop-pop on wednesday, thursday’s spent casings pinging on the sidewalk. it all sounds so industrial, there’s nothing metal that won’t make a noise, i’m thinking every gun should come with a microphone, each street with loudspeakers to broadcast their banging. we would never sleep, the field always awake, acres of swaying up to that shy blue mountain, no wonder why it cowers on the horizon, i mean look at us, look with the mountain’s eyes we the people putting holes in the people.

 everything you thought you knew must be relearned overnight.  how to walk. walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s, used coffee cups, concrete cores. walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across rebar or a wood plank; glide, not wobble, not look like the bounce beneath each bootstep scares you.  how to dress yourself to work outdoors all day midwinter and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving; or midsummer, with no hint of breasts.  how to climb ladders– not a stepstool or a 4-footer– ladders that stretch up two stories where someone’s impatient for that bundle of pipe.  how to get coffee– hot and how they like it–to a crew spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins three blocks in a paper sack through sheets of rain.  how to look. to never go back empty-handed when you’re told,grab me a this/that from the gangbox, if all you’ve done is move things around, poke here and there; if you haven’t emptied out the full contents so the journeyman won’t shame you by finding this/that in a quick minute, after you’ve said,we don’t have any.  how to be dependable but not predictable-provokable. not the lunch break entertainment.  how to read blueprints, delivery orders, the mood on the job; how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee; how early you can start rolling up cords.  how to do well in school from the back row of a seats-assigned-jim-crow classroom how to learn tricks-of-the-trade from someone who does not like you.  how to listen, to act-don’t-ask. to duck when someone motions,duck! or when someone tells you,don’t talk to zeke, to know what they mean so you don’t even look at zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out, last in, standing there, so four times a day– start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him, like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth, that catches debris.  how to pick up the phone and call your friend, the only one of the women not at class the night the apprenticeship director met you all at the door carrying the nervous rumor that one of the women had been raped and you all look at each other and it wasn’t any of you five.  how to respond–within protocol– when someone takes your ladder or tools, imitates your voices on the loudspeaker, spraypaints cunt on your baker staging, urinates in your hardhat, drives to your home where you live alone with your daughter and keys your truck parked in your own driveway.  later, you’ll need the advanced skills: how–without dislodging the keystone– to humiliate a person, how to threaten a person. deftly. so no one’s certain for absolute that’s what happened. not even you.

not knowing that tribal people lived in the garden of eden comparatively speaking that is they had more humanity than later people who traded theirs for technology so that those people who look back at earth some day from a distant galaxy will not be people at all comparatively speaking they will be cue balls  but this morning i am not in a billiard situation the sun is shining onto my house and the trees are feeling like their tops because they are still in the garden of eden that is the gentle endless hush of an endless mother to her endless newborn child things are there covered with sparkles that have nothing to do with sunlight the way one night i got out of bed and found that i was covered with sparkles very small ones i wondered if i would be covered with sparkles the rest of my life and if other people had them but these are not the same sparkles that things have on them except the ocean sometimes at night  by day the ocean moves away from where it was but a mountain does not somewhere in between lies hidden valley where grandpa comes out of his cabin and staggers around the dooryard then goes back inside where grandma is holding a baking tin of fresh hot biscuits but she will give him none give me some biscuits he cries but she smiles and shakes her head they are all for me she exults and then laughs she is only joking grandpa sits down at the table and pretends to be dead revived only by die muffled thud of the biscuit tin where's mah coffee he roars even though he sees it in the cup before him and grandma says we're plumb out that's how the day begins in hidden valley  but where are the grandchildren they are scattered about the world in jagged pieces that move like birds in spring with colors and speedometers on them someday they will return to hidden valley and form another mountain to make hidden valley even more hidden when the waterfall closes over it  you think i don't know where it is  or is that just a ploy to get me to tell you? you are like the guy who looked all over for his hat and later learned it was on his head but it didn't mean anything until he realized he had a head and that the hat was both on and inside it and when he did it was not a rabbit that he pulled out but a rectangle in which the rabbit was imprisoned you don't want to be that guy, do you? you would rather be the rabbit when all along you could have been the waterfall  we move ahead in our story to five years later then we move five years back because there is no story only a collection of events with no beginning, no end, and therefore no middle, it is all one big beginning, middle, and end every second and though you are in it you are also to the side like an actor waiting in the wings for the cue that will cause the stage to light up and expand though it is also the cue for the audience to rise and head for the exits, because they are the real players and you, it turns out, are part of the scenery propped up against a wall, gathering dust along your top ridge, for soon you will be transported to hidden valley and placed among the other mountains  one of these mountains is the earl of essex covered with the crud of having galloped all the way across wales and england nonstop essex who dashed up the palace stairs and barged into elizabeth's private chamber unannounced —where no man had ever set foot— midst the gasps and cries of her ladies-in-waiting and there it is his face on the front of his head and her face coming off her head and starting toward him because she knew right then his head would be severed from his body but what she did not know is that he too would end up in hidden valley raining down his sparkles upon the house of grandma and grandpa  are you enjoying your vacation yes i am in fact so much that i don't even think of it as a vacation or as anything else and come to think of it i don't even think of it it's just the way things are how about you yes i too am enjoying my vacation well good  silence  what you just said about your vacation i'm not sure i understand what you mean i didn't mean much of anything i guess the mountains around here have a way of making me not think very much maybe because they aren't thinking at all who knows and i tend to become like whatever i'm around  but you're always around air do you turn into air yes i'm always air what about grandma and grandpa are you turning into them no i can't turn into them i already am them  well that is very interesting but i have to scoot along now  and a fine day to you as well  ireland rose up on the horizon backlit by history but hidden valley was too powerful it made ireland sink back down though the voices of ireland could be heard in the distance some singing others laughing and some wailing and scolding and then they too faded when grandpa brandished his lips at them  for he wished to sing himself and all alone on the veranda of his own personality the one built partly by him and partly by the celestial carpenters who found his scratchy gurgling caterwauling arias to be as astonishing as he found them to be beautiful and moving— arias that caused tears to gush forth from the sky you could see when you looked up into his eyes not long after you were born the sky at night  and professional wrestling was on tv antonino rocca bounded around the ring evading horrible huge guys who fought dirty the kind you would find only in new york city when it was in black and white little antonino who looked like a short-order cook in a diner but who dodged and slid and leaped so fast the horrible big guys couldn't catch him but when they did, ow! get away, antonino! and he came back to life and slithered free and hurled the big guys down and one-two-three boom they were pinned and once more he smiled at people like us out in the middle of nowhere prompting grandpa to clear his throat and say it's time for bed it's way past time and it was but we were hidden outside of time and no one would know because they were visible inside of time i was happy in hidden valley happy enough and i'm happy i once lived there maybe i'll find myself there again someday even though the mountains will be gone and the rest changed beyond all recognition

 for fabbio doplicher we were supposed to do a job in italy and, full of our feeling for ourselves (our sense of being poets from america) we went from rome to fano, met the mayor, mulled a couple matters over (what's a cheap date, they asked us; what's flat drink). among italian literati  we could recognize our counterparts: the academic, the apologist, the arrogant, the amorous, the brazen and the glib—and there was one  administrator (the conservative), in suit of regulation gray, who like a good tour guide with measured pace and uninflected tone narrated sights and histories the hired van hauled us past. of all, he was the most politic and least poetic, so it seemed. our last few days in rome (when all but three of the new world bards had flown) i found a book of poems this unprepossessing one had written: it was there in the pensione room (a room he'd recommended) where it must have been abandoned by the german visitor (was there a bus of them?) to whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before. i couldn't read italian, either, so i put the book back into the wardrobe's dark. we last americans  were due to leave tomorrow. for our parting evening then our host chose something in a family restaurant, and there we sat and chatted, sat and chewed, till, sensible it was our last big chance to be poetic, make our mark, one of us asked "what's poetry?" is it the fruits and vegetables and marketplace of campo dei fiori, or the statue there?" because i was  the glib one, i identified the answer instantly, i didn't have to think—"the truth is both, it's both," i blurted out. but that was easy. that was easiest to say. what followed taught me something about difficulty, for our underestimated host spoke out, all of a sudden, with a rising passion, and he said:  the statue represents giordano bruno, brought to be burned in the public square because of his offense against authority, which is to say the church. his crime was his belief the universe does not revolve around the human being: god is no fixed point or central government, but rather is poured in waves through all things. all things move. "if god is not the soul itself, he is the soul of the soul of the world." such was his heresy. the day they brought him forth to die, they feared he might incite the crowd (the man was famous for his eloquence). and so his captors placed upon his face an iron mask, in which  he could not speak. that's how they burned him. that is how he died: without a word, in front of everyone. and poetry— (we'd all put down our forks by now, to listen to the man in gray; he went on softly)— poetry is what  he thought, but did not say.

 what land have you cast from the blotted-out region of your face?  what nation stung by watermarks was filmed out of extinction and brought forth resembling frost?  what offspring must jump through the eye of birth to be winked at when covered with brick sweat?  what ache piled its planks on the corner pier, now crumbles onto motionless water, sniffed at by forest smoke?  what makes this song a string of beads seized by cement cracks when the camera climbs through the basement window—winter clouds coiling through its speckled lens?  what season cannot locate an eye in the dark of the sound of the sun gyrating into red ocher after i thought you noticed my language was half wren, half pigeon and, together, we spoke a wing pattern on the wall that was raised to keep “us” out, there where “calling” became “culling,” “distance” distanced, in a mere scrape of enamel on yellow teeth?  what father woke, turned over his wife, she didn’t want to, but he pushed until the baby leapt through, now, now, now, strummed into a chorus of burn marks on ceilings where police sirens fruit magpie skulls on trees of monsoon lightning?  what, what, what—is how that song chimed in wilderness.

 they basically grow it out of sand. this is a big help because otherwise it was getting pretty enigmatic. welcome to the desert of the real, i am an ephemeral and not too discontented citizen. i do not think the revolution is finished. so during these years, i lived in a country where i was little known, with the thunder of the gods that protect the icelandic tundra from advertising, great red gods, great yellow gods, great green gods, planted at the edges of the speculative tracks along which the mind speeds from one feeling to another, from one idea to its consequence past the proud apartment houses, fat as a fat money bag. i wish that i might stay in this pleasant, conventional city, a placid form, a modest form, but one with a claim to pleasure, and then vanish in the fogs of hypnolondon. all are in their proper place in these optical whispering-galleries, the swan-winged horses of the skies with summer’s music in their manes, the basic los angeles dingbat, a housewife in any neighborhood in any city in any part of mexico on a saturday night. every sunday is too little sunday, a living grave, the true grave of the head. in one shout desire rises and dies. composed while i was asleep on horseback i drift, mainly i drift.

 you will leave your home: nothing will hold you. you will wear dresses of gold; skins of silver, copper, and bronze. the sky above you will shift in meaning each time you think you understand. you will spend a lifetime chipping away layers of flesh. the shadow of your scales will always remain. you will be marked by sulphur and salt. you will bathe endlessly in clear streams and fail to rid yourself of that scent. your feet will never be your own. stone will be your path. storms will follow in your wake, destroying all those who take you in. you will desert your children kill your lovers and devour their flesh. you will love no one but the wind and ache of your bones. neither will love you in return. with age, your hair will grow matted and dull, your skin will gape and hang in long folds, your eyes will cease to shine. but nothing will be enough. the sea will never take you back.

 1. josef mengele drowns while swimming at a beach in brazil, 1979  his name then: wolfgang gerhard. how easy, slipping on another man’s skin. another country, too,  its sun’s heat and light as insistent as a pair of forceps.  his pants, left crumpled on the beach, forged papers and a few hard candies in the pocket.  where the water was shallow, he could look down and see  his shadow passing over the pale sand, a wobbly twin,  matching him stroke for stroke for stroke.   2. li po drowns trying to embrace the reflection of the moon in the yangtze, 762  the moon is no drinker of wine, so i must compensate. surely you’ve heard  the crows and nightingales egging me on? the day has dispersed from the courtyards like a gang of sparrows, and nothing  is left of the world that is not pecked-over, hard and dark as the dream of an apple seed.  the young men laugh at an old man drinking alone, but here  are my companions: my shadow, as loyal and thin as a starved dog,  and the moon, his whole face wrinkling with laughter.   3. bob, the circus seal, drowns himself in his tank in galveston, 1911  by then his teeth had rotted out, and he often turned to his owner with his mouth open as if about  to speak, a ruined smell jetting from inside.  he had already attempted it,  three days before, but his owner dove in and pulled him up onto the slimy planks. his circus show days  were long gone. sure, some afternoons a kid might walk by and see the scabby painting  on the side of the building: the hoop, the pedestal, the ghost of a man in a top hat,  the striped ball now like a clot of pus streaked with blood, hovering  over the sleek, dark head.   4. natalie wood drowns under mysterious circumstances near santa catalina island, 1981  let me tell you: death is a long silk glove dropped to the floor.  it doesn’t remember the heft of the arm, the fingers dancing.  that limb is gone, and nothing will hold its shape again.  you twirl your pastel skirt. you watch two cars race toward the cliff, and there is nothing  you can do. so many lives you’ve entered like a room: swooned,  held the prop pistol to your own face, sang for the back row. but was it your voice?  what was that name you were born into? natalia nikolaevna zakharenko? what happened to her?  was she the one taken, her family butchered, living another life among the enemy people?  was it the morning? when she stopped scanning the horizon for rescuers that she turned into you?   5. hippasus of metapontum is drowned at sea for the heresy of discovering irrational numbers, ca. 500 bce  his fellow pythagoreans had already built a shrine to his memory and placed it where  he passed by every day, but he did not take the hint. it was on the ship that they seized him.  god was an integer, firm as an unripe apricot. but weren’t there streets in the city that wound forever into the minute darkness?  weren’t there dreams where he met himself again and again, without ever seeming to wake?  the sea is incommensurable. each lungful of air kept dividing itself, even as the boat  became a decimal point on the far horizon.   6. bennie wint, 20 years after faking his drowning death, is discovered alive, 2009  in the first years after i disappeared, i read every report of drowning: children,  mostly boys, mostly in their bathtubs, mostly accidents.  old men whose lungs filled with fluid while they sat in their armchairs.  fishermen. swimmers. immigrants crowded onto rafts. some men, their throats seize up, and they die without  ever swallowing a drop, as if they never left the shore.  some nights i dreamed what never happened: i held my drowning  in my palm like a giant pearl. some days, standing behind the cash register of my new life,  i felt my lungs flatten out like a pair of discarded socks. did i ever think  of the woman i left on the shore as i kicked out past the last of the breakers?  i won’t say. here it was: i might have drowned trying to pretend to. i had to swim so far out, then mark  a different beach and swim back  a different man, without knowing if his strength was enough to carry me to shore.

 in the backseat of my car are my own sons, still not yet tamir’s age, already having heard me warn them against playing with toy pistols, though my rhetoric is always about what i don’t like, not what i fear, because sometimes i think of  tamir rice &amp; shed tears, the weeping all another insignificance, all another way to avoid saying what should be said: the second amendment is a ruthless one, the pomp &amp; constitutional circumstance that says my arms should be heavy with the weight of a pistol when forced to confront death like this: a child, a hidden toy gun, an officer that fires before his heart beats twice. my two young sons play in the backseat while the video of  tamir dying plays in my head,&amp; for everything i do know, the thing i don’t say is that this should not be the brick and mortar of poetry, the moment when a black father drives his black sons to school &amp; the thing in the air is the death of a black boy that the father cannot mention, because to mention the death is to invite discussion of  taboo: if you touch my sons the crimson that touches the concrete must belong, at some point, to you, the police officer who justifies the echo of the fired pistol; taboo: the thing that says that justice is a killer’s body mangled and disrupted by bullets because his mind would not accept the narrative of  your child’s dignity, of  his right to life, of  his humanity, and the crystalline brilliance you saw when your boys first breathed; the narrative must invite more than the children bleeding on crisp fall days;&amp; this is why i hate it all, the people around me, the black people who march, the white people who cheer, the other brown people, latinos &amp; asians &amp; all the colors of   humanity that we erase in this american dance around death, as we are not permitted to articulate the reasons we might yearn to see a man die; there is so much that has to disappear for my mind not to abandon sanity: tamir for instance, everything about him, even as his face, really and truly reminds me of my own, in the last photo i took before heading off to a cell, disappears, and all i have stomach for is blood, and there is a part of me that wishes that it would go away, the memories,&amp; that i could abandon all talk of making it right &amp; justice. but my mind is no sieve &amp; sanity is no elixir &amp; i am bound to be haunted by the strength that lets tamir’s father, mother, kinfolk resist the temptation to turn everything they see into a grave &amp; make home the series of cells that so many of my brothers already call their tomb.

 1  when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom’d, and the great star early droop’d in the western sky in the night, i mourn’d, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.  ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring, lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west, and thought of him i love.  2  o powerful western fallen star! o shades of night—o moody, tearful night! o great star disappear’d—o the black murk that hides the star! o cruel hands that hold me powerless—o helpless soul of me! o harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.  3  in the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash’d palings, stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves of rich green, with many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume strong i love, with every leaf a miracle—and from this bush in the dooryard, with delicate-color’d blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of rich green, a sprig with its flower i break.  4  in the swamp in secluded recesses, a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.  solitary the thrush, the hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements, sings by himself a song.  song of the bleeding throat, death’s outlet song of life, (for well dear brother i know, if thou wast not granted to sing thou would’st surely die.)  5  over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities, amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets peep’d from the ground, spotting the gray debris, amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the endless grass, passing the yellow-spear’d wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen, passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards, carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave, night and day journeys a coffin.  6  coffin that passes through lanes and streets, through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land, with the pomp of the inloop’d flags with the cities draped in black, with the show of the states themselves as of crape-veil’d women standing, with processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night, with the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and the unbared heads, with the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces, with dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn, with all the mournful voices of the dirges pour’d around the coffin, the dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—where amid these you journey, with the tolling tolling bells’ perpetual clang, here, coffin that slowly passes, i give you my sprig of lilac.  7  (nor for you, for one alone, blossoms and branches green to coffins all i bring, for fresh as the morning, thus would i chant a song for you o sane and sacred death.  all over bouquets of roses, o death, i cover you over with roses and early lilies, but mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first, copious i break, i break the sprigs from the bushes, with loaded arms i come, pouring for you, for you and the coffins all of you o death.)  8  o western orb sailing the heaven, now i know what you must have meant as a month since i walk’d, as i walk’d in silence the transparent shadowy night, as i saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night, as you droop’d from the sky low down as if to my side, (while the other stars all look’d on,) as we wander’d together the solemn night, (for something i know not what kept me from sleep,) as the night advanced, and i saw on the rim of the west how full you were of woe, as i stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool transparent night, as i watch’d where you pass’d and was lost in the netherward black of the night, as my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad orb, concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.  9  sing on there in the swamp, o singer bashful and tender, i hear your notes, i hear your call, i hear, i come presently, i understand you, but a moment i linger, for the lustrous star has detain’d me, the star my departing comrade holds and detains me.  10  o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved? and how shall i deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone? and what shall my perfume be for the grave of him i love?  sea-winds blown from east and west, blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies meeting, these and with these and the breath of my chant, i’ll perfume the grave of him i love.  11  o what shall i hang on the chamber walls? and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls, to adorn the burial-house of him i love?  pictures of growing spring and farms and homes, with the fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright, with floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air, with the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees prolific, in the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and there, with ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows, and the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys, and all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.  12  lo, body and soul—this land, my own manhattan with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and the ships, the varied and ample land, the south and the north in the light, ohio’s shores and flashing missouri, and ever the far-spreading prairies cover’d with grass and corn.  lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty, the violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes, the gentle soft-born measureless light, the miracle spreading bathing all, the fulfill’d noon, the coming eve delicious, the welcome night and the stars, over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land.  13  sing on, sing on you gray-brown bird, sing from the swamps, the recesses, pour your chant from the bushes, limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.  sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song, loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.  o liquid and free and tender! o wild and loose to my soul—o wondrous singer! you only i hear—yet the star holds me, (but will soon depart,) yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me.  14  now while i sat in the day and look’d forth, in the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring, and the farmers preparing their crops, in the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes and forests, in the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds and the storms,) under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women, the many-moving sea-tides, and i saw the ships how they sail’d, and the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor, and the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages, and the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent—lo, then and there, falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest, appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail, and i knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.  then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, and the thought of death close-walking the other side of me, and i in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions, i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not, down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness, to the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.  and the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me, the gray-brown bird i know receiv’d us comrades three, and he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him i love.  from deep secluded recesses, from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still, came the carol of the bird.  and the charm of the carol rapt me, as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night, and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.  come lovely and soothing death, undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving, in the day, in the night, to all, to each, sooner or later delicate death.  prais’d be the fathomless universe, for life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious, and for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise! for the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.  dark mother always gliding near with soft feet, have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome? then i chant it for thee, i glorify thee above all, i bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.  approach strong deliveress, when it is so, when thou hast taken them i joyously sing the dead, lost in the loving floating ocean of thee, laved in the flood of thy bliss o death.  from me to thee glad serenades, dances for thee i propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee, and the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky are fitting, and life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.  the night in silence under many a star, the ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice i know, and the soul turning to thee o vast and well-veil’d death, and the body gratefully nestling close to thee.  over the tree-tops i float thee a song, over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide, over the dense-pack’d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways, i float this carol with joy, with joy to thee o death.  15  to the tally of my soul, loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird, with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.  loud in the pines and cedars dim, clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume, and i with my comrades there in the night.  while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed, as to long panoramas of visions.  and i saw askant the armies, i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags, borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc’d with missiles i saw them, and carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody, and at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) and the staffs all splinter’d and broken.  i saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, and the white skeletons of young men, i saw them, i saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war, but i saw they were not as was thought, they themselves were fully at rest, they suffer’d not, the living remain’d and suffer’d, the mother suffer’d, and the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer’d, and the armies that remain’d suffer’d.  16  passing the visions, passing the night, passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades’ hands, passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul, victorious song, death’s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song, as low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling, flooding the night, sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting with joy, covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven, as that powerful psalm in the night i heard from recesses, passing, i leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves, i leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.  i cease from my song for thee, from my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee, o comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.  yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night, the song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird, and the tallying chant, the echo arous’d in my soul, with the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe, with the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird, comrades mine and i in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for the dead i loved so well, for the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake, lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul, there in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.

 when the body wishes to speak, she will reach into the night and pull back the rapture of  this growing root which has little faith in the other planets of the universe, knowing only one, by the bulbs of the feet, their branching of toes. but the feet have walked with the bones of their ancestors over long trails leaving behind the roots of forests. they walk on the ghosts of all that has gone before them, not just plant, but animal, human, the bones of even the ones who left their horses to drink at the spring running through earth’s mortal body which has much to tell about what happened that day.  when the body wishes to speak from the hands, it tells of  how it pulled children back from death and remembered every detail, washing the children’s bodies, legs, bellies, the delicate lips of the girl, the vulnerable testicles of  the son, the future of my people who brought themselves out of the river in a spring freeze. that is only part of  the story of  hands that touched the future.  this all started so simply, just a body with so much to say, one with the hum of  her own life in a quiet room, one of the root growing, finding a way through stone, one not remembering nights with men and guns nor the ragged clothing and broken bones of my body.  i must go back to the hands, the thumb that makes us human, but then don’t other creatures use tools and lift what they need, intelligent all, like the crows here, one making a cast of earth clay for the broken wing of  the other, remaining until it healed, then broke the clay and flew away together.  i would do that one day, but a human can make no claims better than any other, especially without wings, only hands that don’t know these lessons.  still, think of  the willows made into a fence that began to root and leaf, then tore off the wires as they grew. a human does throw off   bonds if  she can, if  she tries, if  it’s possible, the body so finely a miracle of  its own, created of  the elements and anything that lived on earth where everything that was still is.

 in a vintage boutique on sullivan’s quay, i lift a winter coat with narrow bodice, neat lapels, a fallen hem. it is far too expensive for me, but the handwritten label  [1915]  brings it to my chest in armfuls of red. in that year, someone drew a blade through a bolt of fabric and stitched this coat into being. i carry it to the dressing room, slip my arms in. silk lining spills against my skin. i clasp the belt and draw a slow breath as a cramp curls again, where blood stirs and melts. in glass, i am wrapped in the weight of old red:  red pinched into girl cheeks and smeared from torn knees, lipstick blotted on tissue, bitten lips, a rough kiss, all the red bled into pads and rags, the weight of red, the wait for red, that we share.   in the mirror, the old coat blushes. this pocket may once have sheltered something precious — a necklace, a love letter, or a fresh egg, feather-warm, its shell brittle around a hidden inner glow, held loosely so it couldn’t crack, couldn’t leak through seams, so it couldn’t stain the dress within.

 for the person who obtained my debit card number and spent $11,000 in five days my pale stepdaughter, just off the school bus, scowled, "well, that's the last time i say my name's snodgrass!" just so, may that anonymous mexican male who prodigally claims  my clan lines, identity and the sixteen digits that unlock my bank account, think twice. that less than proper name's been taken by three ex-wives, each for an amount  past all you've squandered, each more than pleased to change it back. that surname you affect may have more consequence than getting teased by dumb kids or tracked down by bank detectives.  don't underrate its history: one of ours played piano on his prison's weekly broadcast; one got rich on a scammed quiz show; one made a bungle costing the world series. my own past  could subject you to guilt by association: if you write anything more than false checks, abandon all hope of large press publication or prizes—critics shun the name like sex  without a condom. whoever steals my purse helps chain me to my writing desk again for fun and profit. so take thanks with my curse: may your pen name help send you to your pen.

 when the forsaken city starts to burn, after the men and children have fled, stand still, silent as prey, and slowly turn  back. behold the curse. stay and mourn the collapsing doorways, the unbroken bread in the forsaken city starting to burn.  don’t flinch. don’t join in. resist the righteous scurry and instead stand still, silent as prey. slowly turn  your thoughts away from escape: the iron gates unlatched, the responsibilities shed. when the forsaken city starts to burn,  surrender to your calling, show concern for those who remain. come to a dead standstill. silent as prey, slowly turn  into something essential. learn the names of the fallen. refuse to run ahead when the forsaken city starts to burn. stand still and silent. pray. return.

 for joseph cady  camden, 1882 is it raining, mary, can you see? i hear rain. is the road black, is it shining? dark, i can see for myself. put on my red tie, red has life in it—most men i know dress like undertakers making sure they look mournful enough to manage their own funerals no accounting for taste: we should be grateful for that. help me get to the window, i want to see mickle street. don’t you hear it now, something like rain, off in the distance? my ear, maybe, is playing me tricks again; there was a rushing, like rain when it moves closer and starts a millstream in the trees. no? i guess my senses must be losing their touch. it was nothing. then, nothing more than a tantrum of the boneyard: best for me to hold still in this chair and listen to my beard grow. now if hair was poetry, then your walt whitman would be a great success. i wear out trying to come to terms with the wrong weather— what you might call speaking terms. i don’t want to talk to much else. you tell them to go home, mary, no visitors today—or one, just one: what else is a red tie for? some english poet, keeps me up, coming all the way here from california, colorado—coming to ask the usual questions. i don’t like questions that require answers: english questions. that’s a country of things answered. london is a city of things done with. brooklyn is different, new orleans, washington they’re my cities of romance, all the cities of things begun. i may have been deliberate, even laborious, but i never looked for finish. here, where’s his name? bucke wrote about him after hearing one of his lectures. i had it somewhere. you let him in, mary: no one else, no one ... i’m slipping—here it is, here’s the name!— slowly, maybe, but slipping. who can say he has hold of what might be called a standing? that’s what they do say, though, all these visitors— they write, they call, and they stay: it makes a problem doctor says: bar them. i can’t. i won’t. still, they bother me. one young fellow walks in, says, “walt, i should like to read you my epic and have your opinion of its worth.” “thank you,” say i, “but i’ve been paralyzed once already.” suppose someone took it in his head to come and sit here and say nothing! someone who knows even the first syllables of the great speech of silence ... today’s visitor, maybe, will mind his tongue, maybe spare you the trouble of putting his latest tribute on the shelf with all the rest. give me enemies rather than these disciples of mine. best thing i ever heard of browning is how he disapproves of all those societies. not that i quote browning, or care for him, or read him: i’ve tried browning on every way, but he don’t fit. tennyson— now he has his place, a local english place: i don’t see how the world could make much use of him elsewhere— but the others: i conclude most literature was written on all fours, and the rest on stilts! ... there, mary, the bell. i did hear that! i know my own bell, don’t i? go on, go on down, bring the man up ... in here, mr. wilde. this room is not such a ruin as it seems: i find most things i search for without much trouble— found dr. bucke’s letter with your name, for instance. found my red necktie as well. come in, you cast a shadow where you stand. come in, the chaos is more suspected than real.  i suspect no chaos: i am convinced of the cosmos in your company, walt whitman! i greet you, sir, as america’s great voice.  
NEW POEM
 i ask not wit, nor beauty do i crave, nor wealth, nor pompous titles wish to have; but since, 'tis doomed through all degrees of life, whether a daughter, sister, or a wife; that females should the stronger males obey, and yield implicit to their lordly sway; since this, i say, is ev'ry woman's fate, give me a mind to suit my slavish state.  
NEW POEM
 if you think you know enough to say this poem is about good hair, i'll correct you and tell you it's about history which is the blacksmith of our tongues. our eyes. where you see misunderstanding i see knuckles and teeth for sale in a storefront window. i see the waterlogged face of the fourteen-year-old boy. the bullet's imperceptible sizzle toward an unarmed man. and as you ask me to sign the book that is not mine, your gaze shifting between me and the author's photo, whispering, but that's not you? i do not feel sorry for you. no. i think only that when a man is a concept he will tell you about the smell of smoke. he will tell you the distance between heartbreak and rage.  
NEW POEM
 a wolf is at the laundromat, it's not a wary stare-wolf, it's short and fat, it tips its hat, unlike a scary glare-wolf.  it combs its hair, it clips its toes, it is a fairly rare wolf, that's only there to clean its clothes— it is a wash-and-wear-wolf.  
NEW POEM
 the woman who cannot bring forth her child: go to a dead man’s grave and then step three times over the grave, and then say these words three times:  this is my cure for the loathsome late-birth this is my cure for the bitter black-birth this is my cure for the loathsome imperfect-birth and when that woman is with child and she goes to her lord in his bed, then let her say:  up i go, over you i step, with a quick child, not a quelled one, with a full-born one, not a doomed one. and when the mother feels the child is quick, go then to a church, and when she comes before the altar say then:  christ, i said it. this has been uttered. the woman who cannot bring forth her child: grasp a handful of her own child’s grave, and after that, bind it in black wool and sell it to peddlers, and say then:  i sell it, you sell it. this blackened wool, this sorrow seed. translated from the old english  
NEW POEM
 lockers, metal detectors, steel doors, c.o. to c.o., different forms, desks—mouth open, turn—so slow i use the time to practice patience, grace, tenderness for glassed-in guards. the rules recited as if they were the same rules every week: i can wear earrings. i cannot wear earrings. i can wear my hair up. i cannot wear my hair up. i dressed by rote: cords in blue or brown, grey turtleneck, black clogs. the prisoners, all in grey sweatshirts, blue jeans, joked i looked like them, fit in. i didn't think about it, until i dreamed of being shuffled in and locked in there, hustled through the heavy doors. in the dream the guards just shook their heads, smirked when i spelled out my name, shook the freezing bars. instead of nightly escorts out, i'd stay in there forever. who would know? so i went to goodwill, spent ten bucks on pink angora, walked back down those halls a movie star. when i stood at the front of the class there rose a sharp collective sigh. the one who said she never heard of pandering until the arraignment said ok,i'm going to tell her. then she told me: freedom is wasted on women like me. they hate the dark cotton, jeans they have to wear, each one a shadow of the other their whole sentence.you could wear red! she accused. their favorite dresses, silk slips, wool socks all long gone, bagged up for sisters, moms—maybe goodwill, maybe i flicked past them looking for this cotton candy pink angora cardigan, pearl buttons. they can't stop staring, so i take it off and pass it around, let each woman hold it in her arms, appraise the wool between her fingers, a familiar gesture, second nature, from another world.  
NEW POEM
 one thing you know when you say it: all over the earth people are saying it with you; a child blurting it out as the seizures take her, a woman reciting it on a cot in a hospital. what if you take a cab through the tenderloin: at a street light, a man in a wool cap, yarn unraveling across his face, knocks at the window; he says,please. by the time you hear what he’s saying, the light changes, the cab pulls away, and you don’t go back, though you know someone just prayed to you the way you pray. please: a word so short it could get lost in the air as it floats up to god like the feather it is, knocking and knocking, and finally falling back to earth as rain, as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch, collecting in drains, leaching into the ground, and you walk in that weather every day.  
NEW POEM
 to be poor and raise skinny children. to own nothing but skinny clothing. skinny food falls in between cracks. friends cannot visit your skinny home. they cannot fit through the door. your skinny thoughts evaporate into the day or the night that you cannot see with your tiny eyes.  god sticks you with the smallest pins and your blood, the red is diluted. imagine a tiny hole, the other side of which is a fat world and how lost you would feel. of course, i’m speaking to myself. how lost i would feel, and how dangerous.  
NEW POEM
 say licked clean at birth. say weeping in the tall grass, where this tantalizing song begins, birds perched on a crooked branch over a grave of an unending trek into the valley of cooling waters. the soil’s thirst, lessons of earth unmoor the first tongue. say i have gone back, says the oracle, counting seasons &amp; centuries, undoing fault lines between one generation &amp; next, as she twirls sackcloth edged with pollen, &amp; one glimpses what one did not know. say this is where the goat spoke legends ago in the ring of fire to deliver a sacrifice. to feel signs depends on how &amp; why the singer’s song puckers the mouth. well, i believe the borrowed rib story is the other way round, entangled in decree, blessing, law &amp; myth. one only has to listen to nightlong pleas of a mother who used all thousand chants &amp; prayers of clay, red ocher blown from the mouth onto the high stone wall, retracing land bridge to wishbone. my own two daughters &amp; granddaughter, the three know how to work praise &amp; lament, ready to sprout wings of naked flight &amp; labor. yes, hinged into earth, we rose from lucy to clan, from clan to tribe, &amp; today we worship her sun-polished bones, remembering she is made of questions. no, mama is not always the first word before counting eggs in the cowbird’s nest. it begins in memory. now, say her name, say dinknesh, mother of us all.

 1  an old man bending i come among new faces, years looking backward resuming in answer to children, come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me, (arous’d and angry, i’d thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war, but soon my fingers fail’d me, my face droop’d and i resign’d myself, to sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;) years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances, of unsurpass’d heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;) now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth, of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us? what stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics, of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?   2  o maidens and young men i love and that love me, what you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls, soldier alert i arrive after a long march cover’d with sweat and dust, in the nick of time i come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge, enter the captur’d works—yet lo, like a swift running river they fade, pass and are gone they fade—i dwell not on soldiers’ perils or soldiers’ joys, (both i remember well—many of the hardships, few the joys, yet i was content.)  but in silence, in dreams’ projections, while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on, so soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand, with hinged knees returning i enter the doors, (while for you up there, whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)  bearing the bandages, water and sponge, straight and swift to my wounded i go, where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in, where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground, or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof’d hospital, to the long rows of cots up and down each side i return, to each and all one after another i draw near, not one do i miss, an attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail, soon to be fill’d with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill’d again.  i onward go, i stop, with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds, i am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable, one turns to me his appealing eyes—poor boy! i never knew you, yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.   3  on, on i go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!) the crush’d head i dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,) the neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through i examine, hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard, (come sweet death! be persuaded o beautiful death! in mercy come quickly.)  from the stump of the arm, the amputated hand, i undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood, back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv’d neck and side falling head, his eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump, and has not yet look’d on it.  i dress a wound in the side, deep, deep, but a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking, and the yellow-blue countenance see.  i dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound, cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive, while the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.  i am faithful, i do not give out, the fractur’d thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen, these and more i dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame.)   4  thus in silence in dreams’ projections, returning, resuming, i thread my way through the hospitals, the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand, i sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young, some suffer so much, i recall the experience sweet and sad, (many a soldier’s loving arms about this neck have cross’d and rested, many a soldier’s kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)

 oh fortune, thy wresting wavering state hath fraught with cares my troubled wit, whose witness this present prison late could bear, where once was joy’s loan quit. thou causedst the guilty to be loosed from bands where innocents were inclosed, and caused the guiltless to be reserved, and freed those that death had well deserved. but all herein can be nothing wrought, so god send to my foes all they have thought.

 port-au-prince girl on a heap of street sweepings high as a pyre, laid on snarled wire &amp; dented rim. girl set down among the wrung-out hides. a girl who was coming from church. it is late sunday afternoon.was it a seizure? is it destiny or bad luck we should fear? weak heart  or swerving taxi? in tet bef by the dirty ocean thousands crush past her without pausing at the shrine of her spayed limbs; brilliance like the flesh of lilies sprouting from the pummeled cane. is it possible to be lighthearted, hours later? days? to forget the yellow dress? i am waiting for her mother to find her, still wearing one white spotless glove (where is the other?), my idle taxi level with her unbruised arm, her fingers just curling like petals of a fallen flower and how did it end? let someone have gathered her up before the stars assembled coldly overhead: her dress brighter than gold, crocus, the yolk of an egg her face covered like the bride of a god; let them have found her &amp; borne her though the traffic's clamor veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.

 you love a woman and you wonder where she goes all night in some tricked- out taxicab, with her high heels and her corset and her big, fat mouth.  you love how she only wears her glasses with you, how thick and cow-eyed she swears it’s only ever you she wants to see.  you love her, you want her very ugly. if she is lovely big, you want her scrawny. if she is perfect lithe, you want her ballooned, a cosmonaut.  how not to love her, her bouillabaisse, her orangina. when you took her to the doctor the doctor said, “wow, look at that!” and you were proud,  you asshole, you love and that’s how you are in love. any expert, observing human bodies, can see how she’s exceptional, how she ruins us all.  but you really love this woman, how come no one can see this? everyone must become suddenly very clumsy at recognizing beauty if you are to keep her.  you don’t want to lose anything, at all, ever. you want her sex depilated, you want everyone else not blind, but perhaps paralyzed, from the eyes down.  you wonder where she goes all night. if she leaves you, you will know everything about love. if she’s leaving you now, you already know it.

 people, don't ask me again where my shoes are. the valley i walked through was frozen to me as i was to it. my heavy hide, my zinc talisman—i'm fine, people. don't stare at my feet. and don't flash the sign of the cross in my face. i carry the blue cross card— card among cards, card of my number and gold seal. so shall ye know i am of the system, in the beast's belly and up to here, people, with your pity.  people, what is wrong with you? i don't care what the sign on your door says. i will go to another door. i will knock and rattle and if you won't, then surely someone, somewhere, will put a pancake in my hand.  you people of the rhetorical huh? you lords and ladies of the blooming stump, i bend over you, taste you, keep an eye on you, dream for you the beginning of what you may one day dream an end to.  the new century peeled me bone-bare like a first song inside a warbler—that bird, people, who knows not to go where the sky's stopped. keep this in mind. do you think the fox won't find your nest? that the egg of you will endure the famine?  you, you people born of moons with no mother-planets, you who are back-lit, who have no fathers in heaven, hear now the bruise-knuckled knock of me. i am returned.  from your alley. from your car up on blocks. from the battered, graffitied railcars that uncouple and move out into the studded green lightning.  dare you trust any longer the chained-up dogs of hell not to bust free? or that because your youth's been ransacked, nothing more will be asked of you? if a bloody foot's dragged across your coiffed lawn— do not confuse me with dawn.  now people, about the shoes: the shoes have no doubt entered the sea and are by now walking the ramparts of atlantis. i may be a false prophet, but god bless me, at least i have something to say. i lay myself down in a pencil of night—no chiseled tip yet, but the marks already forming in the lead.

 he was a big man, says the size of his shoes on a pile of broken dishes by the house; a tall man too, says the length of the bed in an upstairs room; and a good, god-fearing man, says the bible with a broken back on the floor below the window, dusty with sun; but not a man for farming, say the fields cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.  a woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves covered with oilcloth, and they had a child, says the sandbox made from a tractor tire. money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole. and the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames. it was lonely here, says the narrow country road.  something went wrong, says the empty house in the weed-choked yard. stones in the fields say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste. and the child? its toys are strewn in the yard like branches after a storm—a rubber cow, a rusty tractor with a broken plow, a doll in overalls. something went wrong, they say.  
NEW POEM
 identification is a highly important factor in the mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled in their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the experiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it were, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by means of their own personalities alone. — sigmund freud anne identified with cate until it became a bona fide illness, for boris had left cate, resulting not only in psychic estrangement but an unconscious stream  of hostility directed not at boris, but at his new woman, anne, whom cate viewed as her rival. cate remained excessively tender with boris, though cate, for him,  had been a “totem animal” from which he gained power by “eating.” whereas boris was the patriarch, anne was the ego alien; and whereas cate was anne’s  fixation, anne was no one’s obsession, so she was admitted to a psychiatric ward with the unbidden associations she could not be induced to abandon.  on the rare occasions she slept, the manifest and latent content of her dreams was the dance of abandonment between boris and cate, which anne, in her waking hours,  projected onto the walls, as though screening a silent film. she could not be induced to abandon this footage; she could not be induced to abandon her object love  of boris (whose own object choice was his ego-libido); or her identification with cate, who felt no friendship towards anne. soon anne drew a mental  triangle on every surface she saw, be it phallic or concave, and sometimes this triangle was isosceles, sometimes it was equilateral, and often it was right.

NEW POEM
 i  along the wilderness road, through cumberland gap, the black ox hours limped toward sunday’s sun, across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone, where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush from february’s fang and claw; the stars, blue white, like sheer icicles, spired aglow as if the three wise men barged in the east or priests in sackcloth balked the scourge of god.  foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law, the scrubby log cabin dared the compass points of rock spring farm, man’s world, god’s universe, the babel of the circumstance and era. the frozen socket of its window stared beyond the spayed crabapple trees, to where the skulls of hills, the skeletons of barrens, lay quiet as time without the watch’s tick.  not knowing muck and star would vie for him, the man tom sank upon ax-split stool, hands fisted, feet set wide to brace the spirit, big shoulders shoved, dark hazel eyes glazed by grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced up, up, the stick-clay chimney. while fire imps combed the black and bristling hair, the acids of thoughts made of the orby face an etching-plate.   ii  near pyrotechnic logs, the purling kettle, aunt peggy puffed her pipe on god’s rich time: a granny at a childbed on the border, where head and backbone answered the tomahawk her wise old eyes had seen a hundred nancys in travail tread the dark winepress alone; her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed into the outer world of pitch and toss.  the cabin that her myth and mission entered became a castle in which aunt peggy throned a dynasty of grunts and nods and glances. the nest, the barn, the hovel had schooled her in the abc of motherhood, and somehow she’d lost her ego in the commonweal: she sensed so accurately a coming child that rakes dubbed her the st. bernard of sex!  and now her keyhole look explored tom lincoln beneath the patched homespun, the hue and cry of malice, until she touched his loneliness, the taproot that his fiber gave no tongue. then, lulling the wife, troubled in flesh and mind, she eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while: there’s but one way of coming into the world, and seven times seventy ways of leaving it!   iii  the woman nancy, like a voyager sucked into the sea’s whale belly by a wreck, buoyed to the surface air of consciousness and clutched the solace of her corn-husk bed. her dark face, sharped in forehead, cheekbone, chin, cuddled in dark brown hair; her eyes waxed grayer with wonder of the interlude: her beauty and courage choked aunt peggy’s hyperbole!  out of the fog of pain, the bog of bygones, the bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle, she picked the squares to piece tomorrow’s quilt: she puzzled now, as then, about her father who let wild lucy hanks bundle and carry flesh of his flesh beyond the cumberland gap; a strange roof is no roof when imps of fear pilfer the fatherless in blossom time.  year in, year out, the daughter tinkered with the riddle of her birth; the mother chided the woman nancy as she had the child, “hush thee, hush thee, thy father’s a gentleman.” the butt of bawd, grand jury, sunday bonnet, lucy, driven, taught her daughter the word, and nancy, driven, taught her son the word, and abraham, driven, taught his people the word!   iv  the man tom bit his fingernails, then rammed his pockets with the hector hands that gave raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin, and in his lame speech said: “aunt peggy, listen, now that our nancy’s time is come, i’m haunted by my own nothingness. why breed nobodies?” he tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot that aided fist and skull in border fights.  aunt peggy counseled: “tom, you say the say poor joseph probably said in that low stable ere jesus came into this mishmash world.” she paused, then boxed the ears of cynicism: “it’s true, down in the barnyard, blood speaks loud, among the hogs, the chickens, the cows, the horses; but, when it comes to man, who knows, who knows what greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother?”  the man tom turned and spat: his naked surmise ranged out and out. aunt peggy’s innermost said: “your father abraham, bred like daniel boone, conquered a land with gun and ax and plow, baptized it in his blood! i say, i’ve said, what’s in a baby is god almighty’s business; how the elders wring it out is worry enough! the best, the worst—it’s all, all human nature.”   v  the tavern, tom remembered, the new year’s eve, the clubfoot scholar bagged in old world clothes, with arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard. an oxford don, he hymned the bastille’s fall in spite of the hair-hung sword; his betters set him free to hail new truths in new lands, where he seined with slave and master, knave and priest, and out of all fished up the rights of man:  “as citizen lincoln asks, ‘what’s human nature?’ his full mug says a clear mind puts the question which ties the fogey scholar in a knot! my new idea fed to his new baby would fetch the new world and the new year peace! the sum of anything unriddles the riddle: the child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind.  “to make a new world and a new year, plato and jesus begged the boon of little children! now citizen lincoln asks, ‘what’s human nature?’ it’s what we elders have: no baby has it. it’s what our good and bad graft on the neutral. it’s what our rulers feed the boy and girl. it’s what society garbs nature in. it’s a misnomer: call it human nurture!”   vi  aunt peggy hovered closer, with flawless rites grown lyrical from habit: muffled pain sounds dragged from the bed of cleated poles; she hawed tom lincoln, as one turns a nag aside, then swooped her way, even as a setting hen carves a dictatorship from yard to nest. and tom again was squeezed into a cell whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess.  later his memories climbed a gala peak, his nancy’s infare that ran riotous: the bear meat, venison, wild turkey, duck, the maple sugar hanging for the whiskey, the red ham, gourds of syrup, bowls of honey, the wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep, the guzzling, fiddling, guttling, monkeyshining: a continent sprawled between that day and this!  a havenot on the frontier is no havenot; a crusoe without friday has no conscience: yet tom’s grub living gnawed him like the teeth of slavery, land titles, melancholy. he, like his forebears, visioned a promised land and tidied ways and means to fly the barrens that doomed the flesh to peck, to patch, to pinch, and wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry.   vii  the black ox hours limped by, and day crawled after. white prongs of ice, like dinosaur fangs, gleamed in the cavernous mouth of rock spring; snowbirds shivered and chirped rebellion; a cow with jags and gaps chewed emptily; hogs squealed in hunger fits; and scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney, which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert.  nancy lay white, serene, like virgin milk after the udder’s fury in the pail. beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe, in yellow petticoat and linsey shirt, the baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled— an anonymity of soft red wrinkles. aunt peggy, hovering, grinned, “he’s sabbath-born. remember …sunday—it’s red-letter day!”  like ax and helve, like scythe and snath, the bond held tom and nancy; she smiled at his halt smile, his titan’s muss in picking up the baby. tom frowned and spat, then gulped, “he’s legs! all legs!” aunt peggy beamed, “long legs can eat up miles.” tom gloomed, “the hands—look at the axman’s hands!” and nancy mused, “the hankses’ dream, the lincolns’, needs such a man to hew and blaze the way.”

 we chose this animal to be our pet. his indifference allowed us to sleep.  cat, who made your ears bend back, who made you lazy as quick?  who made you work? it is a wonder any sun is left.  still it is always so abrupt. sleep like an umbrella going up,  clumsy like a broken umbrella coming down, this waking, and into what?  i did not ask to be afraid. i did not ask for pleasure, but there it was,  it exfoliated at its own leisure, grew until it was all that was—  the brief interruption of who i am interrupts and punctuates the day  i always assumed that i would share— cat who cut the sun down from the sky  and then responsible put it up again? there must be one of us that you prefer.

 i wish we could control this revolting want of control: these people with their spongy eyes, their mouths of trembling shoehorns, billhooks for penises and bear traps for vulvas. one taste of sunlight and at once they can’t do without it. water, the same, and food, and air, and a dozen other squalid habits. some—like their copulation, a rusting carnation in a cut-glass neck— are not physically compulsive but the partners can’t stop wanting them to be: so we desire to be raped by love, who would fill us, they say, with an oil from the lit braziers of stars. what if, doing it every day, we resemble pistons, and the slow poison cuts our lives off at 70: it’s the grim determination of our passion. and beyond this, even i— defended in childhood by my strong father the piano and my mother the virtuoso from knuckles among warehouses—even i am addicted to the mild light of words.  
NEW POEM
 the turtle carries his house on his back. he is both the house and the person of that house. but actually, under the shell is a little room where the true turtle, wearing long underwear, sits at a little table. at one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor, like the controls of a steam shovel. it is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house. most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns. he leans on one elbow, and then the other. he crosses one leg, and then the other. finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps. if he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape. if he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits. he knows that children are careless, and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place, where he will relight his candle, take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns. then he’ll bury his head in his arms and sleep....that is, until another child picks up his house....

 dawn on the black hill, and up on the roof cats drowsing. last night, there was a boy who fell off this roof, breaking his back. the wind riffles the cool leaves of the trees. the red clouds above are warm and move slowly. a stray dog appears in the alley below, sniffing the boy on the cobblestones, and a raw wail rises up among chimneys: someone’s unhappy.  the crickets were singing all night, and the stars were blown out by the wind. in dawn’s glow, even the eyes of the cats in love were extinguished, the cats the boy watched. the female is crying, no toms are around and nothing can soothe her: not the tops of the trees, not the red clouds. she cries to the wide sky, as if it were still night.  the boy was spying on cats making love. the stray dog sniffs the boy’s body and growls; he got here at dawn, fleeing the glow that crept down the far hill. swimming the river that drenched him as dew drenches fields, he was finally caught by the light. the bitches were still howling. the river runs smoothly, skimmed by birds that drop from red clouds, elated to find their river deserted.

 their jeans sparkled, cut off way above the knee, and my friends and i would watch them from my porch, books of poems lost in our laps, eyes wide as tropical fish behind our glasses.  their football flashed from hand to hand, tennis shoes gripped the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on their strong backs. we would dream of hugging them, and crouch later in weird rooms, and come.  once their ball fell our way so two of them came over, hands on their hips, asking us to throw it to them, which arthur did, badly, and they chased it back. one turned to yell, “thanks”  and we dreamed of his long teeth in our necks. we wanted them to wander over, place deep wet underarms to our lips, and then their white asses, then those loud mouths.  one day one guy was very tired, didn't move fast enough, so a car hit him and he sprawled fifty feet away, sexy, but he was dead, blood like lipstick, then those great boys stood together  on the sidewalk and we joined them, mixing in like one big friendship to the cops, who asked if we were, and those boys were too sad to counter. we'd known his name, tim, and how he'd turned to thank us nicely  but now he was under a sheet anonymous as god, the big boys crying, spitting words, and we stunned like intellectuals get, our high voices soft as the tinkling of a chandelier on a ceiling too high to see.

 my hands hold, my father’s older the wires– picture rolls once, then steadies… an english castle! a voice-over drones about edward i, who, to subdue the welsh, built castles. some sixty years, dozens of engineers, the masses conscripted from the villages.  my father moves on to a zenith with a bad tuner. tvs interest him, not english with their damp, historical programming.  *    *   *  here there were indians, mound builders. here, an english fort, a few farmers. and here the industrialist settled his ass, john ford on the river dredging sand for making glass. plate glass. (why should america buy from europe?) some half dozen years, german engineers, and hundreds of slavic peasants.  grandfather sat on his samovar warming himself and making excuses, but finally, he set off. got a room, became a shoveler. got a wife, a company house. ford city: a valley filling with properties.  no one got along– not labor and capital, not germans and slavs, not husband and wives, for that matter.  *    *   *  edward’s castles were ruins by the fifteenth century. not from welsh armies, but the rise of the middle class. the towns around a castle thrived: tailors, smithies, cobblers, coopers. drawing in the welsh peasants. and what with intermarriage and the rise of capitalism… a castle grew obsolescent.  i turn off the set. my father hunts cigarettes at the kwik-mart on the corner. overhead, my mother’s footsteps, the tonk of bottles, the scraping of plates.  *    *   *  during eisenhower’s reign my grandfather retired and mowed his lawn until i took over. he primed the filter, set the choke, then we took turns pulling till the sputtering engine caught. (“somanabitch,” he spit) and watched me as i mowed back and forth for two dollars.  once in the garage he showed me a scythe. he mowed hay in the old country, and the women would follow, raking it in windrows.  *    *   *  the factories today are mostly closed down, or full of robots or far off in asia. ford city lives through the mail: compensation, a thin pension, and, of course, social security.  i always drive along the factory, windows rolled down; i want my kids in the back seat to see. seven or eight, probably pensioners, congregate on the corner, each man dressed quite alike: sears jacket, cigarette, salt-and-pepper hair.  “honk the horn,” my oldest begs. he waves and waves zealously until a man turns–a man with my face, but full of sweetness now, silence and clarity.

 dropping napkins, corks, and non-compostables into the trash, i see that friends have mistaken my everyday chopsticks for disposables,  helpfully discarding them alongside inedibles: pork bones, shrimp shells, bitter melon. among napkins and corks, they do look compostable:  off-white, wooden, warped from continual washing — no lacquer, no ornament. but anyone who thinks these chopsticks are disposable  doesn’t live with chopsticks in the comfortable way of a favorite robe, oversized, a bit broken. thin paper napkins, plastic forks, and non-compostable  takeout boxes constitute the chopstick’s natural habitat to many i hold dear. with family or alone, i’ll maintain that chopsticks aren’t disposable,  but if i can make peace with the loss of utensils when breaking bao with guests, i’ll be one of them, not digging in the napkins and corks. compostable chopsticks are the answer: everyday and disposable.

 new year’s morning— everything is in blossom! i feel about average.  a huge frog and i staring at each other, neither of us moves.  this moth saw brightness in a woman’s chamber— burned to a crisp.  asked how old he was the boy in the new kimono stretched out all five fingers.  blossoms at night, like people moved by music  napped half the day; no one punished me!  fiftieth birthday:  from now on, it’s all clear profit, every sky.  don’t worry, spiders, i keep house casually.  these sea slugs, they just don’t seem japanese.  hell:  bright autumn moon; pond snails crying in the saucepan.

 i carved upon my desk unsayables. he drank until he vomited on himself. eavesdropping, the others resisted sleep. the house knew the pain of sun on lacquered floorboards.  i carved it with the tips of scissors. a door creaked; he hung his head into the room. please, the others cannot sleep. the shingles twitched like skin beneath moonlight.  i spent the afternoon at a movie theater. he staggered through brush toward a pay phone. the others continued searching the streets for him. the house held the moon above it, it was that imperial.  i recall the room was empty when i came back in. he was arrested at the quik-trip while calling collect. frantic, the others circled the block again. the house was ghost-white, older than the dead.  i needle-pointed for 72 hours straight. he claimed the whole situation humiliated him. relieved, the others refrained from asking him what jail was like. the house was swan to field, tiger to sea.  i lay in bed by the time the others came home. he couldn't recall putting on the orange jumpsuit. the others asked if i'd seen him around. the house shuddered,no-o-o-o.  the house winced, winked its blinds. the house whispered i should stay inside. the others flew out the doors and into their cars. the others slammed their cars into deer and cried.  he was more humiliated than he'd ever been. he looked more or less the same, though his eyes were ringed. the others hid in the basement. he climbed the stairs and presented a ring.  the house swung its windows wide to ice. he banged his nails blue, pinned his tongue to his tie. he packed himself in a box, sent it to regions far off. the others pressed their ears to the pipes.  the house wore its flames like a hat. the house called a radio talk-show. we drank all night, laughed all night, the night he left. i shook in its mouth till the house drank me up.

 may 3, 1863 when clifford wasn’t back to camp by nine, i went to look among the fields of dead before we lost him to a common grave. but i kept tripping over living men and had to stop and carry them to help or carry them until they died, which happened more than once upon my back. and i got angry with those men because they kept me from my search and i was out still stumbling through the churned-up earth at dawn, stopping to stare into each corpse’s face, and all the while i was writing in my head the letter i would have to send our father, saying clifford was lost and i had lost him.  i found him bent above a dying squirrel while trying to revive the little thing. a battlefield is full of trash like that — dead birds and squirrels, bits of uniform. its belly racked for air. it couldn’t live. cliff knew it couldn’t live without a jaw. when in relief i called his name, he stared, jumped back, and hissed at me like a startled cat. i edged up slowly, murmuring “clifford, cliff,” as you might talk to calm a skittery mare, and then i helped him kill and bury all the wounded squirrels he’d gathered from the field. it seemed a game we might have played as boys. we didn’t bury them all at once, with lime, the way they do on burial detail, but scooped a dozen, tiny, separate graves. when we were done he fell across the graves and sobbed as though they’d been his unborn sons. his chest was large — it covered most of them. i wiped his tears and stroked his matted hair, and as i hugged him to my chest i saw he’d wet his pants. we called it yankee tea.  
NEW POEM
 i’ll go among the dead to see my friend. the place i leave is beautiful: the sea repeats the winds’ far swell in its long sound, and, there beside it, houses solemnly shine with the modest courage of the land, while swimmers try the verge of what they see.  i cannot go, although i should pretend some final self whose phantom eye could see him who because he is not cannot change. and yet the thought of going makes the sea, the land, the swimmers, and myself seem strange, almost as strange as they will someday be.  
NEW POEM
 this room, how well i know it. now they’re renting it, and the one next to it, as offices. the whole house has become an office building for agents, businessmen, companies.  this room, how familiar it is.  the couch was here, near the door, a turkish carpet in front of it. close by, the shelf with two yellow vases. on the right—no, opposite—a wardrobe with a mirror. in the middle the table where he wrote, and the three big wicker chairs. beside the window the bed where we made love so many times.  they must still be around somewhere, those old things.  beside the window the bed; the afternoon sun used to touch half of it.  . . . one afternoon at four o’clock we separated for a week only. . . and then— that week became forever.  
NEW POEM
 reading what i have just written, i now believe i stopped precipitously, so that my story seems to have been slightly distorted, ending, as it did, not abruptly but in a kind of artificial mist of the sort sprayed onto stages to allow for difficult set changes.  why did i stop? did some instinct discern a shape, the artist in me intervening to stop traffic, as it were?  a shape. or fate, as the poets say, intuited in those few long ago hours—  i must have thought so once. and yet i dislike the term which seems to me a crutch, a phase, the adolescence of the mind, perhaps—  still, it was a term i used myself, frequently to explain my failures. fate, destiny, whose designs and warnings now seem to me simply local symmetries, metonymic baubles within immense confusion—  chaos was what i saw. my brush froze—i could not paint it.  darkness, silence: that was the feeling.  what did we call it then? a “crisis of vision” corresponding, i believed, to the tree that confronted my parents,  but whereas they were forced forward into the obstacle, i retreated or fled—  mist covered the stage (my life). characters came and went, costumes were changed, my brush hand moved side to side far from the canvas, side to side, like a windshield wiper.  surely this was the desert, the dark night. (in reality, a crowded street in london, the tourists waving their colored maps.)  one speaks a word:i. out of this stream the great forms—  i took a deep breath. and it came to me the person who drew that breath was not the person in my story, his childish hand confidently wielding the crayon—  had i been that person? a child but also an explorer to whom the path is suddenly clear, for whom the vegetation parts—  and beyond, no longer screened from view, that exalted solitude kant perhaps experienced on his way to the bridges— (we share a birthday.)  outside, the festive streets were strung, in late january, with exhausted christmas lights. a woman leaned against her lover’s shoulder singing jacques brel in her thin soprano—  bravo! the door is shut. now nothing escapes, nothing enters—  i hadn’t moved. i felt the desert stretching ahead, stretching (it now seems) on all sides, shifting as i speak,  so that i was constantly face to face with blankness, that stepchild of the sublime,  which, it turns out, has been both my subject and my medium.  what would my twin have said, had my thoughts reached him?  perhaps he would have said in my case there was no obstacle (for the sake of argument) after which i would have been referred to religion, the cemetery where questions of faith are answered.  the mist had cleared. the empty canvases were turned inward against the wall.  the little cat is dead(so the song went).  shall i be raised from death, the spirit asks. and the sun says yes. and the desert answers your voice is sand scattered in wind.  
NEW POEM
 i realise it’s not all salad sandwiches at pinewood picnics, endless volleyball. i’ve heard the argument that talk of shame and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty; how we've all got one. seen one, seen ’em all.  but it’s not for me, beneath my double load of calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies. for me, i have to see the clothes come off: the way a button’s thumbed through cotton cloth - a winning move in some exotic game  with no set rules but countless permutations - or how a summer dress falls to the floor with momentary mass and with a plash that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion; a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip,  three fingertips that follow down the spine to where a clasp is neatly spun undone amidkiss, by prime legerdemain and who cares that it happens once in four and never, never on the first undressing,  it must be better than a foreskin snagged on gorse thorns or a cold, fat nipple jammed in the scissor drawer, the bounty and the blessing, the mystery of nakedness reduced till on a par with go-go palaces  where goosebumped, grinding strippers strut their stuff in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses, down on a par with the oncologist who gropes for lumps, the night-morgue man who clips his nails amongst the naked, bin-bagged stiffs.  so, stranger, what i want to say is this: if you’re to join me in a little sinning (and this is my place up here on the right), please understand i’d value some reluctance, a cold-feet shiver, as in the beginning  when eve discovered modesty and slipped in and out of something comfortable. for there are many ways to skin a cat, but ours is human nature - things come off so rarely. come in. let me take your coat.

 twice or thrice had i lov'd thee, before i knew thy face or name; so in a voice, so in a shapeless flame angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be; still when, to where thou wert, i came, some lovely glorious nothing i did see. but since my soul, whose child love is, takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do, more subtle than the parent is love must not be, but take a body too; and therefore what thou wert, and who, i bid love ask, and now that it assume thy body, i allow, and fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.  whilst thus to ballast love i thought, and so more steadily to have gone, with wares which would sink admiration, i saw i had love's pinnace overfraught; ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon is much too much, some fitter must be sought; for, nor in nothing, nor in things extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere; then, as an angel, face, and wings of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear, so thy love may be my love's sphere; just such disparity as is 'twixt air and angels' purity, 'twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.

 i’m back again scrutinizing the milky way of your ultrasound, scanning the dark matter, the nothingness, that now the heads say is chockablock with quarks and squarks, gravitons and gravatini, photons and photinos. our sprout,  who art there inside the spacecraft of your ma, the time capsule of this printout, hurling and whirling towards us, it’s all daft on this earth. our alien who art in the heavens, our martian, our little green man, we’re anxious  to make contact, to ask divers questions about the heavendom you hail from, to discuss the whole shebang of the beginning and end, the pre-big bang untime before you forget the why and lie of thy first place. and, our friend,  to say welcome, that we mean no harm, we’d die for you even, that we pray you’re not here to subdue us, that we’d put away our ray guns, missiles, attitude and share our world with you, little big head, if only you stay.

 three people drinking out of the bottle in the living room. a cold rain. quiet as a mirror.  one of the men stuffs his handkerchief in his coat, climbs the stairs with the girl. the other man is left sitting  at the desk with the wine and the headache, turning an old ellington side over in his mind. and over.  he held her like a saxophone when she was his girl. her tongue trembling at the reed.  the man lying next to her now thinks of another woman. her white breath idling  before he drove off. he said something about a spell, watching the snow fall on her shoulders.  the musician crawls back into his horn, ancient terrapin at the approach of the wheel.  
NEW POEM
 1    in the forest of    wearisome sadness, where one day i found myself wandering alone, i met my heart, who called to me, asking me where i was going.  the path was long and straight, row after row of conifers receding to a horizon that because of   the geometry seemed farther than it really was, like the door at the top of a staircase in versailles.  but as if   the forest’s maker had been offended by elegance, a pile of rocks disrupted the rows: the forest once had been a field. i remember that field.  i was carried there by my father, beside him my grandfather, who planted the trees. until they were tall enough to survive, he mowed the field, piling up rocks, taking down brush with a scythe.  how, since i’ve known the forest almost since birth, could i have been lost? why, since the forest is beautiful, is it not a place of delight?  repeatedly i asked these questions of my heart, but like a good physician, he elected to keep silent, leaving me to answer for myself.     2   late at night, when i’m lying in bed and cannot sleep, my heart reads to me from the romance of   pleasant thought. always i’ve heard the story before, and typically, since the stories are true, i am their hero.  i’m riding my tricycle on the sidewalk near the house where i was born. because i am unsupervised, i indulge in what seems at the moment a daring wish: i ride the tricycle beneath a sprinkler.  immediately i am overcome with remorse. the evidence of my trespass is everywhere to be seen, and for the first time in my life i contemplate a lie.  would my shirt dry faster if i stood in the sun, where it’s hot, or in the shade, where cool breezes rustle the leaves?  in the version of this story that appears now in the romance of pleasant thought, i admire not so much my ingenuity as the evidence of my early devotion to empiricism, the way i manage terror by examining how things work.      3   it’s done, there’s nothing more to say. my heart is gone from me. because he has fallen in love he has abandoned me.  it’s pointless making myself uncomfortable over this by being mournful or sad. it’s done, there’s nothing more to say. my heart is gone from me.  he does nothing but mock me. when i tell him pitifully that i cannot live on my own, he does not listen. it’s done, there’s nothing more to say.  after charles d’orleans

 near the camp was a river and in our house were absentees and hands that will one day wake us in vain  i had just turned seven while he was sitting in the shade ironing his clothes the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders  i paid no attention to the road or the three steps and didn't notice the carpet  i don't remember who was it that said to me or to another "when you grow up poetry will become your house"  the dust that eats the memories always distances those folks  yet their chairs appear from afar, from behind the hills and over the houses, to hang in an air of summer and holm oak, those shaded chairs that reach the heart on shoulders topped with five flowers  which flowers are speech which flowers are silence?  and i can't remember whether it was my uncle who stood at the door, whether we had palm and lotus trees in our house in karameh,  whether my mother who gave birth to me on the shelf was folding our clothes behind our father's back so he could sleep  the watchdogs used to cry from the heat, and poetry, husseini of jerusalem, and khidr the mystic were all in our house as was my uncle who came from a pond within hebron's walls  twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us we have grown older and that's that  my father used to discompose his friends with his days, and women with the thread of seduction in his voice as he would sprinkle chatter in their rivers while walking about here or there with a lilt, he'd let his days fall off him and let others gather them as he walked on gold that came only for him  and i can't remember: in our courtyard there were holm oaks, a fountain, a tiled floor by a huge door, we were confused and in a hurry  the closet that faced us in the second room had a mirror the mirror we now seek  and my father was standing alone in the hall that led the stairs to the roof thanking his days or preparing for wednesday's nap or thursday's morning as he left, among the things he'd leave, the water can full of water while around his chairs our saturdays rose  my father didn't want too much from life: a house, five boys who don't mess with his papers, which were already chaos, and two girls so that braids could float all around the house

 a flower needs to be this size to conceal the winter window, and this color, the red of a fiat with the top down, to impress us, dull as we've grown.  months ago the gigantic onion of a bulb half above the soil stuck out its green tongue and slowly, day by day, the flower itself entered our world,  closed, like hands that captured a moth, then open, as eyes open, and the amaryllis, seeing us, was somehow undiscouraged. it stands before us now  as we eat our soup; you pour a little of your drinking water into its saucer, and a few crumbs of fragrant earth fall onto the tabletop.  
NEW POEM
 i. although tía miriam boasted she discovered at least half a dozen uses for peanut butter— topping for guava shells in syrup, butter substitute for cuban toast, hair conditioner and relaxer— mamá never knew what to make of the monthly five-pound jars handed out by the immigration department until my friend, jeff, mentioned jelly.   ii. there was always pork though, for every birthday and wedding, whole ones on christmas and new year’s eve, even on thanksgiving day—pork, fried, broiled, or crispy skin roasted— as well as cauldrons of black beans, fried plantain chips, and yuca con mojito. these items required a special visit to antonio’s mercado on the corner of eighth street where men in guayaberas stood in senate blaming kennedy for everything—“ese hijo de puta!” the bile of cuban coffee and cigar residue filling the creases of their wrinkled lips; clinging to one another’s lies of lost wealth, ashamed and empty as hollow trees.  iii. by seven i had grown suspicious—we were still here. overheard conversations about returning had grown wistful and less frequent. i spoke english; my parents didn’t. we didn’t live in a two-story house with a maid or a wood-panel station wagon nor vacation camping in colorado. none of the girls had hair of gold; none of my brothers or cousins were named greg, peter, or marcia; we were not the brady bunch. none of the black and white characters on donna reed or on the dick van dyke show were named guadalupe, lázaro, or mercedes. patty duke’s family wasn’t like us either— they didn’t have pork on thanksgiving, they ate turkey with cranberry sauce; they didn’t have yuca, they had yams like the dittos of pilgrims i colored in class.  iv. a week before thanksgiving i explained to my abuelita about the indians and the mayflower, how lincoln set the slaves free; i explained to my parents about the purple mountain’s majesty, “one if by land, two if by sea,” the cherry tree, the tea party, the amber waves of grain, the “masses yearning to be free,” liberty and justice for all, until finally they agreed: this thanksgiving we would have turkey, as well as pork.   v. abuelita prepared the poor fowl as if committing an act of treason, faking her enthusiasm for my sake. mamá set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven and prepared candied yams following instructions i translated from the marshmallow bag. the table was arrayed with gladiolas, the plattered turkey loomed at the center on plastic silver from woolworth’s. everyone sat in green velvet chairs we had upholstered with clear vinyl, except tío carlos and toti, seated in the folding chairs from the salvation army. i uttered a bilingual blessing and the turkey was passed around like a game of russian roulette. “dry,” tío berto complained, and proceeded to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings and cranberry jelly—“esa mierda roja,” he called it. faces fell when mamá presented her ochre pie— pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers, not a dessert. tía maría made three rounds of cuban coffee then abuelo and pepe cleared the living room furniture, put on a celia cruz lp and the entire family began to merengue over the linoleum of our apartment, sweating rum and coffee until they remembered— it was 1970 and 46 degrees— in américa. after repositioning the furniture, an appropriate darkness filled the room. tío berto was the last to leave.

 a picture from the life to serve with love, and shed your blood, approved may be above, but here below (example shew,) ‘tis dangerous to be good.  --lord oxford deep in a vale, a stranger now to arms, too poor to shine in courts, too proud to beg, he, who once warred on saratoga’s plains, sits musing o’er his scars, and wooden leg.  remembering still the toil of former days, to other hands he sees his earnings paid;-- they share the due reward—he feeds on praise. lost in the abyss of want, misfortune’s shade.  far, far from domes where splendid tapers glare, ‘tis his from dear bought peace no wealth to win, removed alike from courtly cringing ‘squires, the great-man’s levee, and the proud man’s grin.  sold are those arms which once on britons blazed, when, flushed with conquest, to the charge they came; that power repelled, and freedom’s fabrick raised, she leaves her soldier—famine and a name!

 “oh where are you going with your love-locks flowing on the west wind blowing along this valley track?” “the downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye, we shall escape the uphill by never turning back.”  so they two went together in glowing august weather, the honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right; and dear she was to dote on, her swift feet seemed to float on the air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.  “oh what is that in heaven where gray cloud-flakes are seven, where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?” “oh that’s a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous, an undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt.”  “oh what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly, their scent comes rich and sickly?”—“a scaled and hooded worm.” “oh what’s that in the hollow, so pale i quake to follow?” “oh that’s a thin dead body which waits the eternal term.”  “turn again, o my sweetest,—turn again, false and fleetest: this beaten way thou beatest i fear is hell’s own track.” “nay, too steep for hill-mounting; nay, too late for cost-counting: this downhill path is easy, but there’s no turning back.”

 i rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper. from the rock face footed a dancer white through red. my family gave me over to it, gone for the river.  were i a peasant harvesting grapes near beaune in the last century, even, i might have dreamed a saint lifting off for arles, les saintes maries de la mer,  and knowing about cannon in that long peace, might have been troubled therefore that my flier hauled a magnum of the best and bloodied the west sky with it  and vanished. my fisting that loose sheet in place was secretarial, not visionary! already in that decade small tribes entered the void  like windows on a skyscraper when the bent janitor makes his way. but those flick back on each night, costly difference. it is not only portents  in dream or flapping images of the gone or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised that catch like undertow the foot in tide-rip toeing  down the singing or remembered beach. we study populations in the forests, we hold the paper flat, mark, note, warn—the dictated  prophecies do their work, we do some work— cut horn from rhinos so they won’t be poached. but, to go on from there, one needs to stand in the doorway  some evening and feel the air as if it were fire pulling illusionlessly, letting the draw of one fact heat its chain of links, such as, japan  clear-cutting forests in siberia where tigers not already harvested lope their dwindling range, two hundred as the hinge  for their growled arc of existence, bones of the others ground to powders for old men’s potencies. one needs to feel the tug of the draft on skin, the drag  of process utterly anciently itself. faster, now, the pull is from birth through dwelling through dissolution, along lines streaming through us, ageless winds.

 the damp had got its grip years ago but gone unnoticed. the heads of the joists feathered slowly in the cavity wall and the room’s wet belly had begun to bow.  once we’d ripped the boards up, it all came out: the smell, at first, then the crumbling wood gone to seed, all its muscles wasted. you pottered back and to with tea, soda bread,  eighty years shaking on a plastic tray. one by one we looked up, nodded, then slipped under the floor. we moved down there like fish in moonlight, or divers round an old ship.

 but do not let us quarrel any more, no, my lucrezia; bear with me for once: sit down and all shall happen as you wish. you turn your face, but does it bring your heart? i'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, treat his own subject after his own way, fix his own time, accept too his own price, and shut the money into this small hand when next it takes mine. will it? tenderly? oh, i'll content him,—but to-morrow, love! i often am much wearier than you think, this evening more than usual, and it seems as if—forgive now—should you let me sit here by the window with your hand in mine and look a half-hour forth on fiesole, both of one mind, as married people use, quietly, quietly the evening through, i might get up to-morrow to my work cheerful and fresh as ever. let us try. to-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! your soft hand is a woman of itself, and mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve for each of the five pictures we require: it saves a model. so! keep looking so— my serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! —how could you ever prick those perfect ears, even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet— my face, my moon, my everybody's moon, which everybody looks on and calls his, and, i suppose, is looked on by in turn, while she looks—no one's: very dear, no less. you smile? why, there's my picture ready made, there's what we painters call our harmony! a common greyness silvers everything,— all in a twilight, you and i alike —you, at the point of your first pride in me (that's gone you know),—but i, at every point; my youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down to yonder sober pleasant fiesole. there's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; that length of convent-wall across the way holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; the last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, and autumn grows, autumn in everything. eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape as if i saw alike my work and self and all that i was born to be and do, a twilight-piece. love, we are in god's hand. how strange now, looks the life he makes us lead; so free we seem, so fettered fast we are! i feel he laid the fetter: let it lie! this chamber for example—turn your head— all that's behind us! you don't understand nor care to understand about my art, but you can hear at least when people speak: and that cartoon, the second from the door —it is the thing, love! so such things should be— behold madonna!—i am bold to say. i can do with my pencil what i know, what i see, what at bottom of my heart i wish for, if i ever wish so deep— do easily, too—when i say, perfectly, i do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, who listened to the legate's talk last week, and just as much they used to say in france. at any rate 'tis easy, all of it! no sketches first, no studies, that's long past: i do what many dream of, all their lives, —dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, and fail in doing. i could count twenty such on twice your fingers, and not leave this town, who strive—you don't know how the others strive to paint a little thing like that you smeared carelessly passing with your robes afloat,— yet do much less, so much less, someone says, (i know his name, no matter)—so much less! well, less is more, lucrezia: i am judged. there burns a truer light of god in them, in their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt this low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. their works drop groundward, but themselves, i know, reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, enter and take their place there sure enough, though they come back and cannot tell the world. my works are nearer heaven, but i sit here. the sudden blood of these men! at a word— praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. i, painting from myself and to myself, know what i do, am unmoved by men's blame or their praise either. somebody remarks morello's outline there is wrongly traced, his hue mistaken; what of that? or else, rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? speak as they please, what does the mountain care? ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for? all is silver-grey, placid and perfect with my art: the worse! i know both what i want and what might gain, and yet how profitless to know, to sigh "had i been two, another and myself, "our head would have o'erlooked the world!" no doubt. yonder's a work now, of that famous youth the urbinate who died five years ago. ('tis copied, george vasari sent it me.) well, i can fancy how he did it all, pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, above and through his art—for it gives way; that arm is wrongly put—and there again— a fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, its body, so to speak: its soul is right, he means right—that, a child may understand. still, what an arm! and i could alter it: but all the play, the insight and the stretch— (out of me, out of me! and wherefore out? had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, we might have risen to rafael, i and you! nay, love, you did give all i asked, i think— more than i merit, yes, by many times. but had you—oh, with the same perfect brow, and perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, and the low voice my soul hears, as a bird the fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare — had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! some women do so. had the mouth there urged "god and the glory! never care for gain.

"rafael is waiting: up to god, all three!" i might have done it for you. so it seems: perhaps not. all is as god over-rules. beside, incentives come from the soul's self; the rest avail not. why do i need you? what wife had rafael, or has agnolo? in this world, who can do a thing, will not; and who would do it, cannot, i perceive: yet the will's somewhat—somewhat, too, the power— and thus we half-men struggle. at the end, god, i conclude, compensates, punishes. 'tis safer for me, if the award be strict, that i am something underrated here, poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. i dared not, do you know, leave home all day, for fear of chancing on the paris lords. the best is when they pass and look aside; but they speak sometimes; i must bear it all. well may they speak! that francis, that first time, and that long festal year at fontainebleau! i surely then could sometimes leave the ground, put on the glory, rafael's daily wear, in that humane great monarch's golden look,— one finger in his beard or twisted curl over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, one arm about my shoulder, round my neck, the jingle of his gold chain in my ear, i painting proudly with his breath on me, all his court round him, seeing with his eyes, such frank french eyes, and such a fire of souls profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,— and, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, this in the background, waiting on my work, to crown the issue with a last reward! a good time, was it not, my kingly days? and had you not grown restless... but i know— 'tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said: too live the life grew, golden and not grey, and i'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt out of the grange whose four walls make his world. how could it end in any other way? you called me, and i came home to your heart. the triumph was—to reach and stay there; since i reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, you beautiful lucrezia that are mine! "rafael did this, andrea painted that; "the roman's is the better when you pray, "but still the other's virgin was his wife—" men will excuse me. i am glad to judge both pictures in your presence; clearer grows my better fortune, i resolve to think. for, do you know, lucrezia, as god lives, said one day agnolo, his very self, to rafael . . . i have known it all these years . . . (when the young man was flaming out his thoughts upon a palace-wall for rome to see, too lifted up in heart because of it) "friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub "goes up and down our florence, none cares how, "who, were he set to plan and execute "as you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, "would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!" to rafael's!—and indeed the arm is wrong. i hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see, give the chalk here—quick, thus, the line should go! ay, but the soul! he's rafael! rub it out! still, all i care for, if he spoke the truth, (what he? why, who but michel agnolo? do you forget already words like those?) if really there was such a chance, so lost,— is, whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased. well, let me think so. and you smile indeed! this hour has been an hour! another smile? if you would sit thus by me every night i should work better, do you comprehend? i mean that i should earn more, give you more. see, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, the cue-owls speak the name we call them by. come from the window, love,—come in, at last, inside the melancholy little house we built to be so gay with. god is just. king francis may forgive me: oft at nights when i look up from painting, eyes tired out, the walls become illumined, brick from brick distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, that gold of his i did cement them with! let us but love each other. must you go? that cousin here again? he waits outside? must see you—you, and not with me? those loans? more gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? while hand and eye and something of a heart are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? i'll pay my fancy. only let me sit the grey remainder of the evening out, idle, you call it, and muse perfectly how i could paint, were i but back in france, one picture, just one more—the virgin's face, not yours this time! i want you at my side to hear them—that is, michel agnolo— judge all i do and tell you of its worth. will you? to-morrow, satisfy your friend. i take the subjects for his corridor, finish the portrait out of hand—there, there, and throw him in another thing or two if he demurs; the whole should prove enough to pay for this same cousin's freak. beside, what's better and what's all i care about, get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! love, does that please you? ah, but what does he, the cousin! what does he to please you more?  i am grown peaceful as old age to-night. i regret little, i would change still less. since there my past life lies, why alter it? the very wrong to francis!—it is true i took his coin, was tempted and complied, and built this house and sinned, and all is said. my father and my mother died of want. well, had i riches of my own? you see how one gets rich! let each one bear his lot. they were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died: and i have laboured somewhat in my time and not been paid profusely. some good son paint my two hundred pictures—let him try! no doubt, there's something strikes a balance. yes, you loved me quite enough. it seems to-night. this must suffice me here. what would one have? in heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance— four great walls in the new jerusalem, meted on each side by the angel's reed, for leonard, rafael, agnolo and me to cover—the three first without a wife, while i have mine! so—still they overcome because there's still lucrezia,—as i choose.  again the cousin's whistle! go, my love.

 i  androgyne, mon amour, brochette de coeur was plat du jour, (heart lifted on a metal skewer, encore saignante et palpitante) where i dined au solitaire, table intime, one rose vase, lighted dimly, wildly gay, as, punctually, across the bay mist advanced its pompe funèbre, its coolly silvered drift of gray, nightly requiem performed for mourners who have slipped away...  well, that's it, the evening scene, mon amour, androgyne.  noontime youths, thighs and groins tight-jean-displayed, loiter onto union square, junkies flower-scattered there, lost in dream, torso-bare, young as you, old as i, voicing soundlessly a cry, oh, yes, among them revolution bites its tongue beneath its fiery waiting stare, indifferent to siren's wail, ravishment endured in jail. bicentennial salute? youth made flesh of crouching brute.  (dichotomy can i deny of pity in a lustful eye?)  ii  androgyne, mon amour, shadows of you name a price exorbitant for short lease. what would you suggest i do, wryly smile and turn away, fox-teeth gnawing chest-bones through?  even less would that be true than, carnally, i was to you many, many lives ago, requiems of fallen snow.  and, frankly, well, they'd laugh at me, thick of belly, thin of shank, spectacle of long neglect, tragedian of public mirth.  (chekhov's mashas all wore black for a reason i suspect: pertinence? none at all— yet something made me think of that.)  "life!" the gob exclaimed to crane, "oh, life's a geyser!" oui, d'accord— from the rectum of the earth.  bitter, that. never mind. time's only challenger is time.  iii  androgyne, mon amour, cold withdrawal is no cure for addiction grown so deep. now, finally, at cock's crow, released in custody of sleep, dark annealment, time-worn stones far descending, no light there, no sound there, entering depths of thinning breath, farther down more ancient stones, halting not, drawn on until  ever treacherous, ever fair, at a table small and square, not first light but last light shows (meaning of the single rose where i dined au solitaire sous l'ombre d'une jeunesse perdue?)  a ghostly little customs-clerk ("vos documents, mesdames, messieurs?") whose somehow tender mockery contrives to make admittance here at this mineral frontier a definition of the pure...  androgyne, mon amour.  san francisco, 1976

 in that country the animals have the faces of people:  the ceremonial cats possessing the streets  the fox run politely to earth, the huntsmen standing around him, fixed in their tapestry of manners  the bull, embroidered with blood and given an elegant death, trumpets, his name stamped on him, heraldic brand because  (when he rolled on the sand, sword in his heart, the teeth in his blue mouth were human)  he is really a man  even the wolves, holding resonant conversations in their forests thickened with legend.  in this country the animals have the faces of animals.  their eyes flash once in car headlights and are gone.  their deaths are not elegant.  they have the faces of no-one.  
NEW POEM
 this was gruesome—fighting over a ham sandwich with one of the tiny cats of rome, he leaped on my arm and half hung on to the food and half hung on to my shirt and coat. i tore it apart and let him have his portion, i think i lifted him down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat with my own sandwich beside him, maybe i petted his bony head and felt him shiver. i have told this story over and over; some things root in the mind; his boldness, of course, was frightening and unexpected—his stubbornness—though hunger drove him mad. it was the breaking of boundaries, the sudden invasion, but not only that it was the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn't run into an alley or into a cellar, he sat beside me, eating, and i didn't run into a trattoria, say, shaking, with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing; but not only that, i had gone there to eat and wait for someone. i had maybe an hour before she would come and i was full of hope and excitement. i have resisted for years interpreting this, but now i think i was given a clue, or i was giving myself a clue, across the street from the glass sandwich shop. that was my last night with her, the next day i would leave on the train for paris and she would meet her husband. thirty-five years ago i ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were dying together; we never met again although she was pregnant when i left her—i have a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren in norwich, connecticut, or canton, ohio. every five years i think about her again and plan on looking her up. the last time i was sitting in new brunswick, new jersey, and heard that her husband was teaching at princeton, if she was still married, or still alive, and tried calling. i went that far. we lived in florence and rome. we rowed in the bay of naples and floated, naked, on the boards. i started to think of her again today. i still am horrified by the cat's hunger. i still am puzzled by the connection. this is another insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought is fleeting and sweet. i think it's my own dumb boyhood, walking around with slavic cheeks and burning stupid eyes. i think i gave the cat half of my sandwich to buy my life, i think i broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. it was this i bought, the red coleus, the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. happiness. i watched him with pleasure. i bought memory. i could have lost it. how crazy it sounds. his face twisted with cunning. the wind blowing through his hair. his jaw working.  
NEW POEM
 fresh out of the icebox, this brain looks the wrong way from time to time, and misses the cat stepping by, gerry on the screen laboring to tell the nuances his pink matter almost notices, he’s not my brother, not really my close friend, just my necessary neighbor on a bicycle going by like a whistle from the lips of someone i trust. he has a peculiar skeleton arranged his own way in the mind’s pasture. we were as they say “of an age” and so inter- twine somehow, though i wanted to work when he wanted to play. that long nose is in my life and in my writing and so is the okanagan river. i sometimes get to the river when i am at work, the sun on my back not the ink in my pen. there was, when i was last in the okanagan valley, a cat with big paws in the neighborhood, i was told, fires i could see along the hillside, stunning heat from the sky, enough to thaw any brain.  
NEW POEM
 open the window and you want to fly out, though you never actually do—  i think i see you, still there on the ledge, where i've left you.  how pulled-awake and flung can one life be?  again i thought, it will end. again i promised and clung.  i learned there that to cling was in my nature.  i think i see you, though you flash quickly through the shutter.  i think i hear you, though i sleep.  remember this as a bolero, a finite flaring—  both the tulip tree burning in full bloom  and the weeping silver birch.

 the one horse you gave me you took back when she went insane, when she began to chew wood instead of the expensive grain we bought from the feed store, the grain that had the sweet smell of molasses and was good for even us to chew. she turned into an ugly thing with her wild thoughts, and i forgot about the beauty expected of her when her blanket filled out and complemented her chestnut body and the name the nez percé gave her. she rotted and began to stink of promises gone wrong, of gods avenging their defilement. a man who knew what to do with useless horses came and took her away in a wooden trailer she tried to chew, and my tears welled up in huge drops before they splattered on the ground, as i trembled and realized i would have to give up her own ghost for her, ghost which she did not have, ghost which she came here beautifully without.

 bashō, with your grass pillow, what underground sounds come into your dreams? do blue-horned beetles scratch against the starless night sky that lines your head with the starless night skies of their own domed backs? do centipedes trickle through? do worms burrow with their snouts, with their bodies that are entirely snouts? snoozer, i can only ask you this because now you are dead asleep: do i ever appear as a nightcrawler whispering in your ear? are the words, “i love you,” as soft as the cough of a good luck cricket?     each “appleblossom” is a verse translation from the japanese of a short selection from the notebooks of chiri, bashō’s traveling companion during the years between withered chestnuts and travelogue of weatherbeaten bones .

 i shot an arrow into the air, it fell to earth, i knew not where; for, so swiftly it flew, the sight could not follow it in its flight.  i breathed a song into the air, it fell to earth, i knew not where; for who has sight so keen and strong, that it can follow the flight of song?  long, long afterward, in an oak i found the arrow, still unbroke; and the song, from beginning to end, i found again in the heart of a friend.

 as the dead prey upon us, they are the dead in ourselves, awake, my sleeping ones, i cry out to you, disentangle the nets of being!  i pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused. i thought the tires looked as though they only needed air. but suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together  as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered about my mother, some of them taking care to pass beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record playing on the victrola, and all of them desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell  i turned to the young man on my right and asked, “how is it, there?” and he begged me protestingly don’t ask, we are poor poor. and the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard displays, the dead roaming from one to another as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed to mere equipments  my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep when i entered the house as i often found her in a rocker under the lamp, and awaking, as i came up to her, as she ever had  i found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death as other like suited and dressed people did in life  o the dead!  and the indian woman and i enabled the blue deer to walk  and the blue deer talked, in the next room, a negro talk  it was like walking a jackass, and its talk was the pressing gabber of gammers of old women  and we helped walk it around the room because it was seeking socks or shoes for its hooves now that it was acquiring  human possibilities  in the five hindrances men and angels stay caught in the net, in the immense nets which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels and the demons and men go up and down  walk the jackass hear the victrola let the automobile be tucked into a corner of the white fence when it is a white chair. purity  is only an instant of being, the trammels  recur  in the five hindrances, perfection is hidden i shall get to the place 10 minutes late.  it will be 20 minutes of 9. and i don’t know,  without the car,  how i shall get there  o peace, my mother, i do not know how differently i could have done what i did or did not do.  that you are back each week that you fall asleep with your face to the right  that you are present there when i come in as you were when you were alive  that you are as solid, and your flesh is as i knew it, that you have the company i am used to your having  but o, that you all find it such a cheapness!  o peace, mother, for the mammothness of the comings and goings of the ladders of life  the nets we are entangled in. awake, my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle of  being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires be left upon the earth. let even your mother go. let there be only paradise  the desperateness is, that the instant which is also paradise (paradise is happiness) dissolves into the next instant, and power flows to meet the next occurrence  is it any wonder my mother comes back? do not that throng rightly seek the room where they might expect happiness? they did not complain of life, they obviously wanted the movie, each other, merely to pass among each other there, where the real is, even to the display cards, to be out of hell  the poverty of hell  o souls, in life and in death, make, even as you sleep, even in sleep know what wind even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods, equipment, entertainment, the foods the indian woman, the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot ‘viewbook,’ the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room lifts the sodden nets  and they disappear as ghosts do, as spider webs, nothing before the hand of man  the vent! you must have the vent, or you shall die. which means never to die, the ghastliness  of going, and forever coming back, returning to the instants which were not lived  o mother, this i could not have done, i could not have lived what you didn’t, i am myself netted in my own being  i want to die. i want to make that instant, too, perfect  o my soul, slip the cog   ii  the death in life (death itself) is endless, eternity is the false cause  the knot is other wise, each topological corner presents itself, and no sword cuts it, each knot is itself its fire  each knot of which the net is made is for the hands to untake the knot’s making. and touch alone can turn the knot into its own flame  (o mother, if you had once touched me  o mother, if i had once touched you)  the car did not burn. its underside was not presented to me a grotesque corpse. the old man  merely removed it as i looked up at it, and put it in a corner of the picket fence like was it my mother’s white dog?  or a child’s chair  the woman, playing on the grass, with her son (the woman next door)  was angry with me whatever it was slipped across the playpen or whatever she had out there on the grass  and i was quite flip in reply that anyone who used plastic had to expect things to skid  and break, that i couldn’t worry that her son might have been hurt by whatever it was i sent skidding  down on them.  it was just then i went into my house and to my utter astonishment found my mother sitting there  as she always had sat, as must she always forever sit there her head lolling into sleep? awake, awake my mother  what wind will lift you too forever from the tawdriness, make you rich as all those souls  crave crave crave  to be rich?  they are right. we must have what we want. we cannot afford not to. we have only one course:  the nets which entangle us are flames  o souls, burn alive, burn now  that you may forever have peace, have  what you crave  o souls, go into everything, let not one knot pass through your fingers  let not any they tell you you must sleep as the net comes through your authentic hands  what passes is what is, what shall be, what has been, what hell and heaven is is earth to be rent, to shoot you through the screen of flame which each knot hides as all knots are a wall ready to be shot open by you  the nets of being are only eternal if you sleep as your hands ought to be busy. method, method  i too call on you to come to the aid of all men, to women most who know most, to woman to tell men to awake. awake, men, awake  i ask my mother to sleep. i ask her to stay in the chair. my chair is in the corner of the fence. she sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. the blue deer need not trouble either of us.  and if she sits in happiness the souls who trouble her and me will also rest. the automobile  has been hauled away.

 when the puppy snarfles for breakfast i wake to the radiator gurgling then feet crunching the reticent snow. before i was born, mother sewed her own suits. what do her ashes know?  •  father shoved snow off the supine roof. mother crafted christmas ornaments: glue and glitter and red balls. no tinsel, no angels. her death started in the living room.  •  for bonsai, pliers the size of a nail clipper, spools of wire and a fist-sized rock. one bore a petite pomegranate, never to eat, not to touch. her death began with a baseball bat.  •  in the vineyard, he secured the strongest cane from training stake to fruiting wire. pruning with handsaw and lopper. he’d leave a spur for the next season. he shoved her away with direct objects.  •  in a cold snap if one pipe freezes, the rest may freeze as well. even before the puppy snarfles. even before a baby brother arrived in the misleading car in mother’s arms.  •  after the war, after she met father, she smoked cigarettes but didn’t cha-cha anymore. she’d light up and blow smoke out the apoplectic window. he found the ashes on the sill.  •  fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside the savvy window of my own first home. on the stereo, a bluesman cried, i need my ashes hauled! the dress was too smart to wear.  •  i tucked away our baby’s pink layette in circumspect mothballs for a christening that never took place. as well, a doll that auntie crocheted. more than anything, i love tidal pools.  •  i know her ashes are at father’s, lost in his charnel of junk mail. he claims that thieves have stolen that box, his knob cutter and root hook. he says, remains aren’t ashes anyways.  •  winter stripped everything to the limb and dejected nest. no angels, no crèche. i don’t know whose recollections are suspect: after leaving maui, mother learned to swim. she loved tidal pools more than anything.  •  in my kitchen, the logs blink in the fire — through blinds, the wind blusters and the browbeaten trees creak in the orchard. the rain pours then stops for sun. if he lost mother’s ashes what more could i stand?  •  omusubi tastes best on black beaches. since mother never learned to swim, did she watch her five brothers from a blanket? on the intransigent subway, i don’t know if i’ve passed my station. (his mother said yes—) iron: i bit my lip again.  •  mother showed our baby how to sift flour and how to crank an eggbeater. after father lost her, he barred everyone from the rooms and the yard where at night long red worms slither up from the ground.  •  her ashes know: before the puppy snarfles, father shoves snow off the supine roof; for bonsai, use pliers the size of a nail clipper; in the vineyard, the strongest canes; in a cold snap, a hair dryer on frozen pipes; fireflies blinked for mates or prey outside while i tucked away my baby’s pink layette. her ashes know their box is in the living room where she didn’t cha-cha anymore. where has winter stripped everything to the nest? in my kitchen, the logs blink in the fire and i know omusubi tastes best on black beaches. she knew to show her granddaughter how to sift flour.

 alas, have i not pain enough, my friend, upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire than did on him who first stale down the fire, while love on me doth all his quiver spend, but with your rhubarb words you must contend to grieve me worse, in saying that desire doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire of sinful thoughts, which do in ruin end? if that be sin which doth the manners frame, well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed, ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame; if that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed a loathing of all loose unchastity, then love is sin, and let me sinful be.

 no more, my dear, no more these counsels try; oh, give my passions leave to run their race; let fortune lay on me her worst disgrace; let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry; let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye; let me no steps but of lost labour trace; let all the earth with scorn recount my case, but do not will me from my love to fly. i do not envy aristotle's wit, nor do aspire to caesar's bleeding fame; nor aught do care though some above me sit; nor hope nor wish another course to frame, but that which once may win thy cruel heart: thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.

 for marina  you say the old masters never got it wrong, but when goya painted the death of the imagination it was a lost dog against a usurious yellow sky and the dog, a hapless creature who had drawn itself ten miles on two legs, stared in amazement to see the man who once fed him from his plate reduced to this.  so i felt this week, the vile soil and everything upon it— the beggar guest kicked from the table before his own dog, and even the honest unpicking of art performed nightly and in seclusion. like any penelope my armor is resignation although i thought i would lift the bow myself and draw.  by the morning he is gone and what to make of this? the prostitutes hang from a beam like mice the suitors are piled unburied in the yard. and some say that it is now much better and others, that it is worse. so order was restored i stared in amazement  •  perhaps akhmatova was right when she wrote who knows what shit what tip, what pile of waste brings forth the tender verse like hogweed, like the fat hen under the fence like the unbearable present tense who knows what ill, what strife what crude shack of a life and how it twists sweetly about the broken sill: pressingness, another word for honeysuckle but housewives? has poetry ever deepened in the pail was it ever found in the sink, under the table did it rise in the oven, quietly able to outhowl the hoover? does it press more than the children’s supper the sudden sleepless wail? did it ever? it lives. it takes seed like the most unforgiving weed grows wilder as the child grows older and spits on dreams, did i say how it thrives in the ashen family nest or how iambs are measured best where it hurts: with the heel of an iron on the reluctant breast of a shirt?  •  michael blann   there was a hush, then michael blann stepped out onto the stage. michael blann, with his pipe and his jukebox head oh, he’s your man.  he has a song for all weathers, a pipe and a voice, and he sings and he roams he sings to the wind and a dog of how the trees are all bare and jack’s come home.  he’s a thin voice, like a spider thread on days when the sun is late and fine live and let live, sings michael blann the wind yields not, but the hills is mine.  he’s no call for fate passing over his sheep are all angels, the stars are his lords he’ll play any part the clouds should fancy to humble tunes and hand-me-down words  the acts are written in briar strands and the pharisees are leaves in the air i likes a drop pipes michael blann sing follow hark forward the innocent hare.  he wore to his end a clutch of sheep’s wool to show the gods that michael blann went alone, alone for most of his years but crossed the hills a singing man.

 someone is looking for us. i sensed it earlier at the creek while floating on my back, and again on route 8 near brookline. so we’ve detoured to this hillside eroding and crazy with markers. we’re looking for row mm or nn or something like that. i lug the baby; my wife runs ahead. this neighborhood knows her– she passes so easily between stones. she finds the grave, her father dead ten years now. in the time it takes to say kaddish the sun’s dropped. i set down my son and he crawls in the dimness, pulling himself up on the headstone. how delicately he fingers the marble. quickly he rounds its corner. vanishes. i’m thinking:grass, stone, quiet– then babbling from another world.

 alexandria, 1954 when my grandfather came back from his swim, battered this time by the treacherous currents, the rocks jutting out of the water like knives,  my sister and i sidled into his room thinking the house too quiet and saw him like a hurt beast standing by his bed, naked, wet.  my grandmother was kneeling, toweling his calves, my mother was mixing a poultice. “look at his bruises,” my sister was whispering, “and the veins like swollen rivers.”  we kept inching toward him while my grandmother daubed him with cream and wound him in a bedsheet and made him odder than any dream of him. “children,” she said turning toward us, “let him sleep, this is your grandfather.”  we hurried away, having said not a word to him, nor he to us, though our eyes had never left his body and we ached to touch him, brush our fingertips along the webs of cuts and discolorations in his pale skin.  all day we wished he would somehow rise like a true ghost, the sheet ruffling in the drafts; “grandfather,” we whispered at his closed door, “come to us, bring us your stories,”  but when the last lights were put out that night and the dark spread about us like a purple bruise we wished we had never wished what we had, every waft of wind had a rustle to it and the sound of water was deep in our ears  and by morning, he had become for us in his shut room the ghostliest of imaginings, and keeping our distance, we waited only for his door to suddenly swing forth and reveal him standing either healed and smiling and unstrange, or what seemed likelier to us now, about to change our lives.  
NEW POEM
 although it is a cold evening, down by one of the fishhouses an old man sits netting, his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, a dark purple-brown, and his shuttle worn and polished. the air smells so strong of codfish it makes one’s nose run and one’s eyes water. the five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up to storerooms in the gables for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. all is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, is opaque, but the silver of the benches, the lobster pots, and masts, scattered among the wild jagged rocks, is of an apparent translucence like the small old buildings with an emerald moss growing on their shoreward walls. the big fish tubs are completely lined with layers of beautiful herring scales and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered with creamy iridescent coats of mail, with small iridescent flies crawling on them. up on the little slope behind the houses, set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, is an ancient wooden capstan, cracked, with two long bleached handles and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, where the ironwork has rusted. the old man accepts a lucky strike. he was a friend of my grandfather. we talk of the decline in the population and of codfish and herring while he waits for a herring boat to come in. there are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. he has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, the blade of which is almost worn away.  down at the water’s edge, at the place where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp descending into the water, thin silver tree trunks are laid horizontally across the gray stones, down and down at intervals of four or five feet.  cold dark deep and absolutely clear, element bearable to no mortal, to fish and to seals . . . one seal particularly i have seen here evening after evening. he was curious about me. he was interested in music; like me a believer in total immersion, so i used to sing him baptist hymns. i also sang “a mighty fortress is our god.” he stood up in the water and regarded me steadily, moving his head a little. then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug as if it were against his better judgment. cold dark deep and absolutely clear, the clear gray icy water . . . back, behind us, the dignified tall firs begin. bluish, associating with their shadows, a million christmas trees stand waiting for christmas. the water seems suspended above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. i have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, icily free above the stones, above the stones and then the world. if you should dip your hand in, your wrist would ache immediately, your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn as if the water were a transmutation of fire that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. if you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, then briny, then surely burn your tongue. it is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.

"when making an axe handle the pattern is not far off." and i say this to kai "look: we'll shape the handle by checking the handle of the axe we cut with—" and he sees. and i hear it again: it's in lu ji's wên fu, fourth century a.d. "essay on literature"-—in the preface: "in making the handle of an axe by cutting wood with an axe the model is indeed near at hand." my teacher shih-hsiang chen translated that and taught it years ago and i see: pound was an axe, chen was an axe, i am an axe and my son a handle, soon to be shaping again, model and tool, craft of culture, how we go on.

 for john limon the game of baseball is not a metaphor and i know it’s not really life. the chalky green diamond, the lovely dusty brown lanes i see from airplanes multiplying around the cities are only neat playing fields. their structure is not the frame of history carved out of forest, that is not what i see on my ascent.  and down in the stadium, the veteran catcher guiding the young pitcher through the innings, the line of concentration between them, that delicate filament is not like the way you are helping me, only it reminds me when i strain for analogies, the way a rookie strains for perfection, and the veteran, in his wisdom, seems to promise it, it glows from his upheld glove,  and the man in front of me in the grandstand, drinking banana daiquiris from a thermos, continuing through a whole dinner to the aromatic cigar even as our team is shut out, nearly hitless, he is not like the farmer that auden speaks of in breughel’s icarus, or the four inevitable woman-hating drunkards, yelling, hugging each other and moving up and down continuously for more beer  and the young wife trying to understand what a full count could be to please her husband happy in his old dreams, or the little boy in the yankees cap already nodding off to sleep against his father, program and popcorn memories sliding into the future, and the old woman from lincoln, maine, screaming at the yankee slugger with wounded knees to break his leg  this is not a microcosm, not even a slice of life  and the terrible slumps, when the greatest hitter mysteriously goes hitless for weeks, or the pitcher’s stuff is all junk who threw like a magician all last month, or the days when our guys look like sennett cops, slipping, bumping each other, then suddenly, the play that wasn’t humanly possible, the kid we know isn’t ready for the big leagues, leaps into the air to catch a ball that should have gone downtown, and coming off the field is hugged and bottom-slapped by the sudden sorcerers, the winning team  the question of what makes a man slump when his form, his eye, his power aren’t to blame, this isn’t like the bad luck that hounds us, and his frustration in the games not like our deep rage for disappointing ourselves  the ball park is an artifact, manicured, safe, “scene in an easter egg”, and the order of the ball game, the firm structure with the mystery of accidents always contained, not the wild field we wander in, where i’m trying to recite the rules, to repeat the statistics of the game, and the wind keeps carrying my words away

NEW POEM
 beautiful dreamer, wake unto me, starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee; sounds of the rude world heard in the day, lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd a way!  beautiful dreamer, queen of my song, list while i woo thee with soft melody; gone are the cares of life's busy throng,— beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! beautiful dreamer awake unto me!  beautiful dreamer, out on the sea mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie; over the streamlet vapors are borne, waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.  beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart, e'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea; then will all clouds of sorrow depart,— beautiful dreamer, awake unto me! beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!  
NEW POEM
 all dreams of the soul end in a beautiful man’s or woman’s body.  —yeats, “the phases of the moon”  whenever we wake, still joined, enraptured— at the window, each clear night’s finish the black pulse of dominoes dropping to land;  whenever we embrace, haunted, upwelling, i know a reunion is taking place—  hear me when i say our love’s not meant to be an opiate; helpmate, you are the reachable mirror that dares me to risk the caravan back to the apogee, the longed-for arms of the beloved—   dusks of paperwhites, dusks of jasmine, intimate beyond belief  beautiful signor  no dread of nakedness  beautiful signor  my long ship, my opulence, my garland  beautiful signor  extinguishing the beggar’s tin, the wind of longing  beautiful signor  laving the ruined country, the heart wedded to war  beautiful signor  the kiln-blaze in my body, the turning heaven  beautiful signor  you cover me with pollen  beautiful signor  into your sweet mouth—  
NEW POEM
 into perplexity: as an itch chased round an oxter or early man in the cave mouth watching rain-drifts pour from beyond  his understanding. whether to admire the mere sensation, enough, or hold out for sweeter ornament, vessels of wonder  born with that ur-charm of symmetry; lovely ones we ache to prize and praise, climb into and become because they try  our day-by-day significance: some of us ugly and most of us plain, walked past in the drowned streets: pearls of paste,  salted butter, secondary colors. they drift unapproached, gazed never-selves, blunt paragons of genetic industry. we  desire them but cannot want such order. we stand, mouths open, and cannot help stammering our secrets, nailed to water.  
NEW POEM
 i stood in a longhouse with a woman who may or may not be mohawk. some shift their opinions about her like meteorologists, as if her blood were a storm system tracked in its comings and goings. but the father of her two sons was, without question, seneca. we knew that, in haudenosaunee country, a father is to some degree irrelevant, that her own shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing certain, terminal conditions. she waited on an elder she called steam (warning i was not to call the elder woman by that name). steam (not steam) would observe the boys, understand their natures, give them their creator names defining their lives during the next ceremony. i confessed my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency- deficient community, and confessed that my clan mother, three hours away, did not know me well enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed a more casual ceremony. you find your name after a social misstep, a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. names offer the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder than theirs, no matter the truth.  our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. my name is not like steam (no one is forbidden to use it). no one calls me batman because of my status, my utility belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles, my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because i wore the cape to an older age than i should have, and could continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away any time soon. even kids who only know christian bale or michael keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood, still think batman is my name.  and this is why i have no memory for when or how you became the bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal. you soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth, and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings, black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.  what metaphor suits the night i left on the amtrak for chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood on the platform, watching those cars pull out, the night i wanted to leap from the train, stay?  i cannot invent new names for the ways we slow, struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures without measure, defy actuary numbers and because i have gone closer to the light than you have, the story is easier to craft and finesse than it should be.  pollination trails are smaller than those i’m forced to fly in, and lying in little rock, santa fe, manhattan, minneapolis, seattle, hotel rooms, the ellipse of your name trail winds me home, waiting, dusted in pollen and history.  
NEW POEM
 after twenty years of marriage, we walked out of the bush and on to a rough dirt road we followed till we saw a pond we might be able to get to. the ground was boggy and buzzing. the pond was thick with weed and slime. it was not the sort of pond anyone would swim in, but we did — picking and sliding into the water over the bog and bees, bees we suddenly noticed were everywhere, were settling on our hair as we swam, ducks turning surprised eyes our way. after twenty years of marriage what is surprising isn’t really so much the person you are with but to find yourselves so out of place in this scene, cold but not able to get out without stepping over bees, so many bees.  
NEW POEM
 the termites had deboned the thing it was clean there was no saving it  in one bedroom a dresser with blue drawers its peg-legs rested on pure membrane  a girl just stood in her underwear ran the tips of her fingers over her ribs  thought greyhound no one knew no explaining why she didn’t fall through the floor  the kids were drinking beer in the yard the tetherball rope caught one girl’s throat  her mother’s face obscured behind the porch screen the mesquite shadow  no one could make her out her feet rested on hot sashes of dust  the sounds on the television were far away as that big caliche mound looked lake a waving man  the president got shot the boards stayed together for another three days  it was a matter of apathy or swelling or everyone was too hot to move  
NEW POEM
 mother said to call her if the h-bomb exploded and i said i would, and it about did when louis my brother robbed a service station and lay cursing on the oily cement in handcuffs.  but by that time it was too late to tell mother, she was too sick to worry the life out of her over why why . causation is sequence and everything is one thing after another.  besides, my other brother, eddie, had got to be president, and you can't ask too much of one family. the chances were as good for a good future as bad for a bad one.  therefore it was surprising that, as we kept the newspapers from mother, she died feeling responsible for a disaster unverified, murmuring, in her sleep as it seemed, the ancient slogan noblesse oblige.  
NEW POEM
 can these movements which move themselves be the substance of my attraction? where does this thin green silk come from that covers my body? surely any woman wearing such fabrics would move her body just to feel them touching every part of her.  yet most of the women frown, or look away, or laugh stiffly. they are afraid of these materials and these movements in some way. the psychologists would say they are afraid of themselves, somehow. perhaps awakening too much desire— that their men could never satisfy? so they keep themselves laced and buttoned and made up in hopes that the framework will keep them stiff enough not to feel the whole register. in hopes that they will not have to experience that unquenchable desire for rhythm and contact.  if a snake glided across this floor most of them would faint or shrink away. yet that movement could be their own. that smooth movement frightens them— awakening ancestors and relatives to the tips of the arms and toes.  so my bare feet and my thin green silks my bells and finger cymbals offend them—frighten their old-young bodies. while the men simper and leer— glad for the vicarious experience and exercise. they do not realize how i scorn them; or how i dance for their frightened, unawakened, sweet women.  
NEW POEM
 they decide finally not to speak of it, the one blemish in their otherwise blameless marriage. it happened  as these things do, before the permanence was set, before the children grew complicated, before the quench  of loving one another became all each of them wanted from this life. years later the bite  of not knowing (and not wanting to know) still pierces the doer as much as the one to whom it was done:  the threadbare lying, the insufferable longing, the inimitable lack of touching, the undoing undone.  
NEW POEM
 ruminant pillows! gregarious soft boulders!  if one of you found a gap in a stone wall, the rest of you—rams, ewes, bucks, wethers, lambs; mothers and daughters, old grandfather-father, cousins and aunts, small bleating sons— followed onward, stupid as sheep, wherever your leader’s sheep-brain wandered to.  my grandfather spent all day searching the valley and edges of ragged mountain, calling “ke-day!” as if he brought you salt, “ke-day! ke-day!”  *         *         *  when the shirt wore out, and darns in the woolen shirt needed darning, a woman in a white collar cut the shirt into strips and braided it, as she braided her hair every morning.  in a hundred years the knees of her great-granddaughter crawled on a rug made from the wool of sheep whose bones were mud, like the bones of the woman, who stares from an oval in the parlor.  *         *         *  i forked the brambly hay down to you in nineteen-fifty. i delved my hands deep in the winter grass of your hair.  when the shearer cut to your nakedness in april and you dropped black eyes in shame, hiding in barnyard corners, unable to hide, i brought grain to raise your spirits, and ten thousand years wound us through pasture and hayfield together, threads of us woven together, three hundred generations from africa’s hills to new hampshire’s.  *         *         *  you were not shrewd like the pig. you were not strong like the horse. you were not brave like the rooster.  yet none of the others looked like a lump of granite that grew hair, and none of the others carried white fleece as soft as dandelion seed around a black face, and none of them sang such a flat and sociable song.  *         *         *   now the black-faced sheep have wandered and will not return, even if i should search the valleys and call “ke-day,” as if i brought them salt. now the railroad draws a line of rust through the valley. birch, pine, and maple lean from cellarholes and cover the dead pastures of ragged mountain except where machines make snow and cables pull money up hill, to slide back down.  *         *         *  at south danbury church twelve of us sit— cousins and aunts, sons— where the great-grandfathers of the forty-acre farms filled every pew. i look out the window at summer places, at boston lawyers’ houses with swimming pools cunningly added to cowsheds, and we read an old poem aloud, about israel’s sheep, old lumps of wool, and we read  that the rich farmer, though he names his farm for himself, takes nothing into his grave; that even if people praise us, because we are successful, we will go under the ground to meet our ancestors collected there in the darkness; that we are all of us sheep, and death is our shepherd, and we die as the animals die.  
NEW POEM
 1 white lather on black soap— maria’s gift. it reminds me of when a woman died and they handed me her ring.  then they left to divide the roots for her. daylight went down there shining. by accident, cleaning the hearth of a house to leave it for good, i learned how to see a star come out: work my hand into the ashes.  2 “you’ve thrown a chestnut hull into the fireplace again,” said colette’s mother, “my clean ashes!” naughty colette had soiled the washing ashes of applewood, poplar, and elm. stretched over the big cauldron in the washhouse, hemp cloth held the ashes the washwoman poured a jug of boiling water on. they smelled almost sweet as the lye filtered into the mass of linen. the air darkened with blue clouds. in the smoking lava layer of ashes, a few cinders of chestnut hulls, the tannin’s yellow stain.  3 look for something you’ve been every day of your life. you said it was “lonely.” i’m certain it is also “clean.” my body’s big years diminish soap. my grandmother, whose diamond it was, had a stone in her tub. i rubbed it on my feet as later i walked, building little hoofs, all summer shoeless on creek gravel.  that black bar of stone in the widow’s clean house, that volcanic pumice skips over most hard places but softens at least one.  4 once there was a downpour of rain they took as a judgment. it confused her billowing, steaming skirts. another time—those times were hard— the executioner let go the twisted hemp from her neck sooner than he should because the flames reached his hands. nor would i, if i’d had to live then, put my hands into the fire those three hours it took to reduce her. but after, i’d scrub all over with the ashes of the still warm black heart of the witch.

NEW POEM
 for philip hobsbaum late august, given heavy rain and sun for a full week, the blackberries would ripen. at first, just one, a glossy purple clot among others, red, green, hard as a knot. you ate that first one and its flesh was sweet like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for picking. then red ones inked up and that hunger sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills we trekked and picked until the cans were full, until the tinkling bottom had been covered with green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned like a plate of eyes. our hands were peppered with thorn pricks, our palms sticky as bluebeard's.  we hoarded the fresh berries in the byre. but when the bath was filled we found a fur, a rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache. the juice was stinking too. once off the bush the fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour. i always felt like crying. it wasn't fair that all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot. each year i hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.  
NEW POEM
 as through marble or the lining of certain fish split open and scooped clean, this is the blue vein that rides, where the flesh is even whiter than the rest of her, the splayed thighs mother forgets, busy struggling for command over bones: her own, those of the chaise longue, all equally uncooperative, and there’s the wind, too. this is her hair, gone from white to blue in the air.  this is the black, shot with blue, of my dark daddy’s knuckles, that do not change, ever. which is to say they are no more pale in anger than at rest, or when, as i imagine them now, they follow the same two fingers he has always used to make the rim of every empty blue glass in the house sing. always, the same blue-to-black sorrow no black surface can entirely hide.  under the night, somewhere between the white that is nothing so much as blue, and the black that is, finally; nothing, i am the man neither of you remembers. shielding, in the half-dark, the blue eyes i sometimes forget i don’t have. pulling my own stoop- shouldered kind of blues across paper. apparently misinformed about the rumored stuff of dreams: everywhere i inquired, i was told look for blue.  
NEW POEM
 like primitives we buried the cat with his bowl. bare-handed we scraped sand and gravel back into the hole. it fell with a hiss and thud on his side, on his long red fur, the white feathers that grew between his toes, and his long, not to say aquiline, nose. we stood and brushed each other off. there are sorrows much keener than these. silent the rest of the day, we worked, ate, stared, and slept. it stormed all night; now it clears, and a robin burbles from a dripping bush like the neighbor who means well but always says the wrong thing.

NEW POEM
 [for alix walcott] i   between the vision of the tourist board and the true paradise lies the desert where isaiah’s elations force a rose from the sand. the thirty-third canto  cores the dawn clouds with concentric radiance, the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the bounty, bois-pain, tree of bread, slave food, the bliss of john clare,  torn, wandering tom, stoat-stroker in his county of reeds and stalk-crickets, fiddling the dank air, lacing his boots with vines, steering glazed beetles  with the tenderest prods, knight of the cockchafer, wrapped in the mists of shires, their snail-horned steeples palms opening to the cupped pool—but his soul safer  than ours, though iron streams fetter his ankles. frost whitening his stubble, he stands in the ford of a brook like the baptist lifting his branches to bless  cathedrals and snails, the breaking of this new day, and the shadows of the beach road near which my mother lies, with the traffic of insects going to work anyway.  the lizard on the white wall fixed on the hieroglyph of its stone shadow, the palms’ rustling archery, the souls and sails of circling gulls rhyme with:  “in la sua volont    è nostra pace,” in his will is our peace. peace in white harbours, in marinas whose masts agree, in crescent melons  left all night in the fridge, in the egyptian labours of ants moving boulders of sugar, words in this sentence, shadow and light, who live next door like neighbours,  and in sardines with pepper sauce. my mother lies near the white beach stones, john clare near the sea-almonds, yet the bounty returns each daybreak, to my surprise,  to my surprise and betrayal, yes, both at once. i am moved like you, mad tom, by a line of ants; i behold their industry and they are giants.   ii   there on the beach, in the desert, lies the dark well where the rose of my life was lowered, near the shaken plants, near a pool of fresh tears, tolled by the golden bell  of allamanda, thorns of the bougainvillea, and that is their bounty! they shine with defiance from weed and flower, even those that flourish elsewhere, vetch, ivy, clematis,  on whom the sun now rises with all its power, not for the tourist board or for dante alighieri, but because there is no other path for its wheel to take  except to make the ruts of the beach road an allegory of this poem’s career, of yours, that she died for the sake of a crowning wreath of false laurel; so, john clare, forgive me,  for this morning’s sake, forgive me, coffee, and pardon me, milk with two packets of artificial sugar, as i watch these lines grow and the art of poetry harden me  into sorrow as measured as this, to draw the veiled figure of mamma entering the standard elegiac. no, there is grief, there will always be, but it must not madden,  like clare, who wept for a beetle’s loss, for the weight of the world in a bead of dew on clematis or vetch, and the fire in these tinder-dry lines of this poem i hate  as much as i love her, poor rain-beaten wretch, redeemer of mice, earl of the doomed protectorate of cavalry under your cloak; come on now, enough!   iii   bounty! in the bells of tree-frogs with their steady clamour in the indigo dark before dawn, the fading morse of fireflies and crickets, then light on the beetle’s armour,  and the toad’s too-late presages, nettles of remorse that shall spring from her grave from the spade’s heartbreak. and yet not to have loved her enough is to love more,  if i confess it, and i confess it. the trickle of underground springs, the babble of swollen gulches under drenched ferns, loosening the grip of their roots, till their hairy clods  like unclenching fists swirl wherever the gulch turns them, and the shuddering aftermath bends the rods of wild cane. bounty in the ant’s waking fury,  in the snail’s chapel stirring under wild yams, praise in decay and process, awe in the ordinary in wind that reads the lines of the breadfruit’s palms  in the sun contained in a globe of the crystal dew, bounty in the ants’ continuing a line of raw flour, mercy on the mongoose scuttling past my door,  in the light’s parallelogram laid on the kitchen floor, for thine is the kingdom, the glory, and the power, the bells of saint clement’s in the marigolds on the altar,  in the bougainvillea’s thorns, in the imperial lilac and the feathery palms that nodded at the entry into jerusalem, the weight of the world on the back  of an ass; dismounting, he left his cross there for sentry and sneering centurion; then i believed in his word, in a widow’s immaculate husband, in pews of brown wood,  when the cattle-bell of the chapel summoned our herd into the varnished stalls, in whose rustling hymnals i heard the fresh jacobean springs, the murmur clare heard  of bounty abiding, the clear language she taught us, “as the hart panteth,” at this, her keen ears pronged while her three fawns nibbled the soul-freshening waters,  “as the hart panteth for the water-brooks” that belonged to the language in which i mourn her now, or when i showed her my first elegy, her husband’s, and then her own.   iv   but can she or can she not read this? can you read this, mamma, or hear it? if i took the pulpit, lay-preacher like tender clare, like poor tom, so that look, miss!  the ants come to you like children, their beloved teacher alix, but unlike the silent recitation of the infants, the choir that clare and tom heard in their rainy county,  we have no solace but utterance, hence this wild cry. snails move into harbour, the breadfruit plants on the bounty will be heaved aboard, and the white god is captain bligh.  across white feathery grave-grass the shadow of the soul passes, the canvas cracks open on the cross-trees of the bounty, and the trades lift the shrouds of the resurrected sail.  all move in their passage to the same mother-country, the dirt-clawing weasel, the blank owl or sunning seal. faith grows mutinous. the ribbed body with its cargo  stalls in its doldrums, the god-captain is cast adrift by a mutinous christian, in the wake of the turning argo plants bob in the ocean’s furrows, their shoots dip and lift,  and the soul’s australia is like the new testament after the old world, the code of an eye for an eye; the horizon spins slowly and authority’s argument  diminishes in power, in the longboat with captain bligh. this was one of your earliest lessons, how the christ-son questions the father, to settle on another island, haunted by him,  by the speck of a raging deity on the ruled horizon, diminishing in meaning and distance, growing more dim: all these predictable passages that we first disobey  before we become what we challenged; but you never altered your voice, either sighing or sewing, you would pray to your husband aloud, pedalling the hymns we all heard  in the varnished pew: “there is a green hill far away,” “jerusalem the golden.” your melody faltered but never your faith in the bounty which is his word.   v   all of these waves crepitate from the culture of ovid, its sibilants and consonants; a universal metre piles up these signatures like inscriptions of seaweed  that dry in the pungent sun, lines ruled by mitre and laurel, or spray swiftly garlanding the forehead of an outcrop (and i hope this settles the matter  of presences). no soul was ever invented, yet every presence is transparent; if i met her (in her nightdress ankling barefoot, crooning to the shallows),  should i call her shadow that of a pattern invented by graeco-roman design, columns of shadows cast by the forum, augustan perspectives—  poplars, casuarina-colonnades, the in-and-out light of almonds made from original latin, no leaf but the olive’s? questions of pitch. faced with seraphic radiance  (don’t interrupt!), mortals rub their skeptical eyes that hell is a beach-fire at night where embers dance, with temporal fireflies like thoughts of paradise;  but there are inexplicable instincts that keep recurring not from hope or fear only, that are real as stones, the faces of the dead we wait for as ants are transferring  their cities, though we no longer believe in the shining ones. i half-expect to see you no longer, then more than half, almost never, or never then—there i have said it—  but felt something less than final at the edge of your grave, some other something somewhere, equally dreaded, since the fear of the infinite is the same as death,  unendurable brightness, the substantial dreading its own substance, dissolving to gases and vapours, like our dread of distance; we need a horizon,  a dividing line that turns the stars into neighbours though infinity separates them, we can think of only one sun: all i am saying is that the dread of death is in the faces  we love, the dread of our dying, or theirs; therefore we see in the glint of immeasurable spaces not stars or falling embers, not meteors, but tears.   vi   the mango trees serenely rust when they are in flower, nobody knows the name for that voluble cedar whose bell-flowers fall, the pomme-arac purples its floor.  the blue hills in late afternoon always look sadder. the country night waiting to come in outside the door; the firefly keeps striking matches, and the hillside fumes  with a bluish signal of charcoal, then the smoke burns into a larger question, one that forms and unforms, then loses itself in a cloud, till the question returns.  buckets clatter under pipes, villages begin at corners. a man and his trotting dog come back from their garden. the sea blazes beyond the rust roofs, dark is on us  before we know it. the earth smells of what’s done, small yards brighten, day dies and its mourners begin, the first wreath of gnats; this was when we sat down  on bright verandahs watching the hills die. nothing is trite once the beloved have vanished; empty clothes in a row, but perhaps our sadness tires them who cherished delight;  not only are they relieved of our customary sorrow, they are without hunger, without any appetite, but are part of earth’s vegetal fury; their veins grow  with the wild mammy-apple, the open-handed breadfruit, their heart in the open pomegranate, in the sliced avocado; ground-doves pick from their palms; ants carry the freight  of their sweetness, their absence in all that we eat, their savour that sweetens all of our multiple juices, their faith that we break and chew in a wedge of cassava,  and here at first is the astonishment: that earth rejoices in the middle of our agony, earth that will have her for good: wind shines white stones and the shallows’ voices.   vii   in spring, after the bear’s self-burial, the stuttering crocuses open and choir, glaciers shelve and thaw, frozen ponds crack into maps, green lances spring  from the melting fields, flags of rooks rise and tatter the pierced light, the crumbling quiet avalanches of an unsteady sky; the vole uncoils and the otter  worries his sleek head through the verge’s branches; crannies, culverts, and creeks roar with wrist-numbing water. deer vault invisible hurdles and sniff the sharp air,  squirrels spring up like questions, berries easily redden, edges delight in their own shapes (whoever their shaper). but here there is one season, our viridian eden  is that of the primal garden that engendered decay, from the seed of a beetle’s shard or a dead hare white and forgotten as winter with spring on its way.  there is no change now, no cycles of spring, autumn, winter, nor an island’s perpetual summer; she took time with her; no climate, no calendar except for this bountiful day.  as poor tom fed his last crust to trembling birds, as by reeds and cold pools john clare blest these thin musicians, let the ants teach me again with the long lines of words,  my business and duty, the lesson you taught your sons, to write of the light’s bounty on familiar things that stand on the verge of translating themselves into news:  the crab, the frigate that floats on cruciform wings, and that nailed and thorn riddled tree that opens its pews to the blackbird that hasn’t forgotten her because it sings.

 when i think of that room i see the de kooning at the end of the hall  sometimes rain on the long windows or the tinkering of drops on the skylight  but not yvon splashing scotch into a cocktail glass  otherwise fastidious—  in retrospect i should have asked her more  about the famous jazz guitarist she had been engaged to  but that much was true—  even after she bought me a pocket knife sheathed in velvet  every young man needs a knife she informed her group  but in the restaurant her friends eyed me like a turnip. one that talked—  while she was away at her office, i tried to read  her unfinished essay on the vagaries of diplomacy  reclining on a rug of embroidered storks  the two small rodins seemed misplaced  a grand piano she didn’t play  (though i did, affecting a controlled passion  while gazing over rooftops at carefully maintained gardens)—  i don’t remember her smell  i don’t recall her fingers  the last i heard she was living in barcelona  she never did learn to cook  now her letters are worth money

 this must happen just after i die: at sunrise i bend over my grandparents' empty house in hazelwood and pull it out of the soft cindered earth by the mon river. copper tubing and electric lines hang down like hairs. the house is the size of a matchbox. i sprinkle bits of broken pallets, seeded grass, fingernails, and tamarack needles in the open door of the porch. i scratch a blue tip and blow vowels of fire through the living room, the tunneled hallway. flames run up the wooden stairs. i put my ear beside the hot kitchen window to hear the crackling voices of cupboards and walls. i flip the welder's mask: sun off the rectangular glass, a rose glint before the white torch.

 tonight, i am in search of clues on how to be a man, not a man like my father, who traded his motorcycle for a job in the plane yards after my mother left. before my father tried telling me wrestling was fake, we watched men scrap with brass knuckles and bull ropes. back then, a dude could get his jaw broke calling the wrong guy a fake. lou thesz was a bona fide grappler, stretching men with that toehold facelock, snapping men’s elbows to protect his championship belt. my grandfather saw him lose the title to bronko nagurski, celebrated footballer who stomped men into the turf on his way to the end zone. before my father died, he insisted my grandfather never saw that match, that men always invent things when they have something genuine to say. today, everyone knows that fight was fixed. tonight, i am thinking about all those shapes lou thesz could twist out of a man’s skeleton, and how some nights that just isn’t enough.

 so i would hear out those lungs, the air split into nine levels, some gift of tongues of the whistler  in the invalid’s bed: my mother, warbling all day to herself the thousand variations of one song;  it is called buckdancer’s choice. for years, they have all been dying out, the classic buck-and-wing men  of traveling minstrel shows; with them also an old woman was dying of breathless angina,  yet still found breath enough to whistle up in my head a sight like a one-man band,  freed black, with cymbals at heel, an ex-slave who thrivingly danced to the ring of his own clashing light  through the thousand variations of one song all day to my mother’s prone music, the invalid’s warbler’s note,  while i crept close to the wall sock-footed, to hear the sounds alter, her tongue like a mockingbird’s break  through stratum after stratum of a tone proclaiming what choices there are for the last dancers of their kind,  for ill women and for all slaves of death, and children enchanted at walls with a brass-beating glow underfoot,  not dancing but nearly risen through barnlike, theatrelike houses on the wings of the buck and wing.

 lands on my pretty man’s forearm. harmless, it isn’t deadly at all; makes his muscle flutter — the one that gets his hand to hold mine, or ball into a fist, or handle a gun. it’s a ladybug, or an asian lady beetle everyone mistakes for a ladybug — eating whatever it lands on. my pretty man is asleep — at ease, or plotting like the bug. or maybe the bug is a blowfly — eating my pretty man’s tan from his pretty arm. my man swats it without waking, as if he’s dreaming of an enemy, or me. when my pretty man isn’t asleep he’s got a temper.   no, he is not  asleep. he’s wide awake and wants me to tell you i’m wrong. blowflies don’t eat skin, they lay eggs on skin. he knows all about blowfly larvae. napoleon used them to clean war wounds, my cold pretty man says in that pretty way, with his cold pretty mouth. he’s eaten plenty of bugs before. on night watch, over there. over there, they’re everywhere.

 aunt mildred tied up her petticoats with binder’s twine, and my great-uncle ezekiel waxed and waxed his moustaches into flexibility. it was the whole family off then into the dangerous continent of air  and while the salesman with the one gold eyetooth told us the cords at our ankles were guaranteed to stretch to their utmost and then bring us safely back to the fried chicken and scalloped potatoes of sunday dinner  nobody quite believed. edwina, my father’s half sister by my grandfather’s marriage to a former dance hall girl, who got her doctorate in tensor evaluation, she said whole galaxies have been known to belch and disappear  taking with them the king charles spaniels and the gold- plated fire hydrants from where the fire finally stopped in the earthquake year. but it was no good growing roots into the vegetable garden, not after the monarch  butterflies flew up into one whirling vortex and blanked out of immediate space, it was no good hoping ken and barbie, sexless, would anchor us to our interchangeable faces, or that our feet  those flat independent anemones, could grip forever. the salesman smiled, with his face the size of the empire state and growing bigger and bigger and into and through the face aunt mildred went  shouting “banzai!” into great-uncle ezekiel’s inherited ear trumpet, shredding it to tin ribbons, and edwina, dressed in the full commencement robes of the university of massachusetts at amherst, and  mother and father wrapped in each other’s reminiscences, and the goldfish, and finally i went too, out of the mold my body had been formed in and inhabited, as if place were the only realization of person  and either the cords snapped, as any sceptic might have expected, or they are stretched out finer than a human hair, that keeps growing after death, even in the black melting that may or may not be the tight coral beach beyond.

 my mother loves butter more than i do, more than anyone. she pulls chunks off the stick and eats it plain, explaining cream spun around into butter! growing up we ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon and butter, butter and cheese on green noodles, butter melting in small pools in the hearts of yorkshire puddings, butter better than gravy staining white rice yellow, butter glazing corn in slipping squares, butter the lava in white volcanoes of hominy grits, butter softening in a white bowl to be creamed with white sugar, butter disappearing into whipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple, butter melted and curdy to pour over pancakes, butter licked off the plate with warm alaga syrup. when i picture the good old days i am grinning greasy with my brother, having watched the tiger chase his tail and turn to butter. we are mumbo and jumbo’s children despite historical revision, despite our parent’s efforts, glowing from the inside out, one hundred megawatts of butter.

 slowly and with persistence he eats away at the big steak, gobbles up the asparagus, its butter &amp; salt &amp; root taste, drinks at a glass of red wine, and carefully taking his time, mops up the gravy with bread— the top of the café filtre is copper, passively shines back, &amp; between mouthfuls of steak, sips of wine, he remembers at intervals to with the flat of his hand the top removed, bang at the apparatus, create the suction that the water will fall through more quickly  across the tiles of the floor, the cat comes to the table  :  again. “i’ve already given you one piece of steak, what do you want from me now? love?” he strokes her head, her rounded black pregnant head, her greedy front paws slip from his knee, the pearl of great price ignored  .  she’s bored, he bangs the filtre again, its top is copper passively shines back  . food &amp; wine nearly finished. he lifts the whole apparatus off the cup  .  merciful god, will it never be done?                      too cold already to add cream and sugar, he offers the last piece of steak with his fingers  . she accepts it with calm dignity, even delicacy  .  the coffee goes down at a gulp, it is black &amp; lukewarm  .

 high at the window in her cage the old canary flits and sings, nor sees across the curtain pass the shadow of a swallow’s wings.  a poor deceit and copy, this, of larger lives that mark their span, unreckoning of wider worlds or gifts that heaven keeps for man.  she gathers piteous bits and shreds, this solitary, mateless thing, to patient build again the nest so rudely scattered spring by spring;  and sings her brief, unlisted songs, her dreams of bird life wild and free, yet never beats her prison bars at sound of song from bush or tree.  but in my busiest hours i pause, held by a sense of urgent speech, bewildered by that spark-like soul, able my very soul to reach.  she will be heard; she chirps me loud, when i forget those gravest cares, her small provision to supply, clear water or her seedsman’s wares.  she begs me now for that chief joy the round great world is made to grow,— her wisp of greenness. hear her chide, because my answering thought is slow!  what can my life seem like to her? a dull, unpunctual service mine; stupid before her eager call, her flitting steps, her insight fine.  to open wide thy prison door, poor friend, would give thee to thy foes; and yet a plaintive note i hear, as if to tell how slowly goes  the time of thy long prisoning. bird! does some promise keep thee sane? will there be better days for thee? will thy soul too know life again?  ah, none of us have more than this: if one true friend green leaves can reach from out some fairer, wider place, and understand our wistful speech!

 in tattered old slippers that toast at the bars, and a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars, away from the world and its toils and its cares, i’ve a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs.  to mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure, but the fire there is bright and the air rather pure; and the view i behold on a sunshiny day is grand through the chimney-pots over the way.  this snug little chamber is cramm’d in all nooks with worthless old nicknacks and silly old books, and foolish old odds and foolish old ends, crack’d bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends.  old armour, prints, pictures, pipes, china (all crack’d), old rickety tables, and chairs broken-backed; a twopenny treasury, wondrous to see; what matter? ’tis pleasant to you, friend, and me.  no better divan need the sultan require, than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire; and ’tis wonderful, surely, what music you get from the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet.  that praying-rug came from a turcoman’s camp; by tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp; a mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn: ’tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon.  long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes, here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times; as we sit in a fog made of rich latakie this chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me.  but of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest, there’s one that i love and i cherish the best: for the finest of couches that’s padded with hair i never would change thee, my cane-bottom’d chair.  'tis a bandy-legg'd, high-shoulder'd, worm-eaten seat, with a creaking old back, and twisted old feet; but since the fair morning when fanny sat there, i bless thee and love thee, old cane-bottom'd chair.  if chairs have but feeling, in holding such charms, a thrill must have pass'd through your wither'd old arms! i look'd, and i long'd, and i wish'd in despair; i wish'd myself turn'd to a cane-bottom'd chair.  it was but a moment she sate in this place, she'd a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face! a smile on her face, and a rose in her hair, and she sate there, and bloom'd in my cane-bottom'd chair.  and so i have valued my chair ever since, like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince; saint fanny, my patroness sweet i declare, the queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair.  when the candles burn low, and the company's gone, in the silence of night as i sit here alone— i sit here alone, but we yet are a pair— my fanny i see in my cane-bottom'd chair.  she comes from the past and revists my room; she looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom; so smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair, and yonder she sits in my cane-bottom'd chair.

of yeddynges he baar outr e ly the pris. his nekk e whit was as the flour-de-lys; ther-to he strong was as a champioun. he knew the tavernes wel in every toun, and everich hostiler and tappester e  bet than a lazar or a beggester e ; for unto swich a worthy man as he acorded nat, as by his facultee, to have with sik e lazars aqueyntaunc e ; it is nat honest, it may nat avaunc e  fór to deelen with no swich poraill e , but al with riche and selleres of vitaill e . and over-al, ther as profit sholde aris e , curteis he was and lowely of servys e . ther nas no man nowher so vertuous. he was the best e beggere in his hous; [and yaf a certeyn ferm e for the graunt, noon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt;] for thogh a wydw e hadd e noght a sho, so plesaunt was his in principio, yet wolde he have a ferthyng er he went e : his purchas was wel bettr e than his rent e . and rage he koude, as it were right a whelp e . in lov e -dayes ther koude he muchel help e , for there he was nat lyk a cloysterer with a thredbare cope, as is a povre scolér, but he was lyk a maister, or a pop e ; of doubl e worstede was his semycop e , that rounded as a belle, out of the press e . somwhat he lips e d for his wantowness e , to make his englissh sweete upon his tong e ; and in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe, his eyen twynkl e d in his heed aryght as doon the sterr e s in the frosty nyght. this worthy lymytour was cleped hubérd.  a marchant was ther with a fork e d berd, in mott e leye, and hye on horse he sat; upon his heed a flaundryssh bevere hat; his boot e s clasp e d faire and fetisly. his resons he spak ful solémpn e ly, sownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng. he wolde the see were kept for any thing bitwix e middelburgh and or e well e . wel koude he in eschaung e sheeld e s sell e . this worthy man ful wel his wit bisett e ; ther wist e no wight that he was in dett e , so estatly was he of his gouvernaunc e , with his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunc e . for sothe he was a worthy man with-all e , but, sooth to seyn, i noot how men hym call e .  a clerk ther was of oxenford also, that unto logyk hadd e longe y-go. as leen e was his hors as is a rak e , and he nas nat right fat, i undertak e , but look e d holwe, and ther-to sobr e ly. ful thredbare was his overeste court e py; for he hadde geten hym yet no benefic e , ne was so worldly for to have offic e ; for hym was lévere háve at his bedd e s heed twénty book e s, clad in blak or reed, of aristotle and his philosophi e , than rob e s riche, or fíthele, or gay sautri e . but al be that he was a philosophr e , yet hadd e he but litel gold in cofr e ; but al that he myghte of his freend e s hent e  on book e s and on lernynge he it spent e , and bisily gan for the soul e s prey e  of hem that yaf hym wher-with to scoley e . of studie took he moost cure and moost heed e . noght o word spak he moor e than was need e ; and that was seyd in forme and reverenc e , and short and quyk and ful of hy senténc e . sownynge in moral vertu was his spech e ; and gladly wolde he lerne and gladly tech e .  a sergeant of the law e , war and wys, that often hadd e been at the parvys, ther was also, ful riche of excellenc e . discreet he was, and of greet reverenc e — he sem e d swich, his word e s weren so wis e . justice he was ful often in assis e , by patente, and by pleyn commiss i oun. for his science and for his heigh renoun, of fees and rob e s hadde he many oon. so greet a purchasour was nowher noon: al was fee symple to hym in effect; his purchasyng myght e nat been infect. nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas, and yet he sem e d bisier than he was. in term e s hadde he caas and doom e s all e  that from the tyme of kyng william were fall e . ther-to he koude endite and make a thyng, ther koud e no wight pynche at his writyng; and every statut koude he pleyn by rot e . he rood but hoomly in a medlee cot e , girt with a ceint of silk, with barr e s smal e ; of his array telle i no lenger tal e .  a frank e leyn was in his compaigny e . whit was his berd as is the day e sy e ; of his complex i oun he was sangwyn. wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn; to lyven in delit was evere his won e , for he was epicurus owen e son e , that heeld opin i oun that pleyn delit was verraily felicitee parfit. an housholdere, and that a greet, was he; seint julian he was in his contree. his breed, his ale, was alweys after oon; a bettre envyn e d man was nowher noon. without e bak e mete was nevere his hous, of fissh and flessh, and that so plent e vous, it snew e d in his hous of mete and drynk e , of all e deyntees that men koud e thynk e , after the sondry sesons of the yeer; so chaung e d he his mete and his soper. ful many a fat partrich hadde he in muw e , and many a breem and many a luce in stuw e . wo was his cook but if his sauc e wer e  poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geer e . his table dormant in his halle alway stood redy cover e d al the long e day. at sessiouns ther was he lord and sir e ; ful oft e tyme he was knyght of the shir e . an anlaas, and a gipser al of silk, heeng at his girdel, whit as morn e milk. a shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; was nowher such a worthy vavasour.  an haberdasshere, and a carpenter, a webbe, a dyere, and a tapycer,— and they were cloth e d alle in o lyveree of a solémpne and a greet fraternitee. ful fressh and newe hir geere apik e d was;

for catel hadd e they ynogh and rent e , and eek hir wyv e s wolde it wel assent e , and ell e s certeyn wer e they to blam e . it is ful fair to been y-cleped madam e , and goon to vigili e s al bifor e , and have a mantel roialliche y-bor e .  a cook they hadd e with hem for the non e s, to boille the chikn e s with the marybon e s, and poudr e -marchant tart, and galyngal e . wel koude he knowe a draughte of londoun al e . he koud e rooste, and sethe, and broille, and fry e , máken mortreux, and wel bake a py e . but greet harm was it, as it thought e me, that on his shyne a mormal hadd e he; for blankmanger, that made he with the best e .  a shipman was ther, wonynge fer by west e ; for aught i woot he was of dert e mouthe. he rood upon a rouncy, as he kouth e , in a gowne of faldyng to the knee. a daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he aboute his nekke, under his arm adoun. the hoot e somer hadde maad his hewe al broun; and certeinly he was a good felaw e . ful many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-draw e  fro burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep. of nyc e consc i ence took he no keep. if that he faught and hadde the hyer hond, by water he sente hem hoom to every lond. but of his craft to rekene wel his tyd e s, his strem e s, and his daungers hym bisid e s, his herberwe and his moone, his lode-menag e , ther nas noon swich from hull e to cartag e . hardy he was and wys to undertak e ; with many a tempest hadde his berd been shak e . he knew all e the haven e s, as they wer e , from gootlond to the cape of fynyster e , and every cryke in britaigne and in spayn e . his barge y-clep e d was the maud e layn e .  with us ther was a doctour of phisik; in all this world ne was ther noon hym lik, to speke of phisik and of surgery e ; for he was grounded in astronomy e . he kepte his pac i ent a ful greet deel in hour e s, by his magyk natureel. wel koude he fortunen the ascendent of his ymáges for his pac i ent. he knew the cause of everich malady e , were it of hoot, or cold, or moyste, or dry e , and where they engendred and of what humour. he was a verray, parfit praktisour; the cause y-knowe, and of his harm the root e , anon he yaf the sik e man his boot e . ful redy hadde he his apothecari e s to sende him drogg e s and his letuari e s; for ech of hem made oother for to wynn e , hir frendshipe nas nat new e to bigynn e . wel knew he the old e esculapius, and de{"y}scorides, and eek rufus, old ypocras, haly, and galyen, serapion, razis, and avycen, averrois, damascien, and constantyn, bernard, and gat e sden, and gilbertyn. of his diet e mesurable was he, for it was of no superfluitee, but of greet norissyng and digestíbl e . his studie was but litel on the bibl e . in sangwyn and in pers he clad was al, lyn e d with taffata and with sendal. and yet he was but esy of dispenc e ; he kept e that he wan in pestilenc e . for gold in phisik is a cord i al; therfore he lov e de gold in spec i al.  a good wif was ther of bisid e bath e , but she was som-del deef, and that was scath e . of clooth-makyng she hadd e swich an haunt she pass e d hem of ypr e s and of gaunt. in al the parisshe wif ne was ther noon that to the offrynge bifore hire shold e goon; and if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was she that she was out of all e charitee. hir coverchiefs ful fyn e weren of ground; i dorst e swere they wey e den ten pound that on a sonday weren upon hir heed. hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed, ful streite y-teyd, and shoes ful moyste and new e . boold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hew e . she was a worthy womman al hir lyv e ; housbondes at chirch e dore she hadd e fyv e , withouten oother compaignye in youth e ; but ther-of nedeth nat to speke as nowth e . and thri e s hadde she been at jérusalem; she hadd e pass e d many a straung e strem; at rome she hadd e been, and at boloign e , in galice at seint jame, and at coloign e . she koud e muchel of wandrynge by the wey e . gat-toth e d was she, soothly for to sey e . upon an amblere esily she sat, y-wympl e d wel, and on hir heed an hat as brood as is a bokeler or a targ e ; a foot-mantel aboute hir hip e s larg e , and on hire feet a paire of spor e s sharp e . in felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carp e ; of remedies of love she knew per chauncé, for she koude of that art the old e daunc e .  a good man was ther of relig i oun, and was a povr e person of a toun; but riche he was of hooly thoght and werk. he was also a lern e d man, a clerk, that crist e s gospel trew e ly wolde prech e ; his parisshens devoutly wolde he tech e . benygne he was, and wonder diligent, and in adversitee ful pac i ent; and swich he was y-prev e d oft e sith e s. ful looth were hym to cursen for his tith e s, but rather wolde he yeven, out of dout e , unto his povr e parisshens about e , of his offrýng and eek of his substaunc e ; he koude in litel thyng have suffisaunc e . wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder, but he ne laft e nat, for reyn ne thonder, in siknesse nor in meschief to visít e  the ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lit e , upon his feet, and in his hand a staf. this noble ensampl e to his sheep he yaf, that first he wroghte and afterward he taught e . out of the gospel he tho word e s caught e ; and this figure he added eek therto, that if gold rust e , what shal iren doo? for if a preest be foul, on whom we trust e , no wonder is a lew e d man to rust e ; and shame it is, if a prest tak e keep, a shiten shepherde and a clen e sheep. wel oghte a preest ensampl e for to yiv e  by his clennesse how that his sheep sholde lyv e . he sett e nat his benefice to hyr e  and leet his sheep encombr e d in the myr e , and ran to londoun, unto seint e poul e s, to seken hym a chaunterie for soul e s, or with a bretherhed to been withhold e ; but dwelte at hoom and kept e wel his fold e , so that the wolf ne made it nat myscari e ; he was a shepherde, and noght a mercenari e . and though he hooly were and vertuous, he was to synful man nat despitous, ne of his spech e daungerous ne dign e , but in his techyng díscreet and benygn e . to drawen folk to hevene by fairness e , by good ensample, this was his bisyness e . but it were any persone obstinat, what so he were, of heigh or lough estat, hym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys. a bettr e preest i trowe that nowher noon ys. he waited after no pompe and reverenc e , ne maked him a spic e d conscienc e ; but crist e s loore and his apostl e s twelv e  he taughte, but first he folw e d it hymselv e .  with hym ther was a plowman, was his brother, that hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother; a trew e swynkere and a good was he, lyvynge in pees and parfit charitee. god loved he best, with al his hool e hert e , at all e tym e s, thogh him gamed or smert e . and thanne his neigh e bor right as hymselv e . he wold e thresshe, and therto dyke and delv e , for cristes sake, for every povr e wight, withouten hire, if it lay in his myght. his tith e s pay e de he ful faire and wel, bothe of his propr e swynk and his catel. in a tabard he rood upon a mer e .  ther was also a reve and a miller e , a somnour and a pardoner also, a maunciple, and myself,—ther were namo.  the millere was a stout carl for the non e s; ful byg he was of brawn and eek of bon e s. that prov e d wel, for over-al, ther he cam, at wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram. he was short-sholdr e d, brood, a thikk e knarr e ; ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harr e , or breke it at a rennyng with his heed. his berd as any sowe or fox was reed, and therto brood, as though it were a spad e . upon the cop right of his nose he had e  a werte, and thereon stood a toft of herys, reed as the brustl e s of a sow e s erys; his nos e thirl e s blak e were and wyd e . a swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syd e . his mouth as greet was as a greet forneys; he was a janglere and a goliardeys, and that was moost of synne and harlotri e s. wel koude he stelen corn and tollen thri e s; and yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee. a whit cote and a blew hood wer e d he. a bagg e pipe wel koude he blowe and sowne, and therwithal he broghte us out of town e .  a gentil maunciple was ther of a templ e , of which achátours myght e take exempl e  for to be wise in byynge of vitaill e ; for, wheither that he payde or took by taill e , algate he wayted so in his achaat that he was ay biforn and in good staat. now is nat that of god a ful fair grac e , that swich a lew e d mann e s wit shal pac e  the wisdom of an heep of lern e d men? of maistr e s hadde he mo than thri e s ten, that weren of lawe expert and curious, of whiche ther weren a duszeyne in that hous worthy to been stywardes of rente and lond of any lord that is in eng e lond, to maken hym lyv e by his propr e good, in honour dettelees, but if he were wood, or lyve as scarsly as hym list desir e ; and abl e for to helpen al a shir e  in any caas that myght e falle or happ e ; and yet this manciple sette hir aller capp e   the rev e was a sclendre colerik man. his berd was shave as ny as ever he kan; his heer was by his erys round y-shorn; his top was dokk e d lyk a preest biforn. ful long e were his legg e s and ful len e , y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sen e . wel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynn e ; ther was noon auditour koude on him wynn e . wel wiste he, by the droghte and by the reyn, the yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn. his lord e s sheep, his neet, his day e ry e , his swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultry e , was hoolly in this rev e s governyng; and by his covenant yaf the rekenyng syn that his lord was twenty yeer of ag e ; there koude no man brynge hym in arrerag e . there nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyn e , that he ne knew his sleighte and his covyn e ; they were adrad of hym as of the deeth. his wonyng was ful fair upon an heeth; with gren e tre e s shadw e d was his plac e . he koud e bettr e than his lord purchac e ; ful riche he was a-stor e d pryv e ly. his lord wel koude he plesen subtilly, to yeve and lene hym of his owen e good, and have a thank, and yet a cote and hood. in youthe he hadd e lerned a good myster; he was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter. this rev e sat upon a ful good stot, that was al pomely grey, and hight e scot. a long surcote of pers upon he had e , and by his syde he baar a rusty blad e . of northfolk was this reve of which i tell e , biside a toun men clepen bald e swell e . tukk e d he was as is a frere, about e . and evere he rood the hyndreste of oure rout e .  a somonour was ther with us in that place, that hadde a fyr-reed cherubynn e s fac e , for sawc e fleem he was, with eyen narw e . as hoot he was and lecherous as a sparw e , with scal e d brow e s blake and pil e d berd,— of his visag e children were aferd. ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon, boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartr e noon, ne oyn e ment that wold e clense and byt e , that hym myghte helpen of his whelk e s whit e , nor of the knobb e s sittynge on his chek e s. wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lek e s, and for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood. thanne wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood. and whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn, than wolde he spek e no word but latyn. a few e term e s hadde he, two or thre, that he had lern e d out of som decree,— no wonder is, he herde it al the day; and eek ye knowen wel how that a jay kan clepen "watte" as wel as kan the pope. but whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope, thanne hadde he spent al his philosophi e ; ay "questio quid juris" wolde he cri e . he was a gentil harlot and a kynd e ; a bettr e felawe sholde men noght fynde. he wold e suffr e for a quart of wyn a good felawe to have his concubyn a twelf month, and excuse hym att e full e ; and priv e ly a fynch eek koude he pulle. and if he foond owher a good felaw e , he wold e techen him to have noon awe, in swich caas, of the erch e deken e s curs, but if a mann e s soule were in his purs; for in his purs he sholde y-punysshed be: "purs is the erch e deken e s helle," seyde he. but wel i woot he ly e d right in ded e . of cursyng oghte ech gilty man him dred e , for curs wol slee, right as assoillyng savith; and also war him of a significavit. in daunger hadde he at his owen e gise the yong e girl e s of the diocis e , and knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed. a gerland hadde he set upon his heed, as greet as it were for an al e -stak e ; a bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cak e .  with hym ther rood a gentil pardoner of rouncivale, his freend and his compeer, that streight was comen fro the court of rom e . ful loude he soong, "com hider, lov e , to me!" this somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun; was nevere trompe of half so greet a soun. this pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, but smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex; by ounces henge his lokk e s that he hadd e , and therwith he his shuldr e s overspradd e . but thynne it lay, by colpons, oon and oon; but hood, for jolitee, wer e d he noon, for it was truss e d up in his walét. hym thoughte he rood al of the new e jet; dischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bar e . swiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an har e . a vernycle hadde he sowed upon his capp e . his walet lay biforn hym in his lapp e , bret-ful of pardoun, comen from rome al hoot. a voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot. no berd hadde he, ne nevere shold e hav e , as smothe it was as it were late y-shav e ; i trowe he were a geldyng or a mar e . but of his craft, fro berwyk into war e , ne was ther swich another pardoner; for in his male he hadde a pilw e -beer, which that, he seyd e , was oure lady veyl; he seyde he hadde a gobet of the seyl that seint e peter hadde, whan that he went e  upon the see, til jesu crist hym hent e . he hadde a croys of latoun, ful of ston e s, and in a glas he hadd e pigg e s bon e s. but with thise relik e s, whan that he fond a povr e person dwellynge upon lond, upon a day he gat hym moore money e  than that the person gat in month e s twey e ; and thus with feyn e d flaterye and jap e s he made the person and the peple his ap e s. but trew e ly to tellen att e last e , he was in chirche a noble ecclesiast e ; wel koude he rede a lessoun or a stori e , but alderbest he song an offertori e ; for wel he wist e , whan that song was song e , he moste preche, and wel affile his tong e  to wynn e silver, as he ful wel koud e ; therefore he song the murierly and loud e .  now have i toold you shortly, in a claus e , thestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the caus e  why that assembl e d was this compaigny e  in southwerk, at this gentil hostelry e  that highte the tabard, fast e by the bell e . but now is tym e to yow for to tell e  how that we baren us that ilk e nyght, whan we were in that hostelrie alyght; and after wol i telle of our viag e  and al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimag e .  but first, i pray yow, of youre curteisy e , that ye narette it nat my vileyny e , thogh that i pleynly speke in this mateer e , to tell e yow hir word e s and hir cheer e , ne thogh i speke hir word e s propr e ly. for this ye knowen al-so wel as i, whoso shal telle a tale after a man, he moot reherce, as ny as evere he kan, everich a word, if it be in his charg e , al speke he never so rud e liche and larg e ; or ellis he moot telle his tale untrew e , or feyn e thyng, or fynd e word e s new e . he may nat spare, althogh he were his brother; he moot as wel seye o word as another. crist spak hymself ful brode in hooly writ, and wel ye woot no vileynye is it. eek plato seith, whoso kan hym red e , "the word e s moote be cosyn to the ded e ."  also i prey yow to foryeve it me, al have i nat set folk in hir degree heere in this tale, as that they shold e stond e ; my wit is short, ye may wel understond e .  greet chier e made oure hoost us everichon, and to the soper sette he us anon, and serv e d us with vitaille at the best e : strong was the wyn and wel to drynke us lest e .  a semely man oure hoost e was with-all e  for to been a marchal in an hall e . a large man he was with eyen step e , a fairer burgeys was ther noon in chep e ; boold of his speche, and wys, and well y-taught, and of manhod hym lakk e d e right naught. eek thereto he was right a myrie man, and after soper pleyen he bigan, and spak of myrthe among e s other e thyng e s, whan that we hadd e maad our rekenyng e s; and seyd e thus: "now, lordynges, trew e ly, ye been to me right welcome, hert e ly; for by my trouthe, if that i shal nat ly e , i saugh nat this yeer so myrie a compaigny e  at on e s in this herberwe as is now. fayn wolde i doon yow myrth e , wiste i how;

 i sat on the dogana’s steps for the gondolas cost too much, that year, and there were not “those girls”, there was one face, and the buccentoro twenty yards off, howling, “stretti”, and the lit cross-beams, that year, in the morosini, and peacocks in koré’s house, or there may have been. gods float in the azure air, bright gods and tuscan, back before dew was shed. light: and the first light, before ever dew was fallen. panisks, and from the oak, dryas, and from the apple, mælid, through all the wood, and the leaves are full of voices, a-whisper, and the clouds bowe over the lake, and there are gods upon them, and in the water, the almond-white swimmers, the silvery water glazes the upturned nipple, as poggio has remarked. green veins in the turquoise, or, the gray steps lead up under the cedars.  my cid rode up to burgos, up to the studded gate between two towers, beat with his lance butt, and the child came out, una niña de nueve años, to the little gallery over the gate, between the towers, reading the writ, voce tinnula: that no man speak to, feed, help ruy diaz, on pain to have his heart out, set on a pike spike and both his eyes torn out, and all his goods sequestered, “and here, myo cid, are the seals, the big seal and the writing.” and he came down from bivar, myo cid, with no hawks left there on their perches, and no clothes there in the presses, and left his trunk with raquel and vidas, that big box of sand, with the pawn-brokers, to get pay for his menie; breaking his way to valencia. ignez de castro murdered, and a wall here stripped, here made to stand. drear waste, the pigment flakes from the stone, or plaster flakes, mantegna painted the wall. silk tatters, “nec spe nec metu.”

 a fourth was needed so one of the three invited a friend and i came along as a spare in case a chair was empty since i could fill in as easily as i could shout out a rhyme.  as the jive flowed like the river jordan and joshua and his trumpets sounded the alarm the winning cards slam damned on the table and i laughed along with morning noon and night.  my three big brothers: bold smart handsome. one slim as a stick of dynamite, the second solid as a line backer and the third crazy enough to fight them both if they let it roll beyond talk.  treated me like a child even after i had my first. the three of them (ace king and a wild card) improbably born within four years as if daddy and momma were trying to break a record  or win a bet about how many diapers a woman could change in a single day without cursing the hand god had dealt her; the odds were even until i came along years later to tell their story.

 trees in the old days used to stand and shape a shady lane where lovers wandered hand in hand who came from carentan.  this was the shining green canal where we came two by two walking at combat-interval. such trees we never knew.  the day was early june, the ground was soft and bright with dew. far away the guns did sound, but here the sky was blue.  the sky was blue, but there a smoke hung still above the sea where the ships together spoke to towns we could not see.  could you have seen us through a glass you would have said a walk of farmers out to turn the grass, each with his own hay-fork.  the watchers in their leopard suits waited till it was time, and aimed between the belt and boot and let the barrel climb.  i must lie down at once, there is a hammer at my knee. and call it death or cowardice, don’t count again on me.  everything’s all right, mother, everyone gets the same at one time or another. it’s all in the game.  i never strolled, nor ever shall, down such a leafy lane. i never drank in a canal, nor ever shall again.  there is a whistling in the leaves and it is not the wind, the twigs are falling from the knives that cut men to the ground.  tell me, master-sergeant, the way to turn and shoot. but the sergeant’s silent that taught me how to do it.  o captain, show us quickly our place upon the map. but the captain’s sickly and taking a long nap.  lieutenant, what’s my duty, my place in the platoon? he too’s a sleeping beauty, charmed by that strange tune.  carentan o carentan before we met with you we never yet had lost a man or known what death could do.

 smoketrees line the roadside, still-bare beech and poplar bouqueted with redbud and something rusty i can't name, march's odd autumnals —  one-church towns i'm glad not to be from, split-log strip mall with a porch where claire's beauty shop shares a sign with "antigues," where you study grace in magazines, and when dad dies you rename the family diner  new york new york. love is a means of travel, so you dye the linens pink and swan-fold napkins, holding peony in your mouth. sundays drive out to watch the ferry drag its lace.  coastward, easter-colored clapboard, the last generation's shanties hovering on narrow stilts above the velour drift of tide plain (mink from a distance,  muskrat up close), a drowsy instrumental music, flooded at dusk. beside the bridge, smooth brow of pewter. island of saplings blackened like a framed-up house.

 something has come between us— it will not sleep. every night it rises like a fish out of the deep.  it cries with a human voice, it aches to be fed. every night we heave it weeping into our bed,  with its heavy head lolled back, its limbs hanging down, like a mer-creature fetched up from the weeds of the drowned.  damp in the tidal dark, it whimpers, tossing the cover, separating husband from wife, lover from lover.  it settles in the interstice, it spreads out its arms, while its cool underwater face sharpens and warms:  this is the third thing that makes father and mother, the fierce love of our fashioning that will have no brother.

 i know him, that man walking- toward me up the crowded street of the city, i have lived with him seven years now, i know his fast stride, his windy wheatfield hair, his hands thrust deep in his jacket pockets, hands that have known my body, touched its softest part, caused its quick shudders and slow releasings, i have seen his face above my face, his mouth smiling, moaning his eyes closed and opened, i have studied his eyes, the brown turning gold at the centers, i have silently watched him lying beside me in the early morning, i know his loneliness, like mine, human and sad, but different, too, his private pain and pleasure i can never enter even as he comes closer, past trees and cars, trash and flowers, steam rising from the manhole covers, gutters running with rain, he lifts his head, he sees me, we are strangers again, and a rending music of desire and loss— i don’t know him—courses through me, and we kiss and say,it’s good to see you, as if we haven’t seen each other in years when it was just a few hours ago, and we are shy, then, not knowing what to say next.

 standing in front of a mirror, my mother tells me she is ugly says the medication is making her fat. i laugh &amp; walk her back to the bed. my mother tells me she is ugly in the same voice she used to say no woman could love you&amp; i watch her pull at her body &amp; it is mine. my heavy breast. my disappointing shape. she asks for a bowl of plain broth &amp; it becomes the cup of vinegar she would pour down my throat. everyday after school, i would kneel before her. i would remove my clothes &amp; ask her to mark the progress. it’s important that i mention, i truly wanted to be beautiful for her. in my dreams i am thin &amp; if not thin, something better. i tell my mother she is still beautiful &amp; she laughs. the room fills with flies. they gather in the shape of a small boy. they lead her back to the mirror, but my reflection is still there.

 turning your back, you button your blouse. that’s new. you redirect the conversation. a man has entered it. your therapist has given you permission to discuss this with me, the word you’ve been looking for in desire. you can now say “heterosexual” with me. we mean  different things when we say it. i mean the life i left behind forever. for you, it’s a new beginning, a stab at being normal again, a desire to enter the world with a man instead of a woman, and of course, there’s the word you won’t claim for yourself anymore, you  who have children to think of, you who have put me in line behind them and mean to keep the order clear. it’s really my word against yours anymore in this new language, in this battle over how a man is about to enter this closed room of desire  we’ve gingerly exchanged keys to, but desire isn’t what’s at issue anyway, you say to me. instead i learn a man can protect you in a way a woman only means to but never can, and my world is too new when there’s real life out there, word  after word for how normal looks, each word cutting like scissors a profile of desire— a man facing a woman, nothing particularly new or interesting to me. i’ve wanted only to face you and the world simultaneously, say what i mean with my body, my choice to not be a man,  to be a woman with you, forget the man’s part or how his body is the word for what touch can contain, what love means. if this were only about desire, you say, i’d still desire you. but it isn’t passion we’re defining, new  consequences emerge when a man and desire are part of the words we hurl, you changing how you mean loving—this terrible final news.

 for my parents, choi inyeong &amp; nam songeun in the first grade i asked my mother permission to go by frances at school. at seven years old,  i already knew the exhaustion of hearing my name butchered by hammerhead tongues. already knew  to let my salty gook name drag behind me in the sand, safely out of sight. in fourth grade  i wanted to be a writer &amp; worried about how to escape my surname — choi  is nothing if not korean, if not garlic breath, if not seaweed &amp; sesame &amp; food stamps  during the lean years — could i go by f.j.c.? could i be paper thin &amp; raceless? dust jacket &amp; coffee stain,  boneless rumor smoldering behind the curtain &amp; speaking through an ink-stained puppet?  my father ran through all his possible rechristenings — ian, isaac, ivan — and we laughed at each one,  knowing his accent would always give him away. you can hear the pride in my mother’s voice  when she answers the phone this is grace, &amp; it is some kind of strange grace she’s spun herself,  some lightning made of chain mail. grace is not her pseudonym, though everyone in my family is a poet.  these are the shields for the names we speak in the dark to remember our darkness. savage death rites  we still practice in the new world. myths we whisper to each other to keep warm. my korean name  is the star my mother cooks into the jjigae to follow home when i am lost, which is always  in this gray country, this violent foster home whose streets are paved with shame, this factory yard  riddled with bullies ready to steal your skin &amp; sell it back to your mother for profit,  land where they stuff our throats with soil &amp; accuse us of gluttony when we learn to swallow it.  i confess. i am greedy. i think i deserve to be seen for what i am: a boundless, burning wick.  a minor chord. i confess: if someone has looked at my crooked spine and called it elmwood,  i’ve accepted. if someone has loved me more for my gook name, for my saint name,  for my good vocabulary &amp; bad joints, i’ve welcomed them into this house.  i’ve cooked them each a meal with a star singing at the bottom of the bowl, a secret ingredient  to follow home when we are lost: sunflower oil, blood sausage, a name  given by your dead grandfather who eventually forgot everything he’d touched. i promise:  i’ll never stop stealing back what’s mine. i promise: i won’t forget again.

 the crow call this time of year the black cherry moon when the rose hips are blood-bright, spattered on their overwrought stems, and the creek calls so clearly in words almost our own as we come sliding down the bank. last night, we covered the gardens in plastic. the chickadees were back after their wide diet of summer. we ate the last trout, its spine curved from disease. so much can go wrong, i want to know what you will promise me as our hands reach in and in through the copper, the carmine leaves. i know you are lonely, alone with your grief for your parents who are not my parents, for your life, which, despite all, is not my life. the cherries are thick here, hanging in clusters, purple-black from frost. it started to rain and i am chilled by it. each day, we promise, we will talk of our fears of intimacy, how we still expect to be hurt when we love. you bring me a coat from the back of the truck, but i want to stop our task now, to sit in the cab of the truck while the gray spills, slick with thunder. what if i kissed you there in depth. after so many years, i can misunderstand the difference between instinct and obligation, how my hand continues to grasp the stems. keats said poems should come easy as leaves off the trees, but see how they cling and wrestle with their ties. and now, the sun shines. it is not this grace i had imagined. when keats said poems, i meant love. the chokecherries roll easily into my palm, then fall into the plastic bag that binds my writs. over and over, until we have enough, until our fingers are bruised with their dark juices.

 we assemble the silver tree, our translated lives, its luminous branches, numbered to fit into its body. place its metallic roots to decorate our first christmas. mother finds herself opening, closing the red cross box she will carry into 1976 like an unwanted door prize, a timepiece, a stubborn fact, an emblem of exile measuring our days, marked by the moment of our departure, our lives no longer arranged.  somewhere, there is a photograph, a polaroid mother cannot remember was ever taken: i am sitting under tia tere’s christmas tree, her first apartment in this, our new world: my sisters by my side, i wear a white dress, black boots, an eight-year-old’s resignation; mae and mitzy, age four, wear red and white snowflake sweaters and identical smiles, on this, our first christmas, away from ourselves.  the future unreal, unmade, mother will cry into the new year with lidia and emerito, our elderly downstairs neighbors, who realize what we are too young to understand: even a map cannot show you the way back to a place that no longer exists.  
NEW POEM
 he gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and i could stand amused all afternoon in the hon kee grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh i know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass. i step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick.  such a sorrowful chinese face, nomad, gobi, northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. he could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. in his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he’d mumble his favorite passages. he could be my grandfather; come to america to get a western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother.  he lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel.  the head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and i see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death? is this how i, too, recoil from my day? see how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. see its grease on the blade. is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open. is this how i presided over my century, is this how i regarded the murders? this is also how i prayed. was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed? this too was how i slept, clutching my wife. was it me in the other i loved when i loved another? the butcher sees me eye this delicacy. with a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. i eat my man.  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover’s heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. these are the faces i love, the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day’s end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands.  brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. in a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. all are beautiful by variety. the soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. god is the text. the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic.  a bright moment, i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me, and i feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. what is it in me would devour the world to utter it? what is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. i would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man’s hands, i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, i would eat it all to utter it. the deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, i would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these chinatown deaths, these american deaths. i would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world.

 "love seeketh not itself to please, nor for itself hath any care, but for another gives its ease, and builds a heaven in hell's despair."  so sung a little clod of clay trodden with the cattle's feet, but a pebble of the brook warbled out these metres meet:  "love seeketh only self to please, to bind another to its delight, joys in another's loss of ease, and builds a hell in heaven's despite."

 bending, i bow my head and lay my hands upon her hair, combing, and think how women do this for each other. my daughter’s hair curls against the comb, wet and fragrant— orange parings. her face, downcast, is quiet for one so young.  i take her place. beneath my mother’s hands i feel the braids drawn up tight as piano wires and singing, vinegar-rinsed. sitting before the oven i hear the orange coils tick the early hour before school.  she combed her grandmother mathilda’s hair using a comb made out of bone. mathilda rocked her oak wood chair, her face downcast, intent on tearing rags in strips to braid a cotton rug from bits of orange and brown. a simple act preparing hair. something women do for each other, plaiting the generations.

 just look, ’tis quarter past six, love— and not even the fires are caught; well, you know i must be at the office— but, as usual, the breakfast ’ll be late.  now hurry and wake up the children; and dress them as fast as you can; ‘poor dearies,’ i know they’ll be tardy, dear me, ‘what a slow, poky man!’  have the tenderloin broiled nice and juicy— have the toast browned and buttered all right; and be sure you settle the coffee: be sure that the silver is bright.  when ready, just run up and call me— at eight, to the office i go, lest poverty, grim, should o’ertake us— ‘’tis bread and butter,’ you know.  the bottom from stocks may fall out, my bonds may get below par; then surely, i seldom could spare you a nickel, to buy a cigar.  all ready? now, while i am eating, just bring up my wheel to the door; then wash up the dishes; and, mind now, have dinner promptly at four;  for tonight is our woman’s convention, and i am to speak first, you know— the men veto us in private, but in public they shout, ‘that’s so.’  so ‘by-by’ – in case of a rap, love, before opening the door, you must look; o! how could a civilized woman exist, without a man cook.  
NEW POEM
 what is he buzzing in my ears? "now that i come to die, do i view the world as a vale of tears?" ah, reverend sir, not i!  what i viewed there once, what i view again where the physic bottles stand on the table's edge,—is a suburb lane, with a wall to my bedside hand.  that lane sloped, much as the bottles do, from a house you could descry o'er the garden-wall; is the curtain blue or green to a healthy eye?  to mine, it serves for the old june weather blue above lane and wall; and that farthest bottle labelled "ether" is the house o'ertopping all.  at a terrace, somewhere near the stopper, there watched for me, one june, a girl: i know, sir, it's improper, my poor mind's out of tune.  only, there was a way... you crept close by the side, to dodge eyes in the house, two eyes except: they styled their house "the lodge."  what right had a lounger up their lane? but, by creeping very close, with the good wall's help,—their eyes might strain and stretch themselves to oes,  yet never catch her and me together, as she left the attic, there, by the rim of the bottle labelled "ether," and stole from stair to stair,  and stood by the rose-wreathed gate. alas, we loved, sir—used to meet: how sad and bad and mad it was— but then, how it was sweet!  
NEW POEM
 i cannot change, as others do, though you unjustly scorn; since that poor swain, that sighs for you for you alone was born. no, phyllis, no, your heart to move a surer way i’ll try: and to revenge my slighted love, will still love on, will still love on, and die.  when, kill’d with grief, amyntas lies; and you to mind shall call the sighs that now unpitied rise; the tears that vainly fall: that welcome hour that ends this smart, will then begin your pain; for such a faithful, tender heart can never break, can never break in vain.  
NEW POEM
 had no direction to go but up: and this, the shattery road its surface graining, trickle in late thaw—is nothing amiss? —this melt, the sign assures us,natural cycle and whoosh, the water a dream of forgotten white  past aspens colored in sulfur, they trembled, would —poor sinners in redemption song—shed their tainted leaves    i tell you what boy i was, writing lyrics to reflect my passions: the smell of a bare neck in summer a thin trail of hairs disappearing below the top button of cut-offs the lean, arched back of a cyclist straining to ascend a hill  in the starlight i wandered: streets no better than fields the cul-de-sacs of suburbia just as treacherous, just as empty  if wood doves sang in the branches of the acacias, i could not hear them anyone lost in that same night was lost in another tract  the air pulsed and dandelion pollen blew from green stalks —that was all    and yes, someone took me in his car.   and another against the low fence in the park at the end of our block.   under the willow branches where gnats made a furious cloud at dawn and chased us away  i knew how it felt to lie in a patch of marigolds: golden stains the way morning swarmed a hidden rooftop, the catbirds singing the feel of ruin upon lips rubbed raw throughout the night  granite peaks: here, the earth has asserted itself. and the ice asserted and human intimacies conspired to keep us low and apart  for an ice age i knew you only as an idea of longing: a voice in the next yard, whispering through the chink a vagabond outlined against the sky, among the drying grass    we journey this day to darkness: the chasm walls lift us on their scaly backs the glaciers relinquish their secrets: that sound is the ice bowing and the sound underneath, the trickle: the past released, disappearing    you pinnacle of my life, stand with me on this brink half-clouded basin caked in flat grays, the very demise of green  you have surmounted the craggy boundary between us.    you open a place for me in earth, receiving my song   —for haines eason  
NEW POEM
 i sit in my own shadow, she says, the way my mother gave birth to it. in artificial light, blinds drawn against the darkness of power.  i think of you as if you were that shadow, a natural enclosure, a world, not a slight, so i can wander through your darkness. has our contract inverted time, made our universe contract, a cramped bed for two? and when i say your name, do i draw water, a portrait, curtain, bridge, or conclusion?   place there is none, he quotes. not even to hang up our archetypes. let alone star-spangled banners. we go forward and backward, and there is no place. therefore it is a name for god. my eye, steadfast on traffic lights, abolishes the larger part of the round world. i should look at my feet. space sweeps through us, a hell of distances bathed in the feeble glow of emptiness. outward mobility, unimpeded. suddenly we’re nobody home, without any need of inattention, imposture, or talent for deceit.   the wind whips my skin as if it were water, she says. my skin is water. for wind read wind, news, sky falling. is it a mental disturbance or the higher math of love if i hear you talking under my breath and from the torn fragments assume the sun is far away and small, and a look can cause a burn? superstition, too, is a kind of understanding, and to forgo it may have consequences.   clusters of possibilities whiz through our head, he says. electric charges, clogged highway, screeching brakes, a house too full of guests. with grounds for disagreement and miscarriage. the light rushes in dry, screaming. but the opaque parts of the nerve oppose the noise and void the options. then the project must be prolonged in terms of lack.  
NEW POEM
 i can see her in the kitchen, cooking up, for the hundredth time, a little something from her limited midwestern repertoire. cigarette going in the ashtray, the red wine pulsing in its glass, a warning light meaning everything was simmering just below the steel lid of her smile, as she boiled the beef into submission, chopped her way through the vegetable kingdom with the broken-handled knife i use tonight, feeling her anger rising from the dark chambers of the head of cabbage i slice through, missing her, wanting to chew things over with my mother again.  
NEW POEM
 shepherdboy?   not the most salient image for contemporary readers nor most available.   unless you’re thinking brokeback mountain : a reference already escaping.   i did love a montana man, though no good shepherd  rather: a caveman, came spelunking into that grotto i’d retreated to  what light he bore illumined such small space—physically, temporally  and did he have a grove of beech trees? no, no grove but together we found an old-growth stand of   redwood  we gouged each other’s chests instead of wood:   pledges that faded he was not cruel nor i unwitting.   but what endures beyond any thicket?   example: he took me to the ocean to say farewell.   i mean me: farewell to ocean the ocean, for that matter, to me.   us both fatigued, showing signs of wreckage  and that man i had loved stood back from the edge of things  he did not hold me  i expected not to be held  we all understood one another: shepherd understudy, ocean, me   and did he go back to his fields and caves? yes, but they were gone strip-mining, lumber, defoliant, sterile streams: you knew that was coming  weren’t we taught some starched sermon: the pasture awaits us elsewhere   back up a moment: the forest you mentioned—remember, instead of a grove?  untouched for the most part.   some human damage, but not ours  we left no mark, not there in the midst of those great trees: not in the concentric rings that might have held us far past living  instead, i put that man, like so many others, on paper— a tree already gone from sight where once it had drawn the eyes upward: the crest of a mountain.   crumpled thoughts, crumpled love   shepherdboy, do you see the wild fennel bulbs i gathered for you olallieberries, new-mown grass, the tender fruits of   the coastal fig?  i put them on paper, too, so fragile.   for nothing is ever going to last   for haines eason  
NEW POEM
 my boy, not of your will nor mine you keep the mountain pass and wait, restless, for evil gold to shine and hold you to your fate.  a stronger hand than yours gave you the lawless sword—you know not why. that you must live is all too true, and other men must die.  my boy, be brigand if you must, but face the traveller in your track: stand one to one, and never thrust the dagger in his back.  nay, make no ambush of the dark. look straight into your victim’s eyes; then—let his free soul, like a lark, fly, singing, toward the skies.  my boy, if christ must be betrayed, and you must the betrayer be, oh, marked before the worlds were made! what help is there for me?  ah, if the prophets from their graves demand such blood of you as this, take him, i say, with swords and staves, but—never with a kiss!  
NEW POEM
 these lovers’ inklings which our loves enmesh, lost to the cunning and dimensional eye, though tenemented in the selves we see, not more perforce than azure to the sky, were necromancy-juggled to the flesh, and startled from no daylight you or me.  for trance and silvemess those moons commend, which blanch the warm life silver-pale; or look what ghostly portent mist distorts from slight clay shapes; the willows that the waters took liquid and brightened in the waters bend, and we, in love’s reflex, seemed loved of right.  then no more think to net forthwith love’s thing, but cast for it by spirit sleight-of-hand; then only in the slant glass contemplate, where lineament outstripping line is scanned, then on the perplexed text leave pondering, love’s proverb is set down transliterate.  
NEW POEM
 the big front wall that blocks off the courtyard often catches the newborn light of the sun like the side of a barn. the body awakes in the morning to a room, messy and empty, that smells of the first, clumsy perfume. even that body, wrapped now in sheets, is the same that it was when it thrilled in discovery.  her body wakes alone to the extended call of morning, the languor of another morning returning in the heavy shadows: the barn of childhood and the heavy tiredness of sun hot in the indolent doorways. a perfume worked itself into the usual sweat of her hair, a smell the animals knew. her body took secret pleasure in the sun’s suggestive, serene caress—like a real touch.  the languor of bed saps the sprawled limbs, still youthful and plump, like a child’s. the clumsy child used to smell the mixed scent of tobacco and hay, used to tremble when touched by the man’s quick hands: she liked playing games. sometimes she played lying down with the man in the hay, but he wasn’t smelling her hair: he’d find her closed legs in the hay and pry them open, then crush her like he was her father. the perfume was flowers ground upon stones.  it often returns, in the slow rise from sleep, that undone aroma of far-off flowers, of barns and of sun. no man can know the subtle caress of that sour memory. no man can see, beyond that sprawled body, that childhood passed in such clumsy anxiety.  
NEW POEM
 even after darkness closed her eyes my mother could crochet. her hands would walk the rows of wool turning, bending, to a woolen music.  the dye lots were registered in memory: appleskin, chocolate, porcelain pan, the stitches remembered like faded rhymes: pineapple, sunflower, window pane, shell.  tied to our lives those past years by merely a soft colored yarn, she’d sit for hours, her dark lips moving as if reciting prayers, coaching the sighted hands.  
NEW POEM
 so beautiful but often unseen a maid of nature the street cleaner that’s everywhere never thanked never liked always ignored so elegant in a way no one sees but without it we would be in trash up to our knees with the heart of a lion the mind of a fox the color of the night sky a crow the unpaid workman that helps in every way each and every day  
NEW POEM
 katherine, katherine, katherine, katherine. black hair, small cold eyes, whom you loved. cock-tease katherine, chewer of souls. the door blew open and she blew in, a ghoul. black air, small cold wind, taking everything. fish-eater katherine, whose nails dig blood. i’m going to call her pinch-cunt, pickle-lip, piss-dribble, shit-smear, goat’s-meat breath. i want to throw stones at her mother’s corpse, send her children to name-change foster homes. may the coat she is wearing burst into flames and boil the flesh blistering off her bones. may she be refused in both heaven and hell and wander the earth forever without rest— a hungry ghost clinging to the rocks and trees.  
NEW POEM
 she pays attention to the hair, not her fingers, and cuts herself once or twice a day.   doesn’t notice anymore, just if the blood starts flowing.   says, excuse me, to the customer and walks away for a band-aid.   same spot on the middle finger over and over, raised like a callus.   also the nicks where she snips between her fingers, the torn webbing.   also spider veins on her legs now, so ugly, though she sits in a chair for half of each cut, rolls around from side to side.   at night in the winter she sleeps in white cotton gloves, neosporin on the cuts, vitamin e, then heavy lotion.   all night, for weeks, her white hands lie clothed like those of a young girl going to her first party.   sleeping alone, she opens and closes her long scissors and the hair falls under her hands.   it’s a good living, kind of like an undertaker, the people keep coming, and the hair, shoulder length, french twist, braids.   someone has to cut it.   at the end she whisks and talcums my neck.   only then can i bend and see my hair, how it covers the floor, curls and clippings of brown and silver, how it shines like a field of scythed hay beneath my feet.  
NEW POEM
 as gestures to beckon geometry's end i post letters to my lost mayan sisters, solicit layers sussed from layers to test history, push past parallel. mystery becomes you, mother, as does the lust the rest of us suffer, lust you must once have induced. what perceptions i trust defy perspective. i take my troubles scribbled, not erased.

 o my dark rosaleen, do not sigh, do not weep! the priests are on the ocean green, they march along the deep. there’s wine from the royal pope, upon the ocean green; and spanish ale shall give you hope, my dark rosaleen! my own rosaleen!  shall glad your heart, shall give you hope, shall give you health, and help, and hope, my dark rosaleen!  over hills, and thro’ dales, have i roam’d for your sake; all yesterday i sail’d with sails on river and on lake. the erne, at its highest flood, i dash’d across unseen, for there was lightning in my blood, my dark rosaleen!  my own rosaleen! o, there was lightning in my blood, red lighten’d thro’ my blood. my dark rosaleen!   all day long, in unrest, to and fro, do i move. the very soul within my breast is wasted for you, love! the heart in my bosom faints to think of you, my queen, my life of life, my saint of saints, my dark rosaleen! my own rosaleen! to hear your sweet and sad complaints, my life, my love, my saint of saints, my dark rosaleen! woe and pain, pain and woe, are my lot, night and noon, to see your bright face clouded so, like to the mournful moon. but yet will i rear your throne again in golden sheen;  ‘tis you shall reign, shall reign alone, my dark rosaleen! my own rosaleen! ‘tis you shall have the golden throne, ‘tis you shall reign, and reign alone, my dark rosaleen!  over dews, over sands, will i fly, for your weal: your holy delicate white hands shall girdle me with steel. at home, in your emerald bowers, from morning’s dawn till e’en, you’ll pray for me, my flower of flowers, my dark rosaleen! my fond rosaleen! you’ll think of me through daylight hours my virgin flower, my flower of flowers, my dark rosaleen!  i could scale the blue air, i could plough the high hills, oh, i could kneel all night in prayer, to heal your many ills! and one beamy smile from you would float like light between my toils and me, my own, my true, my dark rosaleen! my fond rosaleen! would give me life and soul anew, my dark rosaleen!  o, the erne shall run red, with redundance of blood, the earth shall rock beneath our tread, and flames wrap hill and wood,  and gun-peal and slogan-cry wake many a glen serene, ere you shall fade, ere you shall die, my dark rosaleen! my own rosaleen! the judgement hour must first be nigh, ere you can fade, ere you can die, my dark rosaleen!  
NEW POEM
 a daughter is not a passing cloud, but permanent, holding earth and sky together with her shadow. she sleeps upstairs like mystery in a story, blowing leaves down the stairs, then cold air, then warm. we who at sixty should know everything, know nothing. we become dull and disoriented by uncertain weather. we kneel, palms together, before this blossoming altar.  
NEW POEM
 there is an old statue in the courtyard that weeps, like niobe, its sorrow in stone. the griefs of the ages she has made her own. her eyes are rain-washed but not hard, her body is covered in mould, the garden overgrown.  one by one the first lights come on, those that haven’t been on all night. christmas, the harshly festive, has come and gone. no snow, but the rain pours down in the first hour before dawn, before daylight.  swift’s home for ‘fools and mad’ has become the administrative block. much there has remained unchanged for many a long year — stairs, chairs, georgian widows shafting light and dust, of the satirist;  but the real hospital is a cheerful modern extension at the back hung with restful reproductions of dufy, klee and braque. television, russian fiction, snooker with the staff, a sifter of lucozade, a paragraph of newsweek or the daily mail  are my daily routine during the festive season. they don’t lock the razors here as in bowditch hall. we have remained upright — though, to be frank, the christmas dinner scene, with grown men in their festive gear, was a sobering sight.  i watch the last planes of the year go past, silently climbing a cloud-lit sky. earth-bound, soon i’ll be taking a train to cork and trying to get back to work at my sea-lit, fort-view desk in the turf-smoky dusk.  meanwhile, next door, a visiting priest intones to a faithful dormitory. i sit on my protestant bed, a make-believe existentialist, and stare the clouds of unknowing. we style, as best we may, our private destiny; or so it seems to me  as i chew my thumb and try to figure out what brought me to my present state — an ‘educated man’, a man of consequence, no bum but one who has hardly grasped what life is about, if anything. my children, far away, don’t know where i am today, in a dublin asylum with a paper whistle and a mince pie, my bits and pieces making a home from home. i pray to the rain-clouds that they never come where their lost father lies; that their mother thrives; and that i may measure up to them before i die.  soon a new year will be here demanding, as before, modest proposals, resolute resolutions, a new leaf, new leaves. this is the story of my life, the story of all lives everywhere, mad fools whatever we are, in here or out there.  light and sane i shall walk down to the train, into that world whose sanity we know, like swift to be a fiction and a show. the clouds part, the rain ceases, the sun casts now upon everyone its ancient shadow.  
NEW POEM
 when you wake up after twelve hours the stove is cold, there's ice in the water bucket — clouds outside and snow, the noise of a crow, the only sound; until your wife cries from an upper bunk, honey, i'd like some coffee. luther chuckles. i nod, excuse myself  for the men's room  next to me stretches a teacher who once warned me not to get married too early. elderly now, but having done well in real estate as a second career. he says well, well, as if  he can't recall my name. but buys me a drink and talks of  his wayward daughter. when he mentions her married last name i tell him i have met her, but leave off at that    . . . he squints like a badger. in my wife's family, he resumes, after a jostling by a drunken salesman, there's a sort of stupid gene that runs through the whole outfit, being half  finnish, half  dutch — or maybe something cancelled something    . . .    i notice a protuberance, a small growth at the edge of  his eye, hanging like a broken thread  i always thought, i say, your daughter had a charming personality. he hunches his shoulders. waking to dread, the debts of  dread — but i couldn't help him. neither did i want to. on the way out i spot my first wife chatting with a small-time gangster — she flutters a wave my way, a victorian flutter  
NEW POEM
 still half drunk, after a night at cards, with the grey dawn taking us unaware among our guilty kings and queens, we drove far north in the morning, winners, losers, to a stream in the high hills, to climb up to a place one of us knew, with some vague view of cutting losses or consolidating gains by the old standard appeal to the wilderness, the desert, the empty places of our exile, bringing only the biblical bread and cheese and cigarettes got from a grocer’s on the way, expecting to drink only the clear cold water among the stones, and remember, or forget. though no one said anything about atonement, there was still some purgatorial idea in all those aching heads and ageing hearts as we climbed the giant stair of the stream, reaching the place around noon.  it was as promised, a wonder, with granite walls enclosing ledges, long and flat, of limestone, or, rolling, of lava; within the ledges the water, fast and still, pouring its yellow light, and green, over the tilted slabs of the floor, blackened at shady corners, falling in a foam of crystal to a calm where the waterlight dappled the ledges as they leaned against the sun; big blue dragonflies hovered and darted and dipped a wing, hovered again against the low wind moving over the stream, and shook the flakes of light from their clear wings. this surely was it, was what we had come for, was nature, though it looked like art with its grey fortress walls and laminated benches as in the waiting room of some petrified station. but we believed; and what it was we believed made of the place a paradise for ruined poker players, win or lose, who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks like gasping trout (the water they drank making them drunk again), lit cigarettes and lay back waiting for nature to say the last word —as though the stones were memnon stones, which, caught in a certain light, would sing.  the silence (and even the noise of the waters was silence) grew pregnant; that is the phrase, grew pregnant; but nothing else did. the mountains brought forth not a mouse, and the rocks, unlike the ones you would expect to find on the slopes of purgatory or near helicon, mollified by muses and with a little give to ’em, were modern american rocks, and hard as rocks. our easy bones groaned, our flesh baked on one side and shuddered on the other; and each man thought bitterly about primitive simplicity and decadence, and how he had been ruined by civilization and forced by circumstances to drink and smoke and sit up all night inspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards until he was broken-winded as a trout on a rock and had no use for the doctrines of jean jacques rousseau, and could no longer afford a savagery whether noble or not; some would never batter that battered copy of walden again.  but all the same, the water, the sunlight, and the wind did something; even the dragonflies did something to the minds full of telephone numbers and flushes, to the flesh sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other. and the rocks, the old and tumbling boulders which formed the giant stair of the stream, induced (again) some purgatorial ideas concerning humility, concerning patience and enduring what had to be endured, winning and losing and breaking even; ideas of weathering in whatever weather, being eroded, or broken, or ground down into pebbles by the stream’s necessitous and grave currents. but to these ideas did any purgatory respond? only this one: that in a world where even the memnon stones were carved in soap one might at any rate wash with the soap.  after a time we talked about the war, about what we had done in the war, and how near some of us had been to being drowned, and burned, and shot, and how many people we knew who had been drowned, or burned, or shot; and would it have been better to have died in the war, the peaceful old war, where we were young? but the mineral peace, or paralysis, of those great stones, the moving stillness of the waters, entered our speech; the ribs and blood of the earth, from which all fables grow, established poetry and truth in us, so that at last one said, “i shall play cards until the day i die,” and another said, “in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins and minerals needed to sustain man’s life,” and still another, “i shall live on smoke until my spirit has been cured of flesh.”  climbing downstream again, on the way home to the lives we had left empty for a day, we noticed, as not before, how of three bridges not one had held the stream, which in its floods had twisted the girders, splintered the boards, hurled boulder on boulder, and had broken into rubble, smashed practically back to nature, the massive masonry of span after span with its indifferent rage; this was a sight that sobered us considerably, and kept us quiet both during the long drive home and after, till it was time to deal the cards.  
NEW POEM
 what was the future then but affirmation, the first yes between us followed by the first lingering dawn? waking below a window shaded by redwoods (waking? we hadn’t slept—), we found time saved, like sunlight in a tree.  still, the house was cold, and there were shadows. the couple in the next room rapped the wall to quiet us, like them, condescending from a bitter knowledge that, young as we all were, love didn’t last, but receded into silence.  wedging our pillows back of the headboard that clapped in time with us, we let them think we agreed. then, holding on, we closed each other’s mouths and felt that slowness that the best days begin with turn into the speed with which they fly.  flight was that year’s theme, all around us— flight of hunter and hunted, the president turning inward on one wing, and, on the patio, the emigration of termites, a glittering fleet, leaving that shadowed house a little lighter.  within it all, above it, or beyond, we thought we were the fixed point, and held still as the quail lit down beside us and waited for her plump mate to appear, his crest a quivering hook. the valley’s reach of sunshine reeled them in.  there was wilderness around us, don’t forget. behind the nets of fragrance thrown across our path by the acacia lurked the green man or the kidnapper. and there was the pacific with its own passions taking place as rain.  the sorrow of the couple in the next room was a deep muteness nightly. that loneliness could come of loving was like news of time cored out of the redwood. the house that we made shake, or thought we did, was taking wing already.  after we left, still it took us years before we stopped comparing every morning together to that first one and every place we lived to that first place and everything we said to that first word repeated all night long.

 what will be served for our reception in the devastation? finger food, of course and white wine, something printed on the napkins.  we were not children together but we are now. every bird knows only two notes constantly rearranged.  that’s called forever so we wear pajamas to the practice funeral, buckeroos to the end. we make paper hats of headlines and float them away.  my home made of smoke, tiny spider made of punctuation, my favorite poem is cinder scratched into a sidewalk.  my friend’s becoming the simplest man, he sees a lesson in everything, in missing his train, in his son hollering from the ﬁrst branch, dad, guess where i am.  i was with him for my ﬁrst magpies, governmental and acting like hell. and the new nickel with washington hard to recognize.  we’d driven by a rabbit flattened by an upset truck, jars of miracle whip broken over the toll road in heavy snow.  we watched an old lady eat a hot dog in a bun with a knife and fork.  a few emeralds winged off a fruit leaf.  what happens when your head splits open and the bird flies out, its two notes deranged? you got better, i got better, wildflowers rimmed the crater, glitter glitter glitter.  we knew someone whose father died then we knew ourselves. astronomer, gladiator, thief, a tombstone salesman.  all our vacations went to the sea that breathed two times a day without a machine. we got in trouble with a raft doing what we promised not to.  further out to be brought further back.  there’s my friend in his squashed hat trying to determine if a dot is a living thing and do no harm.  he’s having trouble remembering street names but there’s still plenty of thoreau.  all that a human is made of is gold, very very little gold.

 korea might be gay but i do not think you are. korea is a peninsula. you and i are people meaning that we have hair we comb and things to look at. our lips pout and take on the fullness of an adopted meaning.  the fact of the matter is that relentlessness is a hand- shake, a limp fish or glass of lukewarm tea. the fact of the matter is that standing on a stage everything is comic, meaning small and memorable, of the insubstan- tial "universe," a minor disaster or floating chord.  the darkness is outside when i see you, not in.  i laugh when the funny thing gets said, and mostly i laugh inside. on the inside is without curves and artifi- cial spaces, many of them not gay or korea. but when i see you they all run and speech is maybe stammer, sometimes slur.  margaret cho, your tongue might wreak more havoc than in speaks, outside being from the vantage point of escalating stairs, from dark glasses and escapades. the vantage being from a great height, a lighter space on the inside that was formerly before the dark and laugh. we really wait for the funny things before they are said and let go for ever after.  margaret, there are many funny sisters and there are many porn stores. i too think woo lae ok is really petri- fied of its own fish. that there are babies and there are  dykes, that this little piggy has something, that a pubic mound transforms into a public space, not being gay or with outstanding curves, prayerful and abashed, facing the tide, grown over, rediscovered in the woods by strangers and haunted for years and years.

 for my mother and father apparently i’m mom’s immaculately-conceived irish-american son, because, social-security time come, my cherokee dad could not prove he’d been born.  he could pay taxes, though, financing troops, who’d conquered our land, and could go to jail, the time he had to shoot or die, by a caucasian attacker’s knife.  eluding recreational killers’ calendar’s enforcers, while hunting my family’s food, i thought what the hunted think, so that i ate, not only meat but the days of wild animals fed by the days of seeds, themselves eating earth’s aeons of lives, fed by the sun, rising and falling, as quail, hurtling through sky,  fell, from gun-powder, come— as the first americans came— from asia.  explosions in cannon, i have an english name, a german-chilean-american wife and could live a white life, but, with this hand, with which i write, i dug, my sixteenth summer, a winter’s supply of yams out of hard, battlefield clay, dug for my father’s mother, who— abandoned by her husband—raised, alone, a mixed-blood family and raised—her tongue spading air— ancestors, a winter’s supply or more.

 he called it “his ranch,” yet each winter day found her beside him feeding hay to hungry cows.  in summer heat you would find her in the hayfield— cutting, raking, baling, stacking.  in between she kept the books, cooked, cleaned laundered, fed bum lambs.  garden rows straight, canned jars of food lined cellar walls.  then she died. i asked him how he would manage. “just like i always have,” he said.  
NEW POEM
 it seemed those rose-pink dishes she kept for special company were always cold, brought down from the shelf in jingling stacks, the plates like the panes of ice she broke from the water bucket winter mornings, the flaring cups like tulips that opened too early and got bitten by frost. they chilled the coffee no matter how quickly you drank, while a heavy everyday mug would have kept a splash hot for the better part of a conversation. it was hard to hold up your end of the gossip with your coffee cold, but it was a special occasion, just the same, to sit at her kitchen table and sip the bitter percolation of the past week’s rumors from cups it had taken a year to collect at the grocery, with one piece free for each five pounds of flour.  
NEW POEM
 farewell (sweet cooke-ham) where i first obtained grace from that grace where perfect grace remained; and where the muses gave their full consent, i should have power the virtuous to content; where princely palace willed me to indite, the sacred story of the soul’s delight. farewell (sweet place) where virtue then did rest, and all delights did harbor in her breast; never shall my sad eyes again behold those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold. yet you (great lady) mistress of that place, from whose desires did spring this work of grace; vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past, as fleeting worldly joys that could not last, or, as dim shadows of celestial pleasures, which are desired above all earthly treasures. oh how (methought) against you thither came, each part did seem some new delight to frame! the house received all ornaments to grace it, and would endure no foulness to deface it. and walks put on their summer liveries, and all things else did hold like similes. the trees with leaves, with fruits, with flowers clad, embraced each other, seeming to be glad, turning themselves to beauteous canopies, to shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes; the crystal streams with silver spangles graced, while by the glorious sun they were embraced; the little birds in chirping notes did sing, to entertain both you and that sweet spring. and philomela with her sundry lays, both you and that delightful place did praise. oh how me thought each plant, each flower, each tree set forth their beauties then to welcome thee! the very hills right humbly did descend, when you to tread on them did intend. and as you set your feet, they still did rise, glad that they could receive so rich a prize. the gentle winds did take delight to be among those woods that were so graced by thee, and in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound, that pleasure in that place might more abound. the swelling banks delivered all their pride when such a phoenix once they had espied. each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree, thought themselves honored in supporting thee; the pretty birds would oft come to attend thee, yet fly away for fear they should offend thee; the little creatures in the burrough by would come abroad to sport them in your eye, yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand. would run away when you did make a stand. now let me come unto that stately tree, wherein such goodly prospects you did see; that oak that did in height his fellows pass, as much as lofty trees, low growing grass, much like a comely cedar straight and tall, whose beauteous stature far exceeded all. how often did you visit this fair tree, which seeming joyful in receiving thee, would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad, desirous that you there should make abode; whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil, defended phoebus when he would assail; whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air, joying his happiness when you were there. where being seated, you might plainly see hills, vales, and woods, as if on bended knee they had appeared, your honor to salute, or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit; all interlaced with brooks and crystal springs, a prospect fit to please the eyes of kings. and thirteen shires appeared all in your sight, europe could not afford much more delight. what was there then but gave you all content, while you the time in meditation spent of their creator’s power, which there you saw, in all his creatures held a perfect law; and in their beauties did you plain descry his beauty, wisdom, grace, love, majesty. in these sweet woods how often did you walk, with christ and his apostles there to talk; placing his holy writ in some fair tree to meditate what you therein did see. with moses you did mount his holy hill to know his pleasure, and perform his will. with lowly david you did often sing his holy hymns to heaven’s eternal king. and in sweet music did your soul delight to sound his praises, morning, noon, and night. with blessed joseph you did often feed your pined brethren, when they stood in need. and that sweet lady sprung from clifford’s race, of noble bedford’s blood, fair stem of grace, to honorable dorset now espoused, in whose fair breast true virtue then was housed, oh what delight did my weak spirits find in those pure parts of her well framèd mind. and yet it grieves me that i cannot be near unto her, whose virtues did agree with those fair ornaments of outward beauty, which did enforce from all both love and duty. unconstant fortune, thou art most to blame, who casts us down into so low a frame where our great friends we cannot daily see, so great a difference is there in degree. many are placed in those orbs of state, partners in honor, so ordained by fate, nearer in show, yet farther off in love, in which, the lowest always are above. but whither am i carried in conceit, my wit too weak to conster of the great. why not? although we are but born of earth, we may behold the heavens, despising death; and loving heaven that is so far above, may in the end vouchsafe us entire love. therefore sweet memory do thou retain those pleasures past, which will not turn again: remember beauteous dorset’s former sports, so far from being touched by ill reports, wherein myself did always bear a part, while reverend love presented my true heart. those recreations let me bear in mind, which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find, whereof deprived, i evermore must grieve, hating blind fortune, careless to relieve, and you sweet cooke-ham, whom these ladies leave, i now must tell the grief you did conceive at their departure, when they went away, how everything retained a sad dismay. nay long before, when once an inkling came, methought each thing did unto sorrow frame: the trees that were so glorious in our view, forsook both flowers and fruit, when once they knew of your depart, their very leaves did wither, changing their colors as they grew together. but when they saw this had no power to stay you, they often wept, though, speechless, could not pray you, letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall, as if they said, why will ye leave us all? this being vain, they cast their leaves away hoping that pity would have made you stay: their frozen tops, like age’s hoary hairs, shows their disasters, languishing in fears. a swarthy riveled rind all over spread, their dying bodies half alive, half dead. but your occasions called you so away that nothing there had power to make you stay. yet did i see a noble grateful mind requiting each according to their kind, forgetting not to turn and take your leave of these sad creatures, powerless to receive your favor, when with grief you did depart, placing their former pleasures in your heart, giving great charge to noble memory there to preserve their love continually. but specially the love of that fair tree, that first and last you did vouchsafe to see, in which it pleased you oft to take the air with noble dorset, then a virgin fair, where many a learned book was read and scanned, to this fair tree, taking me by the hand, you did repeat the pleasures which had passed, seeming to grieve they could no longer last. and with a chaste, yet loving kiss took leave, of which sweet kiss i did it soon bereave, scorning a senseless creature should possess so rare a favor, so great happiness. no other kiss it could receive from me, for fear to give back what it took of thee, so i ungrateful creature did deceive it of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it. and though it oft had given me much content, yet this great wrong i never could repent; but of the happiest made it most forlorn, to show that nothing’s free from fortune’s scorne, while all the rest with this most beauteous tree made their sad consort sorrow’s harmony. the flowers that on the banks and walks did grow, crept in the ground, the grass did weep for woe. the winds and waters seemed to chide together because you went away they knew not whither; and those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear, with grief and trouble wrinkled did appear. those pretty birds that wonted were to sing, now neither sing, nor chirp, nor use their wing, but with their tender feet on some bare spray, warble forth sorrow, and their own dismay. fair philomela leaves her mournful ditty, drowned in deep sleep, yet can procure no pity. each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree looks bare and desolate now for want of thee, turning green tresses into frosty gray, while in cold grief they wither all away. the sun grew weak, his beams no comfort gave, while all green things did make the earth their grave. each brier, each bramble, when you went away caught fast your clothes, thinking to make you stay; delightful echo wonted to reply to our last words, did now for sorrow die; the house cast off each garment that might grace it, putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it. all desolation then there did appear, when you were going whom they held so dear. this last farewell to cooke-ham here i give, when i am dead thy name in this may live, wherein i have performed her noble hest whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast, and ever shall, so long as life remains, tying my life to her by those rich chains.

 heart, oh heart, i sit here writing your name on pieces of paper, folded, hidden, misplaced . . . found again.  there is the element of saying and there is the element of making: one needn’t choose. i am singing the dream out from the ice, asking it to carry me like a horse or a river, down and away.  this day, here in paned-glass sun: the young waitress shaking out her apron and retying it flat across her stomach— a bit of vanity—her hair swept off her neck, crash of a milk bottle on the granite counter, cream spread in a mild pool toward the rim, and the roots of habit and longing briefly seized by the mind.  so noisy here! the sound echoes out of years, brought to this showing forth, unrehearsed. it seems we wake and find ourselves repeating, embodying the ancient gestures by which we recognize ourselves completed.  not one of us could be born and invent life—it must show through us— the arm flung in the air, the coffee poured out, and down the street, someone hurrying by, head down against the wind.  and a man and a woman come to an old grief, carved in them, carved into them —the old way of water wearing rock— by law, and the hatred between them is equal to the hope neither will release.  each wants to be whole, to embody all of time, when nothing in this world is whole, and this is by law.  when my father said bitterly to my mother:you have changed, he meant, without meaning to say, how she had changed him. a man holds his head down against the wind. yet the wind fills him with the dust of temples, the breath of the dead.  the dream of the light inside the branches— a gleam of wet, glimmer that is a bud, the leaf within the bud.  the photographer comes inside and closes the lens of his camera. then he is the lens. then my eye is the light. this is the element of saying. the young waitress flings a paper cup behind her, into the trash can. that is a saying. the cream swirled into the coffee, the sugar dissolving, disembodied, and the body of the manager disappears, swallowed into a doorway.  the element of making is slow, uncertain as a temple, a falling forward, stitching back, like a stone wall, like the panes in an arched window, like a repetition chosen beyond necessity.  yet somehow we have seen all this before— the girl in the fur hat speaking syrup into a phone; the falseness of her charm is an ancient imposter, familiar and therefore true. a door is opened and falls closed. suddenly at every table someone looks down and is reading— books, newspapers, calendars, reading tea leaves, reading bones.  a woman in a periwinkle jacket: i am reading her shoulders as the day introspects. in dream the passive construction and the past perfect tense prevail: she was being pushed on a swing. the woman with many television credits gazes out the window, heavy with years, forgetting herself, forgetting sorrow, the false husband, the crippled child, the old plots forgetting,  and it is suddenly lovely, as free as something read or dreamed; the young waitress with sun on her face—her unblemished face—looks up, from the middle of eternity, her desire immaculate in the moment.  when a word is beautiful above all others—your name— when a woman appears as a bird of prey and we turn away, hoping not to be recognized—oh heart!—  when the light on the branches flares in a window with no sky, this is old story reading us, these are springs from words laid down before and ahead of us, and in the moment we are making an answer.

 we could hear her knocking down strands of cobweb from ceilings—sticky filaments, sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings to a worm of discontent. it lodged beneath the heart, rubbed our frayed nerves, gnawed at the gut, spleen, ovaries. filth  was mom's first enemy, so each day began with ritual cleaning: the stab and sweep of the broom down the dark hall, over the stained and scratched oak floors.  for weeks, she held her dust mop one-handed, and with the other cupped a hernia, while she swore at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins and failures: sloth, stupidity, secrecy.  we watched her smash the spiders that ran, herky-jerky, along the baseboards, while we ran, too.  glaring at each other, we gathered up the scattered laundry, our father’s shoes, his newspapers and tools, our books, drawings, music, sweatshirts, and jackets, whatever we’d left lying around.  we were guilty, but good at evasion. we cultivated shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own: my tough older sister sneered and stalked out of the house to meet her boyfriend; my sweet younger sister trembled and cried, comforted by one of our many dogs. i slammed doors, pounded them with my fists, screamed, “shut up, shut up, shut up!” she couldn’t  leave us alone. she loved us too much.  though we were quick, she was quicker. her words stung.  we must have deserved it.

 “e to allor li prega per quell' amor the i mena, e quei verranno.” inferno v this also is a place that love is known in, this hollow land beneath a lifeless sea opposite to the place that he was born in, how far it is impossible to say. the brackish water as i crossed a bridge was delicately creased and stained and stale, like love-disordered linen.  lovers here must meet on unsure ground like strangers in a circumspect hotel which, although luxurious and grand, trembles beneath their feet like earth in hell. lifted on concentric gales scraps of paper, leaves and gulls fluttered dismally aloft and groaned.  here darkness grows and light itself decays; rain falls from time to time and night falls too upon earth’s civil centre that decoys the eternal with the promise that is now. there were no corners, every street ran on infinite and straight, there is no gate, no warning and no keys.  i hear a step approaching and refuse to look aside, a while your silhouette persists, the fire illuminates your face from under as you light a cigarette; all-knowing, arch-angelic eyes, human features cut in ice— the spark you struck at once attained the fuse.  i recognize the vanity and scorn, the fear, the greed, in short the mask of love, familiar and disdainful, and i turn about. like children sharing what they have we learned in that experiment what the spirit’s weakness meant, the nature of the torment to be borne.  what shall i give you? what will be your price? your body’s mine, the rich, fantastic horde of your embracements—angels live on praise, take it, it is all i can afford. outside a centrifugal wind sustained a freight of souls that whined and wept along the terrible canals.  and when i close my eyes i see a ship at anchor in the water of a bay. i cling to that imaginary shape capable of taking me away to i do not know what ports. perhaps tomorrow it departs, anonymous, invulnerable, free.

 the sea is calm tonight. the tide is full, the moon lies fair upon the straits; on the french coast the light gleams and is gone; the cliffs of england stand, glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. come to the window, sweet is the night-air! only, from the long line of spray where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, listen! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, at their return, up the high strand, begin, and cease, and then again begin, with tremulous cadence slow, and bring the eternal note of sadness in.  sophocles long ago heard it on the ægean, and it brought into his mind the turbid ebb and flow of human misery; we find also in the sound a thought, hearing it by this distant northern sea.  the sea of faith was once, too, at the full, and round earth’s shore lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. but now i only hear its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, retreating, to the breath of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the world.  ah, love, let us be true to one another! for the world, which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams, so various, so beautiful, so new, hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; and we are here as on a darkling plain swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.  
NEW POEM
 empty cattle trailers rumbled dummy thunder down the road all day, and now tonight, heat lightning flashes more of the same fake rain. it’s just as well. i couldn’t get to sleep, and now it ricochets across the sky with empty loads of light. we’ve had a month of drought that tightens dirt around my pond. the local wells are dry. but i’ve retired, threw out my wand. i hate this time of year.  roux can burn if flour sticks in skillet butter. i’ve been cooking up a storm myself, my daddy’s filé gumbo recipe. he used to be a chef on oil rigs until the hurricane. i heard the waves that killed him, and i hear them every year. it’s emptiness that fills me. that’s my skill. i hear the vacant rain before it falls. it’s like the murmur of a spiraled shell.  hurricane weather, stewing deep for landfall, spewing rain-a-plenty in the gulf and here in tennessee they always have a lack of something. two men called today for wells. i told them both to go to hell, and now they think i’m sinful, not to use my skill. they stand to lose so much, but don’t we all. i lost a lot in hurricane camille and even now can’t hear the end of it.  more heat lightning flashes, absent rain that passes over clouds, and i can make it out, each gurgling current under withered fields, down kitchen drains. the neighbors think i’m crazy, up all hours, but they’ll never know the screaming voice inside a breaker’s rage or how it simmers in my ear. i hate the sound of water. give me one good chance to make it silent. i’d be right as rain.  
NEW POEM
 protruding, rebelling against the lips, the long, pointed, ill-fated fang stared at me, (in spite of awkward attempts to hide it).  stealing adolescent glances, i dreamed it pierced me, pushing deep in the base of my neck. i bit my lower lip, flushed, but not before blushing under its spell.  yesterday, yesterday when he smiled at me, with teeth in perfect alignment (dentistry can work miracles), i turned my apostate face, and squinting, pretended to watch passersby.  
NEW POEM
 the message i found on the post-it note went thus: love truth; expect to be found out.  kid-style capitals proved i wrote it, but left no clue why i'd swelled into a fat  clause no editor could edit; then, an entry on a shrink's list of patient slang for sex— her desk norwegian teak, the mug of tea on which she had affixed her post-it notes  hot against her knuckle, their lips of stickum loosening . . . and yet, i knew the note to peel away at hour's end would terminate our sessions—cool as the draft her linen  skirt was lifting to: love, just stay benighted,  given everything i know you've got to hide.  
NEW POEM
 dear love, for nothing less than thee would i have broke this happy dream; it was a theme for reason, much too strong for fantasy, therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet my dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it. thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice to make dreams truths, and fables histories; enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best, not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.  as lightning, or a taper's light, thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me; yet i thought thee (for thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight; but when i saw thou sawest my heart, and knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art, when thou knew'st what i dreamt, when thou knew'st when excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then, i must confess, it could not choose but be profane, to think thee any thing but thee.  coming and staying show'd thee, thee, but rising makes me doubt, that now thou art not thou. that love is weak where fear's as strong as he; 'tis not all spirit, pure and brave, if mixture it of fear, shame, honour have; perchance as torches, which must ready be, men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me; thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then i will dream that hope again, but else would die.  
NEW POEM
 i can enter the morning with traces of an eternal dream: to live on a planet of women. we sing in the fertile forest, caress on lavender hills, bathe beneath cascades of clear waters. and just like that, nude and wet, we mount each other’s bodies. our desire is a whale that searches for calm in the depth of the sea.  i smell sex in my hair when i awaken.  the dream perfumes all of my days. i go to the post office and look for stamps with etchings of flowers and fruits so that i can send letters to the women who loved me in my sleep.  we are in a world that is not ours. what do we do with the dreams that touch our consciousness in the nude each night?  our planet of women is nothing more than a dream. who knows how many of us bathe in the woods or which ones of us have wings that let us fly with our flesh? it’s not for anyone to know. fortunately, we always dream paradise, we make it ours. there, we find each other and live in our collective memory.  and so, i smell sex in my hair when i awaken.  
NEW POEM
 i i wandered through a house of many rooms. it grew darker and darker, until, at last, i could only find my way by passing my fingers along the wall. suddenly my hand shot through an open window, and the thorn of a rose i could not see pricked it so sharply that i cried aloud.  ii i dug a grave under an oak-tree. with infinite care, i stamped my spade into the heavy grass. the sod sucked it, and i drew it out with effort, watching the steel run liquid in the moonlight as it came clear. i stooped, and dug, and never turned, for behind me, on the dried leaves, my own face lay like a white pebble, waiting.  iii i gambled with a silver money. the dried seed-vessels of “honesty” were stacked in front of me. dry, white years slipping through my fingers one by one. one by one, gathered by the croupier. “faites vos jeux, messieurs.” i staked on the red, and the black won. dry years, dead years; but i had a system, i always staked on the red.  iv i painted the leaves of bushes red and shouted: “fire! fire!” but the neighbors only laughed. “we cannot warm our hands at them,” they said. then they cut down my bushes, and made a bonfire, and danced about it. but i covered my face and wept, for ashes are not beautiful even in the dawn.  v i followed a procession of singing girls who danced to the glitter of tambourines. where the street turned at a lighted corner, i caught the purple dress of one of the dancers, but, as i grasped it, it tore, and the purple dye ran from it like blood upon the ground.  vi i wished to post a letter, but although i paid much, still the letter was overweight. “what is in this package?” said the clerk, “it is very heavy.” “yes,” i said, “and yet it is only a dried fruit.”  vii i had made a kite, on it i had pasted golden stars and white torches, and the tail was spotted scarlet like a tiger-lily, and very long. i flew my kite, and my soul was contented watching it flash against the concave of the sky. my friends pointed at the clouds; they begged me to take in my kite. but i was happy seeing the mirror shock of it against the black clouds. then the lightning came and struck the kite. it puffed—blazed—fell. but still i walked on, in the drowning rain, slowly winding up the string.  
NEW POEM
 art was long. paul was short. art sang the song. paul was the sort  who made one up as if from air. paul had more gift. art had more hair—  which isn’t to take away from arts. many sing well if someone starts,  and it robs no simon to get paid like paul. along was art’s way to be singing at all.  if paul robbed some, it’s harder revealing. what stuck in his mind, he stuck to concealing  so koo-koo-ka-choo would stick in our heads. it wasn’t garfunkel, someone said simon said  when they parted acts. debts one forgets. acoustic is fraught with strings over frets,  taken together, taken apart. paul lifting from life. life lifting from art.

 als das kind kind war, war es die zeit der folgenden fragen: warum bin ich ich und warum nicht du? — peter handke, “lied vom kindsein” i   began like pu, the uncarved block in a strange land. simulacrum, wood golem knocking about, dreaming of flesh. lies, truths, growths, recede and wonder what it is to be:  d’où venons nous  que sommes nous  où allons nous   woher kommen wir  wer sind wir  wohin gehen wir   where do we come from?  what are we?  where are we going?   how long have i got?   father never answers. why he is surprised when i bolt, a prodigal arrow, into the world, i can only suspect, among gears and puppets.   ii   wander the world.  i saw a boy herding ox.  i saw a dog dropping bones in the water, barking for more. i saw a bathing woman with a beggar on a crutch of wood.  i saw a wretch with a dead albatross envy archers whose arrows were beyond them.  i may have seen a fleeting vanity fair, some carnival of souls. i saw a hmong orphan calling naga kings from the riverbank, expecting nothing.   iii   maw like leviathan, peer of melville’s albino, abyssal gaze returned. within your belly like a worm, after a lifetime of fighting, how  i’ve become like you, adrift  in the sea, jonah, a leaf, while the boy next to me has become a jackass. and yet i still wish and yearn, dionysian, a destiny, if not a dynasty.

 el patio de mi casa, 1990, by maría brito my patio was once a schoolyard, or maybe a barracoon, perhaps both, &amp; the ghosts of children nest under the pink sink, mouths agape for flakes of rust, or they creep to the ceiling, sucking on the five taps of blue water, their little lips abuzz like cicadas. in the moonlight i see them bounce on my feather bed, bowed like an old donkey’s back, or they teeter-totter in my wicker chair darned with burlap string. leave them alone, i say to my mother, who wants to cleanse the house with carvacrol, trapping these children’s souls in beehives, then stringing them up with kites so they fly to the moon. let them drum our dented pots, let them screech happy carols, let them dance with tin spurs on their little feet. mother, i don’t care if they nibble our family photos, soil your heirlooms of lace, or steal what few grains of rice (more like gypsum ants) you hoard in the pink pantry. let them play cat’s cradle with spiderwebs, let them rummage in your armoire of moths, let them lurk in your shadows of ill will &amp; tease you to laughter. ghosts are unruly, free to be fickle, unlike me, the pig-tailed girl you kept strapped to the sewing machine in the shed of planks by the mango tree too old to fruit. work &amp; sweat will set you free, you said, just like fidel on the radio. cut me out of those sepia photos on the wall, burn those baby braids you keep in porcelain, toss my first communion gown into the sea. i wish i’d been born into a brood of mice, quick to grow, quick to breed, quick to die among the kapok trees.

 if you are not to become a monster, you must care what they think. if you care what they think,  how will you not hate them, and so become a monster of the opposite kind? from where then  is love to come—love for your enemy that is the way of liberty? from forgiveness. forgiven, they go  free of you, and you of them; they are to you as sunlight on a green branch. you must not  think of them again, except as monsters like yourself, pitiable because unforgiving.

 london returns in damp, fragmented flurries when i should be doing something else. a scrap of song, a pink scarf, and i’m back to curries and pub food, long, wet walks without a map, bouts of bronchitis, a case of the flu, my halfhearted studies, and brooding thoughts and scanning faces in every bar for you. those months come down to moments or small plots, like the bum on the tube, enraged that no one spoke, who raved and spat, the whole car thick with dread, only to ask, won’t someone tell a joke? and this mouse of a woman offered,what’s big and red and sits in the corner? a naughty bus.

 falling to sleep last night in a deep crevasse between one rough dream and another, i seemed, still awake, to be stranded on a stony path, and there the familiar enigma presented itself in the shape of a little trembling lamb. it was lying like a pearl in the trough between one welsh slab and another, and it was crying.  i looked around, as anyone would, for its mother. nothing was there. what did i know about lambs? should i pick it up? carry it . . . where? what would i do if it were dying? the hand of my conscience fought with the claw of my fear. it wasn't so easy to imitate the good shepherd in that faded, framed sunday school picture filtering now through the dream's daguerreotype.  with the wind fallen and the moon swollen to the full, small, white doubles of the creature at my feet flared like candles in the creases of the night until it looked to be alive with newborn lambs. where could they all have come from? a second look, and the bleating lambs were birds— kittiwakes nesting, clustered on a cliff face, fixing on me their dark accusing eyes.  there was a kind of imperative not to touch them, yet to be of them, whatever they were— now lambs, now birds, now floating points of light— fireflies signaling how many lost new england summers? one form, now another; one configuration, now another. like fossils locked deep in the folds of my brain, outliving a time by telling its story. like stars.  
NEW POEM
 in the portrait of jefferson that hangs at monticello, he is rendered two-toned: his forehead white with illumination —  a lit bulb — the rest of his face in shadow, darkened as if the artist meant to contrast his bright knowledge, its dark subtext.  by 1805, when jefferson sat for the portrait, he was already linked to an affair with his slave. against a backdrop, blue  and ethereal, a wash of paint that seems to hold him in relief, jefferson gazes out across the centuries, his lips fixed as if  he's just uttered some final word. the first time i saw the painting, i listened as my father explained the contradictions:  how jefferson hated slavery, though —out of necessity, my father said — had to own slaves; that his moral philosophy meant  he could not have fathered those children: would have been impossible, my father said. for years we debated the distance between  word and deed. i'd follow my father from book to book, gathering citations, listening as he named — like a field guide to virginia —  each flower and tree and bird as if to prove a man's pursuit of knowledge is greater than his shortcomings, the limits of his vision.  i did not know then the subtext of our story, that my father could imagine jefferson's words made flesh in my flesh —  the improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the whites

 go, dumb-born book, tell her that sang me once that song of lawes: hadst thou but song as thou hast subjects known, then were there cause in thee that should condone even my faults that heavy upon me lie and build her glories their longevity.  tell her that sheds such treasure in the air, recking naught else but that her graces give life to the moment, i would bid them live as roses might, in magic amber laid, red overwrought with orange and all made one substance and one colour braving time.  tell her that goes with song upon her lips but sings not out the song, nor knows the maker of it, some other mouth, may be as fair as hers, might, in new ages, gain her worshippers, when our two dusts with waller’s shall be laid, siftings on siftings in oblivion, till change hath broken down all things save beauty alone.

 i have seen the brown recluse spider run with a net in her hand, or rather, what resembled a net, what resembled a hand. she ran down the gleaming white floor of the bathtub, trailing a frail swirl of hair, and in it the hull of a beetle lay woven. the hair was my wife’s, long and dark, a few loose strands, a curl she might idly have turned on a finger, she might idly have twisted, speaking to me, and the legs of the beetle were broken.

 nothing so true as what you once let fall, "most women have no characters at all." matter too soft a lasting mark to bear, and best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair.  how many pictures of one nymph we view, all how unlike each other, all how true! arcadia's countess, here, in ermin'd pride, is, there, pastora by a fountain side. here fannia, leering on her own good man, and there, a naked leda with a swan. let then the fair one beautifully cry, in magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye, or dress'd in smiles of sweet cecilia shine, with simp'ring angels, palms, and harps divine; whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it, if folly grows romantic, i must paint it.  come then, the colours and the ground prepare! dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air; choose a firm cloud, before it fall, and in it catch, ere she change, the cynthia of this minute.  rufa, whose eye quick-glancing o'er the park, attracts each light gay meteor of a spark, agrees as ill with rufa studying locke, as sappho's diamonds with her dirty smock; or sappho at her toilet's greasy task, with sappho fragrant at an ev'ning masque: so morning insects that in muck begun, shine, buzz, and flyblow in the setting sun.  how soft is silia! fearful to offend; the frail one's advocate, the weak one's friend: to her, calista prov'd her conduct nice, and good simplicius asks of her advice. sudden, she storms! she raves! you tip the wink, but spare your censure; silia does not drink. all eyes may see from what the change arose, all eyes may see—a pimple on her nose.  papillia, wedded to her doating spark, sighs for the shades—"how charming is a park!" a park is purchas'd, but the fair he sees all bath'd in tears—"oh, odious, odious trees!"  ladies, like variegated tulips, show, 'tis to their changes that their charms they owe; their happy spots the nice admirer take, fine by defect, and delicately weak. 'twas thus calypso once each heart alarm'd, aw'd without virtue, without beauty charm'd; her tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her eyes, less wit than mimic, more a wit than wise; strange graces still, and stranger flights she had, was just not ugly, and was just not mad; yet ne'er so sure our passion to create, as when she touch'd the brink of all we hate.  narcissa's nature, tolerably mild, to make a wash, would hardly stew a child; has ev'n been prov'd to grant a lover's pray'r, and paid a tradesman once to make him stare, gave alms at easter, in a christian trim, and made a widow happy, for a whim. why then declare good nature is her scorn, when 'tis by that alone she can be borne? why pique all mortals, yet affect a name? a fool to pleasure, yet a slave to fame: now deep in taylor and the book of martyrs now drinking citron with his grace and chartres. now conscience chills her, and now passion burns; and atheism and religion take their turns; a very heathen in the carnal part, yet still a sad, good christian at her heart.  see sin in state, majestically drunk; proud as a peeress, prouder as a punk; chaste to her husband, frank to all beside, a teeming mistress, but a barren bride. what then? let blood and body bear the fault, her head's untouch'd, that noble seat of thought: such this day's doctrine—in another fit she sins with poets through pure love of wit. what has not fir'd her bosom or her brain? caesar and tallboy, charles and charlema'ne. as helluo, late dictator of the feast, the nose of hautgout, and the tip of taste, critiqu'd your wine, and analys'd your meat, yet on plain pudding deign'd at home to eat; so philomede, lect'ring all mankind on the soft passion, and the taste refin'd, th' address, the delicacy—stoops at once, and makes her hearty meal upon a dunce.  flavia's a wit, has too much sense to pray, to toast our wants and wishes, is her way; nor asks of god, but of her stars to give the mighty blessing, "while we live, to live." then all for death, that opiate of the soul! lucretia's dagger, rosamonda's bowl. say, what can cause such impotence of mind? a spark too fickle, or a spouse too kind. wise wretch! with pleasures too refin'd to please; with too much spirit to be e'er at ease; with too much quickness ever to be taught; with too much thinking to have common thought: you purchase pain with all that joy can give, and die of nothing but a rage to live.  turn then from wits; and look on simo's mate, no ass so meek, no ass so obstinate: or her, that owns her faults, but never mends, because she's honest, and the best of friends: or her, whose life the church and scandal share, for ever in a passion, or a prayer: or her, who laughs at hell, but (like her grace) cries, "ah! how charming, if there's no such place!" or who in sweet vicissitude appears of mirth and opium, ratafie and tears, the daily anodyne, and nightly draught, to kill those foes to fair ones, time and thought. woman and fool are two hard things to hit, for true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.  but what are these to great atossa's mind? scarce once herself, by turns all womankind! who, with herself, or others, from her birth finds all her life one warfare upon earth: shines, in exposing knaves, and painting fools, yet is, whate'er she hates and ridicules. no thought advances, but her eddy brain whisks it about, and down it goes again. full sixty years the world has been her trade, the wisest fool much time has ever made. from loveless youth to unrespected age, no passion gratified except her rage. so much the fury still outran the wit, the pleasure miss'd her, and the scandal hit. who breaks with her,-provokes revenge from hell, but he's a bolder man who dares be well. her every turn with violence pursu'd, nor more a storm her hate than gratitude. to that each passion turns, or soon or late; love, if it makes her yield, must make her hate: superiors? death! and equals? what a curse! but an inferior not dependant? worse. offend her, and she knows not to forgive; oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live: but die, and she'll adore you—then the bust and temple rise—then fall again to dust. last night, her lord was all that's good and great; a knave this morning, and his will a cheat. strange! by the means defeated of the ends, by spirit robb'd of pow'r, by warmth of friends, by wealth of follow'rs! without one distress sick of herself through very selfishness! atossa, curs'd with ev'ry granted pray'r, childless with all her children, wants an heir. to heirs unknown descends th' unguarded store, or wanders, heav'n-directed, to the poor.  pictures like these, dear madam, to design, asks no firm hand, and no unerring line; some wand'ring touch or some reflected light, some flying stroke alone can hit 'em right: for how should equal colours do the knack? chameleons who can paint in white and black?  "yet chloe sure was form'd without a spot"— nature in her then err'd not, but forgot. "with ev'ry pleasing, ev'ry prudent part, say, what can chloe want?"—she wants a heart. she speaks, behaves, and acts just as she ought; but never, never, reach'd one gen'rous thought. virtue she finds too painful an endeavour, content to dwell in decencies for ever. so very reasonable, so unmov'd, as never yet to love, or to be lov'd. she, while her lover pants upon her breast, can mark the figures on an indian chest; and when she sees her friend in deep despair, observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair. forbid it heav'n, a favour or a debt she e'er should cancel—but she may forget. safe is your secret still in chloe's ear; but none of chloe's shall you ever hear. of all her dears she never slander'd one, but cares not if a thousand are undone. would chloe know if you're alive or dead? she bids her footman put it in her head. chloe is prudent—would you too be wise? then never break your heart when chloe dies.  one certain portrait may (i grant) be seen, which heav'n has varnish'd out, and made a queen : the same for ever! and describ'd by all with truth and goodness, as with crown and ball. poets heap virtues, painters gems at will, and show their zeal, and hide their want of skill. 'tis well—but, artists! who can paint or write, to draw the naked is your true delight. that robe of quality so struts and swells, none see what parts of nature it conceals. th' exactest traits of body or of mind, we owe to models of an humble kind. if queensbury to strip there's no compelling, 'tis from a handmaid we must take a helen. from peer or bishop 'tis no easy thing to draw the man who loves his god, or king: alas! i copy (or my draught would fail) from honest mah'met, or plain parson hale.  but grant, in public men sometimes are shown, a woman's seen in private life alone: our bolder talents in full light display'd; your virtues open fairest in the shade. bred to disguise, in public 'tis you hide; there, none distinguish twixt your shame or pride, weakness or delicacy; all so nice, that each may seem a virtue, or a vice.  in men, we various ruling passions find; in women, two almost divide the kind; those, only fix'd, they first or last obey, the love of pleasure, and the love of sway. that, nature gives; and where the lesson taught is still to please, can pleasure seem a fault? experience, this; by man's oppression curs'd, they seek the second not to lose the first.  men, some to bus'ness, some to pleasure take; but ev'ry woman is at heart a rake: men, some to quiet, some to public strife; but ev'ry lady would be queen for life.  yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens! pow'r all their end, but beauty all the means. in youth they conquer, with so wild a rage, as leaves them scarce a subject in their age: for foreign glory, foreign joy, they roam; no thought of peace or happiness at home. but wisdom's triumph is well-tim'd retreat, as hard a science to the fair as great! beauties, like tyrants, old and friendless grown, yet hate repose, and dread to be alone, worn out in public, weary ev'ry eye, nor leave one sigh behind them when they die.  pleasures the sex, as children birds, pursue, still out of reach, yet never out of view; sure, if they catch, to spoil the toy at most, to covet flying, and regret when lost: at last, to follies youth could scarce defend, it grows their age's prudence to pretend; asham'd to own they gave delight before, reduc'd to feign it, when they give no more: as hags hold sabbaths, less for joy than spite, so these their merry, miserable night; still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide, and haunt the places where their honour died.  see how the world its veterans rewards! a youth of frolics, an old age of cards; fair to no purpose, artful to no end, young without lovers, old without a friend, a fop their passion, but their prize a sot, alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot!  ah, friend! to dazzle let the vain design, to raise the thought and touch the heart, be thine! that charm shall grow, while what fatigues the ring, flaunts and goes down, an unregarded thing: so when the sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight, all mild ascends the moon's more sober light, serene in virgin modesty she shines, and unobserv'd the glaring orb declines.  oh! blest with temper, whose unclouded ray can make tomorrow cheerful as today; she, who can love a sister's charms, or hear sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear; she, who ne'er answers till a husband cools, or, if she rules him, never shows she rules; charms by accepting, by submitting sways, yet has her humour most, when she obeys; let fops or fortune fly which way they will; disdains all loss of tickets, or codille; spleen, vapours, or smallpox, above them all, and mistress of herself, though china fall.  and yet, believe me, good as well as ill, woman's at best a contradiction still. heav'n, when it strives to polish all it can its last best work, but forms a softer man; picks from each sex, to make the fav'rite blest, your love of pleasure, our desire of rest: blends, in exception to all gen'ral rules, your taste of follies, with our scorn of fools: reserve with frankness, art with truth allied, courage with softness, modesty with pride, fix'd principles, with fancy ever new; shakes all together, and produces—you.  be this a woman's fame: with this unblest, toasts live a scorn, and queens may die a jest. this phoebus promis'd (i forget the year) when those blue eyes first open'd on the sphere; ascendant phoebus watch'd that hour with care, averted half your parents' simple pray'r, and gave you beauty, but denied the pelf which buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself. the gen'rous god, who wit and gold refines, and ripens spirits as he ripens mines, kept dross for duchesses, the world shall know it, to you gave sense, good humour, and a poet.  
NEW POEM
 she has attained the permanence she dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning. untended stalks blow over her even and swift, like young men running.  always in the heart she loved others had lived,—she heard their laughter. she lies where none has lain before, where certainly none will follow after.  
NEW POEM
 at once this dragnet of cousins whips its way into your presence saying none of them among us. they are oracles on the court of midnight, the tight filigree of a mind or your splashing around in, your pandemonium of copper graffiti inexpertly put up. they make weapons of furled hands. “we will walk, but our bones will carry ribbons of lead, or we will, like acrobats mill-headed in 3s (3 blades, 3 hips, 3 tongues), answer to what comes before, what comes before?” eleousa, master of dark eyelids, eye opening like a fennel seed, you are generous or are you not, do you shore up and wink at the soul? what does the soul say other than “my divorce from . . .,” “tan holiday . . .,” “smoking crystal in teak rooms . . .” but should have asked, “what do you see?” the sun a sequence of fans, a bridge, only so exquisitely cabled as to make us still—shall we fall or travel between bridges among the robust, sane clouds, a face cut from smoke, heat, and light? the sun, dancing in a vial, the initial memory of what it was to be born— doberman of a sheer-white universe— to school out—the audacity of rising without name or color to new rooms, new youth, fruitful, born singularly to precise moments not in epiphany but duration—as under new weather we become—in action, receive—our bodies uncasked like umbrellas under the flamingo-red light of the racing day.  
NEW POEM
 why hast thou nothing in thy face? thou idol of the human race, thou tyrant of the human heart, the flower of lovely youth that art; yea, and that standest in thy youth an image of eternal truth, with thy exuberant flesh so fair, that only pheidias might compare, ere from his chaste marmoreal form time had decayed the colours warm; like to his gods in thy proud dress, thy starry sheen of nakedness.  surely thy body is thy mind, for in thy face is nought to find, only thy soft unchristen’d smile, that shadows neither love nor guile, but shameless will and power immense, in secret sensuous innocence.  o king of joy, what is thy thought? i dream thou knowest it is nought, and wouldst in darkness come, but thou makest the light where’er thou go. ah yet no victim of thy grace, none who e’er long’d for thy embrace, hath cared to look upon thy face.

 i heard a child, a little under four years old, when asked what was meant by being in good spirits, answer, “it is laughing, talking, and kissing.” —charles darwin, the expression of the emotions in man and animals 1.   waldorf-astoria euphoria, the joy of big cities  joy, when intense, leads to various purposeless movements—to dancing about, clapping the hands, stamping, etc.  
NEW POEM
 pomegranates fell from the trees in our sleep. if we stayed in the sun too long there were aloes to cool the burn. henbane for predators and succulents when the rain was scarce.  there was no glorified past to point the way true and natural for the sexes to meet. he kept looking to the heavens as if the answer were anywhere but here. i was so bored with our goodness i couldn’t suck the juice from one more pear.  it’s here, i kept telling him, here, rooted in the soil like every other tree you know. and i wove us a bed of its uppermost branches.  
NEW POEM
 then there's the yemeni legend of eve in the garden knitting a pattern on the serpent's back, the snake unfinished like the rest of creation, the first woman thinking to add design, a sheath of interlocking diamonds and stripes along that sensuous s, knitting giving her time to learn what's infinitely possible with a few stitches, twisting cables, hers a plan to mirror the divine inner layer that can't be shed no matter what it rubs up against.  
NEW POEM
 (after raymond carver’s hummingbird ) suppose i said the word “springtime” and i wrote the words “king salmon” on a piece of paper and mailed it to you. when you opened it would you remember that afternoon we spent together in the yellow boat when the early whales were feeding and we caught our first fish of the year?  or would you remember that time off cape flattery when you were a little girl: your father smoking, telling stories as he ran the boat, then the tug and zing of that very first fish spooling off into the gray-green world; you laughing and brushing back your hair before setting the hook?  i know i am hard to understand sometimes particularly when you are standing at the post office with only a piece of paper saying “king salmon” on it but just think of it as a promissary note and that electric tug, that thrill pulling your mind into deep water is how i feel about you every, single day.  
NEW POEM
 when a man knows another man is looking for him he doesn’t hide.  he doesn’t wait to spend another night with his wife or put his children to sleep.  he puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit and goes to the barber shop to let another man shave him.  he shuts his eyes remembers himself as a boy lying naked on a rock by the water.  then he asks for the special lotion. the old men line up by the chair and the barber pours a little in each of their hands.  
NEW POEM
 when love was a question, the message arrived in the beak of a wire and plaster bird. the coloratura was hardly to be believed. for flight,  it took three stagehands: two on the pulleys and one on the flute. and you thought fancy rained like grace.  our fog machine lost in the parcel post, we improvised with smoke. the heroine dies of tuberculosis after all. remorse and the raw night air: any plausible tenor  might cough. the passions, i take my clues from an obvious source, may be less like climatic events than we conventionalize, though i’ve heard  of tornadoes that break the second-best glassware and leave everything else untouched. there’s a finer conviction than seamlessness  elicits: the greeks knew a god by the clanking behind his descent. the heart, poor pump, protests till you’d think  it’s rusted past redemption, but there’s tuning in these counterweights, celebration’s assembled voice.  
NEW POEM
 (lines 71-99) frost shall freeze fire eat wood earth shall breed ice shall bridge water a shield wear. one shall break frost’s fetters free the grain from wonder-lock —one who all can.  winter shall wane fair weather come again the sun-warmed summer! the sound unstill the deep dead wave is darkest longest. holly shall to the pyre hoard be scattered when the body’s numb. name is best.  a king shall win a queen with goods beakers, bracelets. both must first be kind with gifts. courage must wax war-mood in the man, the woman grow up beloved among her people, be light of mood hold close a rune-word be roomy-hearted at hoard-share and horse-giving. when the hall drinks she shall always and everywhere before any company greet first the father of aethelings with the first draught —deft to his hand she holds the horn— and when they are at home together know the right way to run their household.  the ship must be nailed the shield framed from the light linden. but how loving the welcome of the frisian wife when floats offshore the keel come home again! she calls him within walls,  her own husband —hull’s at anchor!— washes salt-stains from his stiff shirt brings out clothes clean and fresh for her lord on land again. love’s need is met.  
NEW POEM
 i lied when pops asked, but i’ll admit it now. i did touch the blue egg to see if, somehow, it felt as much like the sky as it looked. the egg: speckled in its twiggy nest, eye level to 8-year-olds, perfect &amp; off-limits like the baoding balls on pops’ desk. we tried to find its mom, but the finches scattered when we came near. one twittered the alarm from a maple. others balanced on wires, flapped wings at us like we were gravity. i can still see how carefully garrett scooped the egg from the nest, then headed out to find a spot on the march concrete to drop it.i want to see if these things break into pieces or in half like on tv  
NEW POEM
 weasel and the ponce were having a confab under the chinaberry tree, in the shade of the dusty old tree— pious weasel, indefatigable ponce.  abroad in the land were pickings to be had, marks beyond measure, fat aplenty for tooth and hand. will and cunning are the clean, bright edges  of a creature in the wild, of a vigorous man, so that goodness finds sustenance, charity nurture, in quietude, in quietude within. the nose will relate to you a world,  a world entire, from the merest trace of wind— the topography of weakness, gold in a river’s sand. and there they sniffed, sniffed and with hooded eye conspired,  in the shadows thrown by the dusty old tree. trading knowledge, whetting tools, they made ready for their necessary enterprise, the fate nature bestowed. all the while  drinking in each other’s aspect: they found uncommon pleasure there, did weasel and his friend, in the other’s smile and guise, as a young girl in flattering light,  as a darling young girl by her reflection might— the two of them, lovely beyond compare in the shade of the chinaberry tree. groomed, laved with blandishment,  almost gilded in the hours afternoon turns to evening and evening, stealthily, to night, how would they have noticed the rustle in the thicket, felt the heat of its burning eyes?  
NEW POEM
 two women with the same claim came to the feet of the wise king. two women, but only one baby. the king knew someone was lying. what he said was let the child be cut in half; that way no one will go empty-handed. he drew his sword. then, of the two women, one renounced her share: this was the sign, the lesson. suppose you saw your mother torn between two daughters: what could you do to save her but be willing to destroy yourself—she would know who was the rightful child, the one who couldn’t bear to divide the mother.  
NEW POEM
 it is very stretchy. we know that, even if many details remain sketchy. it is complexly woven. that much too has pretty well been proven. we are loath to continue our lessons which consist of slaps as sharp and dispersed as bee stings from a smashed nest when any strand snaps—  hurts working far past the locus of rupture, attacking threads far beyond anything we would have said connects.  
NEW POEM
 it was sunday, before dinner. my uncles were listening to the opera. o.z. and i carried my brother in and laid him on the table. the women started screaming. my brother raised up on his side with dried blood on his hands, we killed those goddamn canale brothers and nobody is ever going to touch us! the men shut their eyes and danced. we drank until morning when everything was quiet. they wiped their eyes, kissed us goodbye and left.  
NEW POEM
 i drove to oak park, took two tours, and looked at some of the houses. i took the long way back along the lake. the place that i came home to—a cavernous apartment on the east side of milwaukee— seems basically a part of that tradition, with the same admixture of expansion and restraint: the space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense that while the superficial conflicts got resolved, the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium, it isn’t yet a place in which i feel that i can live. imagine someone reading. contemplate a man oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations, yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure, in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe and where the heart can stay—not by discovering it, but by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture, and in the unconstructed life that it contains. in a late and very brief remark, freud speculates that space is the projection of a “psychic apparatus” which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself; and wright extols “that primitive sense of shelter” which can turn a house into a refuge from despair. i wish that time could bring the future back again and let me see things as they used to seem to me before i found myself alone, in an emancipated state— alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow. there used to be a logic in the way time passed that made it flow directly towards an underlying space where all the minor, individual lives converged. the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past and bathed the future in a soft, familiar light i remembered from home, and which has faded. and the voices get supplanted by the rain, the nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air, while in its place a kind of monument appears, magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity and standing in a small and singular expanse— as though the years had been a pretext for reflection, and my life had been a phase of disenchantment— as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw, the reassuring settings slowly melt away, and what remains is just a sense of getting older. in a variation of the parable, the pure of heart descend into a kingdom that they never wanted and refused to see. the homely notions of the good, the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like adolescent fictions as the real forms of life deteriorate with manically increasing speed, the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter, and the serenity it brings—not in reflection, but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken, of losing everything, of acquiescing in the obvious approach (the house shaped like a box; the life that can’t accommodate another’s)— as the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things.  why can’t the more expansive ecstasies come true? i met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958, in mrs. wolford’s eighth grade history class. all moments weigh the same, and matter equally; yet those that time brings back create the fables of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes passing on the way to either peace or disappointment— like a paper calendar on which  it’s always autumn and we’re back in school again; or a hazy afternoon near the beginning of october, with the world series playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open, and the california sunlight filling up the room. when i survey the mural stretched across the years —across my heart—i notice mostly small, neglected parts of no importance to the whole design, but which, in their obscurity, seem more permanent and real. i see the desks and auditorium, suffused with yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that still remains there, in a space pervaded by a soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate— as though the future weren’t real, and the present were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to, and the past were there forever. and the art that time inflicts upon its subjects can’t eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood, which harden into shapes as it recedes. i wish i knew a way of looking at the world that didn’t find it wanting, or of looking at my life that didn’t always see a half-completed structure made of years and filled with images and gestures emblematic of the past, like gatsby’s light, or proust’s imbalance on the stones. i wish there were a place where i could stay and leave the world alone—an enormous stadium where i could wander back and forth across a field replete with all the incidents and small details that gave the days their textures, that bound the minutes into something solid, and that linked them all together in a way that used to seem eternal. we used to go to dances in my family’s ancient cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening climbing up the hill outside del mar. and later i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles’ baby-butcher album at your house in mission bay; and three years later listening to the velvet underground performing in a roller skating rink. years aren’t texts, or anything like texts; and yet i often think of 1968 that way, as though that single year contained the rhythms of the rest, as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey’s hair. the parts were real, and yet the dense and living whole they once composed seems broken now, its voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me more distantly each day, until the tangled years are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a sequence of the places where we lived: your parents’ house in kensington, and mine above the canyon: then the flat by sears in cambridge, where we moved when we got married, and the third floor of the house on francis avenue, near harvard square; the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the year that john was born, and last of all the house in whitefish bay, where you live now and all those years came inexplicably undone in mid-july. the sequence ended late last year. suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world as it exists for one. then half of mine has ended, while the fragment which has recently come to be contains no vantage point from which to see it whole. i think that people are the sum of their illusions, that the cares that make them difficult to see are eased by distance, with their errors blending in an intricate harmony, their truths abiding in a subtle “spark” or psyche (each incomparable, yet each the same as all the others) and their disparate careers all joined together in a tangled moral vision whose intense, meandering design seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling, as in grief, or in the pathos of a life cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate, because the most important thing is human happiness— not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real. the whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate reflections on the day that came at evening, whose significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood, because the facts were almost always unexceptional. two years ago we took our son to paris. last night i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show, and then took him home. i look at all the houses as i walk down hackett avenue to work. i teach my classes, visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself, yet in the end the minutes don’t add up. what’s lost is the perception of the world as something good and held in common; as a place to be perfected in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters that endowed it with integrity and structure, and that merged its private moments with the past. what broke it into pieces? what transformed the flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and smoldering resentment—like coming home too early, or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob? i wish that life could be a window on the sun, instead of just this porch where i can stand and contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution. the guggenheim museum just reopened. tonight i watched a segment of the news on pbs—narrated by a woman we met years ago at bob’s—that showed how most of wright’s interior had been restored, and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky. i like the houses better—they flow in all directions, merging with the scenery and embodying a milder, more domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale that doesn’t overwhelm the life that it encloses. isn’t there a way to feel at home within the confines of this bland, accommodating structure made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished prairie school house in whitefish bay—the lineal, reduced descendant of the “flameproof” wright house just a block or two away from where i live now? i usually walk along the street on sunday, musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it recapitulate the oak park house and studio, with open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior, and with the entrance half-concealed on the side— a characteristic feature of his plans that made it difficult to find, although the hope was that in trying to get inside, the visitor’s eye would come to linger over subtleties he might have failed to see— in much the way that in the course of getting older, and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here, i found myself pulled backwards through these old, uncertain passages, distracted by the details, and meeting only barriers to understanding why the years unfolded as they did, and why my life turned out the way it has—like his signature “pathway of discovery,” with each diversion adding to the integrity of the whole.  there is this sweep life has that makes the accidents of time and place seem small. everything alters, and the personal concerns that love could hold together for a little while decay, and then the world seems strange again, and meaningless and free. i miss the primitive confusions, and the secret way things came to me each evening, and the pain. i still wonder where the tears went, standing in my room each day and quietly inhabiting a calm, suspended state enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me, with the background noise cascading out of nothing like a song that makes the days go by, a song incorporating everything—not into what it says, but simply in the way it touches me, a single image of dispersal, the inexhaustible perception of contingency and transience and isolation. it brings them back to me. i have the inwardness i think i must have wanted, and the quietude, the solitary temper, and this space where i can linger with the silence curling all around me like the sound of pure passage, waiting here surrounded by the furniture, the books and lists and all these other emblems of the floating world, the prints of raindrops that begin as mist, that fall discreetly through the atmosphere, and disappear. and then i feel them in the air, in a reserved, more earthly music filled with voices reassembling in a wellspring of remembrance, talking to me again, and finding shelter in the same evasive movements i can feel in my own life, cloaked in a quiet dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old, and fading out of other people’s consciousness, and dying –with its deepest insecurities and fears concealed by their own protective colorations, as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home. it has the texture of an uncreated substance, hovering between the settings it had come to love and some unformulated state i can’t imagine— waiting for the telephone to ring, obsessed with ways to occupy these wide, unstructured hours, and playing records by myself, and waking up alone. all things are disparate, yet subject to the same intense, eradicating wills of time and personality, like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build between our lives and emptiness, the certainty they seemed to have just two or three short years ago, before the anger spread its poison over everything. i think about the way our visions locked together in a nightmare play of nervousness and language, living day to day inside the concentrated force of that relentless argument, whose words swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety, two people clinging to their versions of their lives almost like children—living out each other’s intermittent fantasies, that fed upon themselves as though infected by some vile, concentrated hatred; who then woke up and planned that evening’s dinner. it’s all memories now, and distance. miles away the cat is sleeping on the driveway, john’s in school, and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen. nothing really changes—the external world intrudes and then withdraws, and then becomes continuous again. i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant lanterns made of opalescent art glass—part, i guess, of what this morning’s paper called the “wright craze.” i like the easy way the days go by, the parts of aging that have come to seem familiar, and the uneventful calm that seems to settle on the house at night. each morning brings the mirror’s reassuring face, as though the years had left the same enduring person simplified and changed—no longer vaguely desperate, no longer torn, yet still impatient with himself and still restless; but drained of intricacy and rage, like a mild paradox—uninteresting in its own right, yet existing for the sake of something stranger. now and then our life comes over me, in brief, involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom unexpectedly, in fleeting moments of regret that come before the ache, the pang that gathers sharply, like an indrawn breath—a strange and thoughtful kind of pain, as though a steel band had somehow snapped inside my heart. i don’t know. but what i do know is that none of it is ever going to come to me again. why did i think a person only distantly like me might finally represent my life? what aspects of my attitudes, my cast of mind, my inconclusive way of tossing questions at the world had i supposed might realize another person’s fantasies and turn her into someone else—who gradually became a separate part of me, and argued with the very words i would have used, and looked at me through eyes i’d looked at as though gazing at myself? i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams, or in these self-reflexive reveries sustaining all the charms that contemplation holds—until the long enchantment of the soul with what it sees is lifted, and it startles at a space alight with objects of its infantile gaze, like people in a mall. i saw her just the other day. i felt a kind of comfort at her face, one tinctured with bemusement at the strange and guarded person she’d become— attractive, vaguely friendly, brisk (too brisk), but no one i could think might represent my life. why did i even try to see myself in what’s outside? the strangeness pushes it away, propels the vision back upon itself, into these regions filled with shapes that i can wander through and never see, as though their image were inherently unreal. the houses on a street, the quiet backyard shade, the room restored to life with bric-a-brac— i started by revisiting these things, then slowly reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible that balanced sympathy and space inside an abstract edifice combining reaches of the past with all these speculations, all this artful preening of the heart. i sit here at my desk, perplexed and puzzled, teasing out a tangled skein of years we wove together, and trying to combine the fragments of those years into a poem. who cares if life—if someone’s actual life—is finally insignificant and small? there’s still a splendor in the way it flowers once and fades and leaves a carapace behind. there isn’t time to linger over why it happened, or attempt to make its mystery come to life again and last, like someone still embracing the confused perceptions of himself embedded in the past, as though eternity lay there— for heaven’s a delusion, and eternity is in the details, and this tiny, insubstantial life is all there is. —and that would be enough, but for the reoccurring dreams i often have of you. sometimes at night the banished unrealities return, as though a room suffused with light and poetry took shape around me. pictures line the walls. it’s early summer. somewhere in remembrance of thingspast, marcel, reflecting on his years with “albertine”—with x— suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance, of the separation of two lives in time and space. i think the same estrangement’s mirrored in each life, in how it seems both adequate and incomplete—part day-to-day existence, part imaginary construct beckoning at night, and sighing through my dreams like some disconsolate chimera, or the subject of a lonely, terrifying sadness; or the isolation of a quiet winter evening, when the house feels empty, and silence intervenes. but in the wonderful enclosure opening in my heart, i seem to recognize our voices lilting in the yard, inflected by the rhythms of a song whose words are seamless and whose lines are never-ending. i can almost see the contours of your face, and sense the presence of the trees, and reimagine all of us together in a deep, abiding happiness, as if the three of us inhabited a fragile, made-up world that seemed to be so permanent, so real. i have this fantasy: it’s early in the evening. you and i are sitting in the backyard, talking. friends arrive, then drinks and dinner, conversation…  the lovely summer twilight lasts forever…  what’s the use? what purpose do these speculations serve? what mild enchantments do these meditations leave? they’re just the murmurs of an age, of middle age, that help to pass the time that they retrieve before subsiding, leaving everything unchanged. each of us at times has felt the future fade, or seen the compass of his life diminished, or realized some tangible illusion was unreal. driving down to evanston last week, i suddenly remembered driving down that road eight years ago, so caught up in some story i’d just finished that i’d missed the way the countryside was changing— how in place of trees there now were office towers and theme parks, parts of a confusingly panoply of barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape filled with high, receding clouds and rows of flimsy houses in what used to be a field. i thought of other people’s lives, and how impossible it seemed to grasp them on the model of my own—as little mirrors of infinity—or sense their forms of happiness, or in their minor personal upheavals feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale and see its abstract argument made visible. i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude— how life lacks shape until it’s given one by love, and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself and part of some incorporating whole that feels and has a face and lets it live forever. all of these seemed true, and cancelled one another, leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence tracing out the contours of a world erased, like music tracing out the contours of the mind— for life has the form of a winding curve in space and in its wake the human figure disappears. look at our surroundings—where a previous age could visualize a landscape we see borders, yet i think the underlying vision is the same: a person positing a world that he can see and can’t contain, and vexed by other people. everything is possible; some of it seemed real or nearly real, yet in the end it spoke to me alone, in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager ledge above a waterfall, or rolling across a vast, expanding plain on which there’s always room, but only room for one. it starts and ends inside an ordinary room, while in the interim brimming with illusions, filled with commonplace delights that make the days go by, with simple arguments and fears, and with the nervous inkling of some vague, utopian conceit transforming both the landscape and our lives, until we look around and find ourselves at home, but in a wholly different world. and even those catastrophes that seemed to alter everything seem fleeting, grounded in a natural order all of us are subject to, and ought to celebrate. —yet why? that things are temporary doesn’t render them unreal, unworthy of regretting. it’s not as though the past had never happened: all those years were real, and their loss was real, and it is sad—i don’t know what else to call it. i’m glad that both of us seem happy. yet what troubles me is just the way what used to be a world turned out, in retrospect, to be a state of mind, and no more tangible than that. and now it’s gone, and in its place i find the image of a process of inexorable decay, or of some great unraveling that drags the houses forward into emptiness and backwards into pictures of the intervening days love pieced together out of nothing. and i’m certain that this austere vision finally is true, and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe. it comes from much too high above the world and seems to me too hopeless, too extreme— but then i found myself one winter afternoon remembering a quiet morning in a classroom and inventing everything again, in ordinary terms that seemed to comprehend a childish dream of love, and then the loss of love, and all the intricate years between.

 ray’s third new car in half as many years. full cooler in the trunk, ray sogging the beer as i solemnly chauffeur us through the bush and up the backroads, hardly cowpaths and hub-deep in mud. all day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again. somewhere in the bush near saint john there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother who stayed on the land when ray left for the cities. one week ray is crocked. we’ve been through this before. even, as a little girl, hands in my dress, ah punka, you’s my debby, come and ki me.   then the road ends in a yard full of dogs. them’s indian dogs, ray says, lookit how they know me. and they do seem to know him, like i do. his odor— rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from metagoshe, and the inflammable mansmell: hair tonic, ashes, alcohol. ray dances an old woman up in his arms. fiddles reel in the phonograph and i sink apart in a corner, start knocking the blue ribbons down. four generations of people live here. no one remembers raymond twobears.  so what. the walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud sails back into the middle of metagoshe. a three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline, so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine. then somehow ray pries the beak open and shoves down a cherry bomb. lights the string tongue.  headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow’s soup. ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in to sleep his own head off. tomorrow i find that the animal has dragged itself off. i follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh.  ray finds his way back through the room into his arms. when the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands and the boys and their old man fold him into the car where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out.  somehow we find our way back. uncle ray sings an old song to the body that pulls him toward home. the gray fins that his hands have become screw their bones in the dashboard. his face has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived for a long time underwater. and the angels come lowering their slings and litters.

 oui, pour jamais chassons l’image de la volage que j’adorais.              parny. matilda, farewell! fate has doom’d us to part, but the prospect occasions no pang to my heart; no longer is love with my reason at strife, though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.  as together we roam’d, i the passion confess’d, which thy beauty and virtue had rais’d in my breast; that the passion was mutual thou mad’st me believe, and i thought my matilda could never deceive.  my matilda! no, false one! my claims i resign: thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine: i now scorn thee as much as i lov’d thee before, nor sigh when i think i shall meet thee no more.  though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find, while folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind, though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize, thou art shunn’d by the good, and contemn’d by the wise.  than mine what affection more fervent could be, when i thought ev’ry virtue was center’d in thee? of the vows thou hast broken i will not complain, for i mourn not the loss of a heart i disdain.  oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov’d as that fancied perfection i formerly lov’d, nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul, could have dimm’d the dear image then stamp’d on my soul.  how bright were the pictures, untinted with shade, by hope’s glowing pencil on fancy pourtray’d! sweet visions of bliss! which i could not retain; for they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.  some other, perhaps, to matilda is dear, some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere; may he fix thy light passions, now wav’ring as air, then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!  repent not, matilda, return not to me: unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be: in vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum’d, for love, once extinguish’d, is never relum’d.

 the tint of the sky between sunset and night.  and wandering with you and your nephew in that maze, half-lost—madrid of the austrias—looking for plaza of the green  cross where, days before you arrived, an opel with false plates was parked, its wheels straddling the curb, and so the van  heading for the barracks that morning had to slow to squeeze past . . . back at the hotel your mom  is holding up her gift—amethyst, she says admiring how light when passing through a prism  bends. at his window that morning before we began my student said, ¡qué bonito!, watching it drift and descend, settling on roofs and cars.  and i think of you and your wife and daughter: getting to see madrid in white, your visit winding down, and how  i had wanted that lesson to end to get to the park—retiro, they say, is the city’s one lung, and the way the feel and sound of steps  cease when grass is completely covered as if walking on a cloud. the year before  on a visit from the coast, a friend sitting at a window watched the flakes flutter  and fall, dissolving before reaching the ground—aguanieve, he said while from a town near seville  b-52s were lifting off . . . i was in a trance that week though like most things the war  in the gulf was soon another backdrop, like the string of car bombs the following year. and yet that morning  as soon as i heard, something led me not to the park but down to city hall, workers in the street  evacuated, sipping coffee, though i never reached the site—of course it was cordoned off, the spray of glass, the heap  of twisted metal, and so later learned their names their lives. of the five there was one: a postal clerk who  as a boy, would plunge his hands into the white, the cold a sweet jolt  whenever he got to touch the stuff, scooping it tightly into a ball  like the ones he would dodge and throw years later at his wife-to-be: those weekends,  those places—away from city air— a release . . . miraflores, siete picos, rascafría . . .it’s in  his blood, she would come to say chatting with a neighbor about his thing for snow—the way it falls  softly, blanketing roofs and groves, villages nestled in the sierra’s  hills: it is february and she is picturing him and the boy, up there now  playing, horsing around

 several of my cousins lean up against the house, taking long drags from the pack of marlboros we share. we have always been this way —addicted and generous. a pow wow tape plays from inside the open garage where two old uncles are thinking to themselves in the safety of its shadows. our aunties are in the kitchen, preparing the boiled meat and chokecherry soup and laughing about old jokes they still hang onto because these things are a matter of survival. outside, we ask about who was driving around with who last night, where so-and-so got beat up, whose girlfriend left him for someone else. (but she’ll go back to him, we all think to ourselves.) aunties carry the full pots and pans to the picnic table, an uncle prays over our food in assiniboine. we all want to forget that we don’t understand this language, we spend lots of time trying to forget in different ways. no one notices that the wild turnips are still simmering in a pot on the stove.

 crow school is basic and short as a rule— just the rudiments of quid pro crow for most students. then each lives out his unenlightened span, adding his bit of blight to the collected history of pushing out the sweeter species; briefly swaggering the swagger of his aggravating ancestors down my street. and every time i like him when we meet.

 the boys who fled my father's house in fear of what his wrath would cost them if he found them nibbling slowly at his daughter's ear, would vanish out the back without a sound, and glide just like the shadow of a crow, to wait beside the elm tree in the snow. something quite deadly rumbled in his voice. he sniffed the air as if he knew the scent of teenage boys, and asked, "what was that noise?" then i'd pretend to not know what he meant, stand mutely by, my heart immense with dread, as father set the traps and went to bed.

 i like to touch your tattoos in complete darkness, when i can’t see them. i’m sure of where they are, know by heart the neat lines of lightning pulsing just above your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent twists, facing a dragon. when i pull you  to me, taking you until we’re spent and quiet on the sheets, i love to kiss the pictures in your skin. they’ll last until you’re seared to ashes; whatever persists or turns to pain between us, they will still be there. such permanence is terrifying. so i touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying.

 wherever the flamingo goes, she brings a city’s worth of furbelows. she seems unnatural by nature— too vivid and peculiar a structure to be pretty, and flexible to the point of oddity. perched on those legs, anything she does seems like an act. descending on her egg or draping her head along her back, she’s too exact and sinuous to convince an audience she’s serious. the natural elect, they think, would be less pink, less able to relax their necks, less flamboyant in general. they privately expect that it’s some poorly jointed bland grey animal with mitts for hands whom god protects.

 a species of tiny human has been discovered, which lived on the remote indonesian island of flores just 18,000 years ago. . . . researchers have so far unearthed remains from eight individuals who were just one metre tall, with grapefruit-sized skulls. these astonishing little people . . . made tools, hunted tiny elephants and lived at the same time as modern humans who were colonizing the area. —nature, october 2004 light: lifted, i stretch my brief body. color: blaze of day behind blank eyes.  sound: birds stab greedy beaks into trunk and seed, spill husk  onto the heap where my dreaming and my loving live.  every day i wake to this.  tracks follow the heavy beasts back to where they huddle, herd.  hunt: a dance against hunger. music: feast and fear.  this island becomes us.  trees cap our sky. it rustles with delight in a voice green as lust. reptiles  drag night from their tails, live by the dark. a rage of waves  protects the horizon, which we would devour. one day i want to dive in and drift,  legs and arms wracked with danger. like a dark star. i want to last.

 cut back the stems an inch to keep in bloom. so instructs the florist’s note enclosed inside the flowers. who knew what was cut could heal again, the green wounds close, stitching themselves together?  it doesn’t matter. the flowers, red and white, will bloom awhile, then wither. you sit in an unlit room and watch the vase throw crystal shadows through the dark. the flowers’ colors are so lovely they’re painful. in a week, you’ll have to throw them out.  it’s only hope that makes you take out scissors, separate each bloom and cut where you last measured. did you know venus was said to turn into a virgin each time she bathed? she did it as a mark of love. she did it  so as to please her lovers. perhaps, overwhelmed by pain, she eventually stopped bathing altogether. it doesn’t matter. it’s a pleasure to feel the green nubs stripped, watch the stems refresh under your blade. they’re here  because they’re beautiful. they glow inside your crystal vase. and yet the flowers by themselves are nothing: only a refraction of color that, in a week or two, will be thrown out. day by day, the water lowers. the red-  and-white heads droop, blacken at the stems. it doesn’t matter. even cut stems heal. but what is the point of pain if it heals? some things should last forever, instructs the florist’s note.pleasure, says one god.shame, says another.  venus heads, they call these flowers. in a week or two, you’ll lose the note, have to call the florist up. with sympathy, you’ll think he says. perhaps:with love. it doesn’t matter. you’ve stopped bathing. alone,  you sit before the crystal vase refracting you in pieces through the dark. you watch the pale skin bloom inside it, wither. you petal, inch by inch. you turn red and white together.

 o hideous little bat, the size of snot, with polyhedral eye and shabby clothes, to populate the stinking cat you walk the promontory of the dead man’s nose, climb with the fine leg of a duncan-phyfe the smoking mountains of my food and in a comic mood in mid-air take to bed a wife.  riding and riding with your filth of hair on gluey foot or wing, forever coy, hot from the compost and green sweet decay, sounding your buzzer like an urchin toy— you dot all whiteness with diminutive stool, in the tight belly of the dead burrow with hungry head and inlay maggots like a jewel.  at your approach the great horse stomps and paws bringing the hurricane of his heavy tail; shod in disease you dare to kiss my hand which sweeps against you like an angry flail; still you return, return, trusting your wing to draw you from the hunter’s reach that learns to kill to teach disorder to the tinier thing.  my peace is your disaster. for your death children like spiders cup their pretty hands and wives resort to chemistry of war. in fens of sticky paper and quicksands you glue yourself to death. where you are stuck you struggle hideously and beg, you amputate your leg imbedded in the amber muck.  but i, a man, must swat you with my hate, slap you across the air and crush your flight, must mangle with my shoe and smear your blood, expose your little guts pasty and white, knock your head sidewise like a drunkard’s hat, pin your wings under like a crow’s, tear off your flimsy clothes and beat you as one beats a rat.  then like gargantua i stride among the corpses strewn like raisins in the dust, the broken bodies of the narrow dead that catch the throat with fingers of disgust. i sweep. one gyrates like a top and falls and stunned, stone blind, and deaf buzzes its frightful f and dies between three cannibals.

 their singer suffered breakdowns. in their work there was a sense of what it was to live there at that time. one song described the dark around the military vehicles between them and the cocaine waiting in gramercy. it was about the sepsis that followed love or love repeated as farce, the neck neck neck damaged by an anonymous hand unstringing guitars. they got away with it and worked to abolish youth by knitting and paying half-attention. i thought i was in love because my sentiments were matched by a generic, abiding sense of unfreedom. nothing survives lovers descrying the red flags of old flames. nothing is more relatable than an unreasonable person operating subtractively, indulgently, out of exasperation.

 remember after work you grabbed our skateboard, crouched like a surfer, wingtips over the edge; wheels clacketing down the pocked macadam, you veered almost straight into the neighbor's hedge? we ran after you laughing, shouting, wait!  or that august night you swept us to the fair? the tallest person boarding the ferris wheel, you rocked our car right when we hit the apex above the winking midway, to make us squeal. next we raced you to the games, shouting, wait!  at your funeral, relatives and neighbors, shaking our hands, said, "so young to have died!" but we've dreamt you're just skating streets away, striding the fairgrounds toward a wilder ride. and we're still straggling behind, shouting,wait—!

 for those who ran in the streets, there were no faces to welcome them back. josé escaped and loved the war.  for those who swam with bitterness of a scorched love, there was a rusted car to work on.  for those who merely passed and reclined in prayer, there was the tower and the cross.  for those who dedicated tongues to the living and dying, there were turquoise painted doorways.  for those who left their children tied to the water heater, there was a shout and a name.  for those whose world was real and beautiful, there was a cigarette and a saint.  for those who asked josé to stay and feed his children, there were flowers at their funerals.  for those who carried a shovel tattooed on their backs, there was a wet towel and a bottle.  for those who swept the street of superstition and lie, there was the house to come home to.  for those who came home late and put their swollen feet up, there was love and the smell of dirty socks.  for those who feared the devil and spit on his painted arms, there was a lesson in rosaries.  for those who had to leave before the sun went down, there was asphalt and a bus.  for those who stared at wet plaster and claimed the face of christ appeared, there was confinement and stale bread.  for those who talked with each other and said it was time to go, there was lead in the paint and on the tongue.  for those who left children behind, there was a strange world of sulphur and sparrow nests.  for those who accused their ancestors of eating salt, there were these hands tracing what was left after the sweat.

 i. blood  we wondered if the rumors got to her. i’d seen her with that other girl behind the stop and shop when i was walking home from school one day. i swear, the two of them were kissing, plain as that, the grass so high it brushed their cheeks. i told my teacher so, and maybe it was her who called their folks. before too long, it was like everyone in town had heard. we waited for them at the dime store once, where cedric grabbed her tits and said i’ll learn you how to love how god intended it, you ugly fucking dyke. thing was, she wasn’t ugly like you’d think. she had a certain quality, a shyness maybe, and i’d describe the way she laughed as kind of gentle. anyway, we never saw her with that girl again. they say she got depressed— shit, at the service all of us got tearful. i got to thinking what an awful sight it was, all that red blood—it wasn’t in the papers, but i heard melissa’s mother, who was the nurse in the emergency that night, say how she was just covered up in blood. i can’t think how you bring yourself to cut your throat like that yourself—i asked the counselor they called in to the school, and she said something like,what better ink to write the language of the heart? i guess it proves that stuff from bible school they say, that such a life of sin breeds misery.     ii. phlegm  “my brain is draining from my head,” he said as once again he blew his nose. the clock read 3 a.m.;  its second hand swept slowly through another viscous minute. dead to even nurses sticking them  for new ivs, the other ones slept off their benders soundlessly. “i’m losing my intelligence,”  he said, and blew. my patience waned. he thought he was the president: dementia, ks, hiv  were printed in his problem list. “and plus, i’m getting feverish.” i can’t recall his name, but i  remember hating him—grim wish that he would hurry up and die. just then, he took my hand, and kissed  the back of it as though i were a princess in his foreign land. “my lady, you are beautiful,”  he said, and coughed again. unsure of what to say, my own throat burned. he said, “you can’t know what i feel.”     iii. bile  a gun went off and killed a little girl the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer. i walked through central park; a black dog snarled at squirrels chattering like they had answers.  the day my friend was diagnosed with cancer i dreamed of killing someone with a knife. the squirrels, chattering, had likely answers to all my angry questions about life—  a homeboy threatened someone with a knife not far from where a cop showed off his gun, an angry answer to most questions about life. i watched the squirrels hop, the yuppies run;  the cop approached the black kids with his gun. i wondered how much longer she would live; the squirrels scattered when the homeboy ran. i wondered if she’d ever been in love,  i wondered who would pray for her to live, forgive her for her anger and her weaknesses. i wondered why it hurt to fall in love. the cop tried aiming past me, towards the woods.  forgive us for our anger, for our weaknesses: through central park, past the black dog’s snarls, the cop gave chase. a skirmish in the woods. the gun went off—no! shrieked a little girl.     iv. melancholy  we picked at it with sticks at first, until an older kid named samuel arrived. he dropped a heavy rock right on its skull; we watched as thick black slime began to ooze from somewhere just below its heart—or where we thought its heart should be. “raccoon,” said someone solemnly. the landscaper— sweat gleaming, like the polished figurines my mother wouldn’t ever let me touch— regarded us with keen suspicion from across the street. we learned what it could teach; like any body’s secrets, the sublime receded toward the fact of death. i knew both sadness, and disgust in love’s untruths.

 siwashing it out once in siuslaw forest  i slept under   rhododendron all night   blossoms fell shivering on   a sheet of cardboard feet stuck   in my pack hands deep   in my pockets barely   able   to   sleep. i remembered   when we were in school sleeping together   in a big warm bed we were   the youngest lovers when we broke up   we were still nineteen. now our   friends are married you teach   school back east i dont mind   living this way green hills   the long blue beach but sometimes   sleeping in the open i think back   when i had you.   a spring night in shokoku-ji  eight years ago this may we walked under cherry blossoms at night in an orchard in oregon. all that i wanted then is forgotten now, but you. here in the night in a garden of the old capital i feel the trembling ghost of yugao i remember your cool body naked under a summer cotton dress.   an autumn morning in shokoku-ji  last night watching the pleiades, breath smoking in the moonlight, bitter memory like vomit choked my throat. i unrolled a sleeping bag on mats on the porch under thick autumn stars. in dream you appeared (three times in nine years) wild, cold, and accusing. i woke shamed and angry: the pointless wars of the heart. almost dawn. venus and jupiter. the first time i have ever seen them close.   december at yase you said, that october, in the tall dry grass by the orchard when you chose to be free, “again someday, maybe ten years.”  after college i saw you one time. you were strange. and i was obsessed with a plan.  now ten years and more have gone by: i’ve always known where you were— i might have gone to you hoping to win your love back. you still are single.  i didn’t. i thought i must make it alone. i have done that.  only in dream, like this dawn, does the grave, awed intensity of our young love return to my mind, to my flesh.  we had what the others all crave and seek for; we left it behind at nineteen.  i feel ancient, as though i had lived many lives.  and may never now know if i am a fool or have done what my karma demands.

 1. is it true that they dream?  it is true, for the spaces of night surround them with shape and purpose, like a warm hollow below the shoulders, or between the curve of thigh and belly. the land itself can lie like this. hence our understanding of giants. the wind and the grass cry out to the arms of their sleep as the shore cries out, and buries its face in the bruised sea. we all have heard barns and fences splintering against the dark with a weight that is more than wood. the stars, too, bear witness. we can read their tails and claws as we would read the signs of our own dreams; a knot of sheets, scratches defining the edges of the body, the position of the legs upon waking. the cage and the forest are as helpless in the night as a pair of open hands holding rain.  2. do they dream of the past or of the future?  think of the way a woman who wanders the roads could step into an empty farmhouse one afternoon and find a basket of eggs, some unopened letters, the pillowcases embroidered with initials that once were hers. think of her happiness as she sleeps in the daylilies; the air is always heaviest at the start of dusk. cows, for example, find each part of themselves traveling at a different rate of speed. their bells call back to their burdened hearts the way a sparrow taunts an old hawk. as far as the badger and the owl are concerned, the past is a silver trout circling in the ice. each night he swims through their waking and makes his way back to the moon. clouds file through the dark like prisoners through an endless yard. deer are made visible by their hunger. i could also mention the hopes of common spiders: green thread sailing from an infinite spool, a web, a thin nest, a child dragging a white rope slowly through the sand.  3. do they dream of this world or of another?  the prairie lies open like a vacant eye, blind to everything but the wind. from the tall grass the sky is an industrious map that bursts with rivers and cities. a black hawk waltzes against his clumsy wings, the buzzards grow bored with the dead. a screendoor flapping idly on an august afternoon or a woman fanning herself in church; this is how the tails of snakes and cats keep time even in sleep. there are sudden flashes of light to account for. alligators, tormented by knots and vines, take these as a sign of grace. eagles find solace in the far glow of towns, in the small yellow bulb a child keeps by his bed. the lightning that scars the horizon of the meadow is carried in the desperate gaze of foxes. have other skies fallen into this sky? all the evidence seems to say so. conspiracy of air, conspiracy of ice, the silver trout is thirsty for morning, the prairie dog shivers with sweat. skeletons of gulls lie scattered on the dunes, their beaks still parted by whispering. these are the languages that fall beyond our hearing. imagine the way rain falls around a house at night, invisible to its sleepers. they do not dream of us.  4. how can we learn more?  this is all we will ever know.

 on a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago i came to a curve on a slope where a clear stream flowed down flashing across dark rocks through its own echoes that could neither be caught nor forgotten it was the turning of autumn and already the mornings were cold with ragged clouds in the hollows long after sunrise but the pasture sagging like a roof the glassy water and flickering yellow leaves in the few poplars and knotted plum trees were held up in a handful of sunlight that made the slates on the silent mill by the stream glisten white above their ruin and a few relics of the life before had been arranged in front of the open mill house to wait pale in the daylight out on the open mountain after whatever they had been made for was over the dew was drying on them and there were few who took that road who might buy one of them and take it away somewhere to be unusual to be the only one to become unknown a wooden bed stood there on rocks a cradle the color of dust a cracked oil jar iron pots wooden wheels iron wheels stone wheels the tall box of a clock and among them a ring of white stone the size of an embrace set into another of the same size an iron spike rising from the ring where the wooden handle had fitted that turned it in its days as a hand mill you could see if you looked closely that the top ring that turned in the other had been carved long before in the form of a fox lying nose in tail seeming to be asleep the features worn almost away where it had gone around and around grinding grain and salt to go into the dark and to go on and remember  * * *  what i thought i had left i kept finding again but when i went looking for what i thought i remembered as anyone could have foretold it was not there when i went away looking for what i had to do i found that i was living where i was a stranger but when i retraced my steps the familiar vision turned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places and the places where i had been a stranger appeared to me to be where i had been at home called by name and answering getting ready to go away and going away  * * *  every time they assembled and he spoke to them about waking there was an old man who stood listening and left before the others until one day the old man stayed and who are you he asked the old man and the old man answered i am not a man many lives ago i stood where you are standing and they assembled in front of me and i spoke to them about waking until one day one of them asked me when someone has wakened to what is really there is that person free of the chain of consequences and i answered yes and with that i turned into a fox and i have been a fox for five hundred lives and now i have come to ask you to say what will free me from the body of a fox please tell me when someone has wakened to what is really there is that person free of the chain of consequences and this time the answer was that person sees it as it is then the old man said thank you for waking me you have set me free of the body of the fox which you will find on the other side of the mountain i ask you to bury it please as one of your own that evening he announced a funeral service for one of them but they said nobody has died then he led them to the other side of the mountain and a cave where they found a fox’s body and he told them the story and they buried the fox as one of them but later one of them asked what if he had given the right answer every time  * * *  once again i was there and once again i was leaving and again it seemed as though nothing had changed even while it was all changing but this time was a time of ending this time the long marriage was over the orbits were flying apart it was autumn again sunlight tawny in the fields where the shadows each day grew longer and the still afternoons ripened the distance until the sun went down across the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees it was the time of year when i was born and that evening i went to see friends for the last time and i came back after midnight along the road white with the moon i was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me the wide silent valley full of silver light and there just at the corner of the land that i had come back to so many times and now was leaving at the foot of the wall built of pale stone i saw the body stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished i carried her home to bury her in the garden in the morning of the clear autumn that she had left and to stand afterward in the turning daylight  * * *  there are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags of dried irises knuckled into the hollows of moss and rubbly limestone on the waves of the low wall the ivy has climbed along them where the weasel ran the light has kindled to gold the late leaves of the cherry tree over the lane by the house chimney there is the roof and the window looking out over the garden summer and winter there is the field below the house there is the broad valley far below them all with the curves of the river a strand of sky threaded through it and the notes of bells rising out of it faint as smoke and there beyond the valley above the rim of the wall the line of mountains i recognize like a line of writing that has come back when i had thought it was forgotten

 i saw my mother standing there below me on the narrow bank just looking out over the river  looking at something just beyond the taut middle rope of the braided swirling currents  then she looked up quite suddenly to the far bank where the densely twined limbs of the cypress  twisted violently toward the storm-struck sky there are some things we know before we know  also some things we wish we would not ever know even if as children we already knew &amp; so  standing above her on that bridge that shuddered each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings  i knew i could never even fate willing ever get to her in time

 deep reaches of sleep until the unforeseen moment, like fugue, like petit mal, some kind of sign,  a touch from a joker’s finger, to let him know what’s right, what’s wrong with the dream-within-a-dream. a sudden, slight  shift in the order of things and all the past undone. he left what was left of himself in her care that night.   •   they went to the river and dropped their clothes on the bank. she struck out. he followed in the long, slow vee of her wake.  she could sound and surface, bringing back with her what other lovers had dumped: hotel bill, gimcrack ring, a four-square shot  from the photo booth. later, they dipped their bottles and drank. she looked at him and laughed. “you think you’re safe? you’re not.”  •   in this, her fool is deaf and dumb and twirling a pink parasol. in this he’s doing a chicken dance. he turns away and puckers up for a kiss.  he’s their stalker, familiar, spy, his slippy grin is all lipstick and green teeth. words to the wise, or coffin-laugh, or catcall.  in this, he watches from cover, maestro of the deadfall. he goose-steps them out of the tunnel of love and into the house of glass.

 shrugging shallowly down, burrowing in beneath the heaps of plumped cork- and sallow- brown leaf, beneath the oak and the brittle bean-  dripping locust and the still so innocent fruit trees—bare-boughed and newly blossoming—skinnily shadowing the frost-seared grasses, i and my  “now” [in this pictured perfect] four- year-old daughter, huddled, hidden, lie low. i remember hiding in the fort  too: bedtimes once how snug among books and the plush beasts we spoke the speech of angels. now the world is huge- ly hushed. the winter sky is hard, kiln-fired  blue. the cherry wood retouched with buds. and small, untimely flowers like blood-drops on the snow.   •   time lapsed. time dwelt. there was nothing apparently to those rumors of rescue or reprisals. absence only  emptied the mind. the fond heart felt light—likewise lifted right and justly up to praise the day as it was to high  heaven. you were a “find”: rare, rose- lipped, hennaed, ochred, kohled, long black- stockinged o like one of schiele’s urewig girls, flashing a shy semaphore—  spelling eloquently out the f- word, tenderly revisiting its history. lust—like love lost—was the catalyst: exquisitely expedient, unchanged.

 swans   the arc of the driveway is what’s left, where someone built a house and tended a lake to walk beside, discussing politics and how a tree moves in the wind. its music is a jetty drifting away from the boathouse whose rolled-shut metal door tricks visitors into thinking it holds a life raft.  the house drifts beyond its purpose, is demolished for a car park and picnics and returns in a special room, small, sturdy, becoming anonymous as its windows empty, enormous insects swanning around — they own the place — occasionally stunning themselves on the glass.   secretarial   the country, sometimes, still appears to ask to just be taken down, even by a tourist, on no one’s side, a tourist lost at home, blue book open, ticking off each task.  but when old colin, in pajamas, explained how i could evade the barbed and electric wire that fenced off fields and the bull let loose to scare the stranger off (i’d stopped to ask for directions), i was ready to wade through cowshit and knee-high grass to see if  the poet, long abroad, was written in the ruin’s native life.  colin stopped me then, leaning on the open door of the renault— noting first the english registration i’d parked outside his roadside bungalow, and said his father hated that his mother called him colin,  but he’s the one who stuck it out. no one, it seems he had to tell me this, no one belonging to them ever had to go over to england, a sally he follows up with a question  about where i live, before naming the man on whose land the castle rested: we do nothing, he says, but damage what we inherited,   bulldozing the medieval church and causing the collapse of the foxhole the settler and his family used, legend has it, to make, under a smoldering fire, their escape. this new heir has his eye on the castle, no doubt.  it will soon be more literature than history. we are not all the same, he said. i recall, at the edge of the clearing, the grant’s nice clause saying the poet had a right  to possess new areas discovered by his survey ... to belong, a moment’s authority is nothing.

 so i spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and i did in the morning as i was commanded. — ezekiel 24:18 she is approaching him, god, he sees her in his eye-edge, a tiny gold speck getting bigger, scintillating. her beauty lashes him with its sword — but she has heard all this before. she approaches him, the one who killed her, and she reeks of life. he waits for her to dissolve in him, but her grit encircles his teeth. he waits for her to become what he has made her, an angel, passionate and cold as the dawn, quietly encased in power, churning out neutral love and fastened to eternity, backwards and forwards all the days. but the world is tangled in her hair. she is getting closer and her gold beauty is greening, her face is turning furious, fury-like, her death opens around him and he feels a human fear. he cannot match her, she has the reins of creation in her slim white paws, he feels the world creeping away from him. he makes to shove her from heaven, let her slip and slumber through the world. but he cannot grip her. she gleams through him like heaven through a needle.   the stroll  god takes ezekiel for many walks. he talks about all the things he will do to the people, this and this and this, and then they will know who i am. one day they chance upon a valley of bones splintering and whitening in the sun. shall these bones live? these bones? oh lord. god flings sinew on the bones, liver, spleen, gristle. the bodies rise. rise without breath, wet clay glistens in the sun. he gives breath, as if an afterthought. ezekiel tries to see in their eyes, one at a time. the men not moving but lunging forward like warriors, eyes ice cold mud seen through mist, waiting for their souls to snap back in. they are bruised with an ache made not by the world. their forgotten stories rift their faces, their deaths now a hole they can walk through. home a space that closed after them, rinsed of the mourning that ran its course. they glimmer in new reality, still speechless, as if they were really the miracle ... but already god has taken ezekiel by the elbow.

 tulsidas, the poet, was wandering, deep in thought, by the ganges, in that lonely spot where they burn their dead. he found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband, gaily dressed as for a wedding. she rose as she saw him, bowed to him, and said, "permit me, master, with your blessing, to follow my husband to heaven." "why such hurry, my daughter?" asked tulsidas. "is not this earth also his who made heaven?" "for heaven i do not long," said the woman. "i want my husband." tulsidas smiled and said to her, "go back to your home, my child. before the month is over you will find your husband." the woman went back with glad hope. tulsidas came to her every day and gave her high thoughts to think, till her heart was filled to the brim with divine love. when the month was scarcely over, her neighbours came to her, asking, "woman, have you found your husband?" the widow smiled and said, "i have." eagerly they asked, "where is he?" "in my heart is my lord, one with me," said the woman.

 how vainly men themselves amaze to win the palm, the oak, or bays, and their uncessant labours see crown’d from some single herb or tree, whose short and narrow verged shade does prudently their toils upbraid; while all flow’rs and all trees do close to weave the garlands of repose.  fair quiet, have i found thee here, and innocence, thy sister dear! mistaken long, i sought you then in busy companies of men; your sacred plants, if here below, only among the plants will grow. society is all but rude, to this delicious solitude.  no white nor red was ever seen so am’rous as this lovely green. fond lovers, cruel as their flame, cut in these trees their mistress’ name; little, alas, they know or heed how far these beauties hers exceed! fair trees! wheres’e’er your barks i wound, no name shall but your own be found.  when we have run our passion’s heat, love hither makes his best retreat. the gods, that mortal beauty chase, still in a tree did end their race: apollo hunted daphne so, only that she might laurel grow; and pan did after syrinx speed, not as a nymph, but for a reed.  what wond’rous life in this i lead! ripe apples drop about my head; the luscious clusters of the vine upon my mouth do crush their wine; the nectarine and curious peach into my hands themselves do reach; stumbling on melons as i pass, ensnar’d with flow’rs, i fall on grass.  meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less, withdraws into its happiness; the mind, that ocean where each kind does straight its own resemblance find, yet it creates, transcending these, far other worlds, and other seas; annihilating all that’s made to a green thought in a green shade.  here at the fountain’s sliding foot, or at some fruit tree’s mossy root, casting the body’s vest aside, my soul into the boughs does glide; there like a bird it sits and sings, then whets, and combs its silver wings; and, till prepar’d for longer flight, waves in its plumes the various light.  such was that happy garden-state, while man there walk’d without a mate; after a place so pure and sweet, what other help could yet be meet! but ’twas beyond a mortal’s share to wander solitary there: two paradises ’twere in one to live in paradise alone.  how well the skillful gard’ner drew of flow’rs and herbs this dial new, where from above the milder sun does through a fragrant zodiac run; and as it works, th’ industrious bee computes its time as well as we. how could such sweet and wholesome hours be reckon’d but with herbs and flow’rs!

 evolution settles for a while on various stable balances. one is that some of the girls like cute boys and some like ugly older men and sometimes women. the difference between them is the ones who like older men were felt up   by their fathers or uncles or older brothers, or if he didn't  touch you, still you lived in his cauldron of curses and  urges which could be just as worse. they grow already old,  angry, and wise, they get rich, get mean, get theirs.   the untouched/uncursed others are happy never needing  to do much, and never do much more than good. they envy  their mean, rich, talented, drunk sisters. good girls drink milk  and make milk and know they've missed out and know they're   better off. they might dance and design but won't rip out lungs  for a flag. bad ones write books and slash red paint on canvas;  they've rage to vent, they've fault lines and will rip a toga off  a caesar and stab a goat for the ether. it's as simple as that.   either, deep in the dark of your history, someone showed you  that you could be used as a cash machine, as a popcorn popper,  as a rocket launch, as a coin-slot jackpot spunker, or they didn't  and you grew up unused and clueless. either you got a clue   and spiked lunch or you got zilch but no punch. and you  never knew. it's exactly not anyone's fault. if it happened  and you don't like older men that's just because you like  them so much you won't let yourself have one. if you did   everyone would see. then they would know what happened  a long time ago, with you and with that original him, whose eyes  you've been avoiding for decades gone forgotten. that's why  you date men smaller than you or not at all. or maybe you've   turned into a man. it isn't anyone's fault, it is just human  and it is what happens. or doesn't happen. that's that. any  questions? if you see a girl dressed to say no one tells me what to do, you know someone once told her what to do.

 at first you didn’t know me. i was a shape moving rapidly, nervous  at the edge of your vision. a flat, high voice, dark slash of hair across my cheekbone.  i made myself present, though never distinct. things i said that he repeated, a tone  you could hear, but never trace, in his voice. silence—followed by talk of other things.  when you would sit at your desk, i would creep near you like a question. a thought would scurry  across the front of your mind. i’d be there, ducking out of sight. you must have felt me  watching you, my small eyes fixed on your face, the smile you wondered at, on the lips only.  the voice on the phone, quick and full of business. all that you saw and heard and could not find  the center of, those days growing into years, growing inside of you, out of reach, now with you  forever, in your house, in your garden, in corridors of dream where i finally tell you my name.

 after pavese under the trellised arbor, and our supper’s over in the memory i’ve found myself inside.  l not speaking, and beside us the river sliding softly by. now the light will fade  to moonlit water. and in memory i work to make this lingering accurate and sweet.  white ouzo and her hand that lifts the grapes, first to her lips, then to mine. i may as well speak  to moonlight as to her. and the walls of bruges light up again, a costume jewelry pearl string.  her profile and her shawl hugged tight against the breeze in memory’s flammable celluloid—flaring  and gone, replaced by bread and grapes, a checkered tablecloth. the two chairs stare each other down,  empty now, upon which moonlight flickered all night. the bread and grapes drip mist as dawn  carves the morning with a chilly wind, slicing away both moon and fog. now someone  without a name appears—first the fevered hands, dustdevil quick, that grope for the food in vain.  then the pale light shows the open mouth and rippling throat, white face on black water,  sparrow-flock fast, its spiraling path. but the bread and grapes stay where they were,  their smell tormenting that famished ghost, helpless to even lick away the dew that gathers  on the grapes, blue fluted sides of the wineglasses. dawnlight, everything dripping wet, and the chairs  stare at each other, alone. sometimes on the riverbank you can sense an odor—of grapes, or sex, or memory.  it swirls through the moonlit grass. and now wakes someone always mute, someone without a body  weaving also through the half-lit grass. the hoarse wail of someone who cannot speak,  who reaches out but cannot touch the grass, and only the nostrils flare. now the dawn will break,  late autumn cold. to crave so endlessly the warmth— the blood-pulsing fingertip, the body to embrace,  the pungent smells commingling. to rise like breath and slither through the trees and tangle every branch  in this unappeasable longing, this endless lust for touch and smell which afflicts the dead.  the souls in the trees face the gathering light. other times, in the ground, the rain torments them.

 there’s a mystery by the river, in one of the cabins shuttered with planks, its lock twisted; a bunch of magazines flipped open, a body. a blanket stuffed with leaves or lengths of rope, an empty gin bottle. put down your newspaper. look out beyond the bluffs, a coal barge is passing, its deck nearly level with the water, where it comes back riding high. you start talking about nothing, or that famous party, where you went dressed as a river. they listen, the man beside you touching his odd face in the countertop, the woman stirring tonic in your glass. down the bar the talk’s divorce, the docks, the nets filling with branches and sour fish. listen, i knew a woman who’d poke a hole in an egg, suck it clean and fill the shell with gin, then walk around all day disgusting people until she was so drunk the globe of gin broke in her hand. she’d stay alone at night on the boat, come back looking for another egg. that appeals to you, rocking for hours carving at a hollow stone. or finding a trail by accident, walking the bluff’s face. you know, your friends complain. they say you give up only the vaguest news, and give a bakery as your phone. even your stories have no point, just lots of detail: the room was long and bright, small and close, angering gaston; they turned away to embrace him; she wore the color out of season, she wore hardly anything at all; nobody died; saturday. these disguises of omission. like forgetting to say obtuse when you talk about the sun, leaving off the buttons as you’re sewing up the coat. so, people take the little they know to make a marvelous stew; sometimes, it even resembles you. it’s not so much you cover your tracks, as that they bloom in such false directions. this way friends who awaken at night, beside you, awaken alone.

 good enough name for me, my father said the day i was born. don't see why she can't have it, too.  but the women said no. my mother first. then each aunt, pulling my pink blanket back patting the crop of thick curls tugging at my new toes touching my cheeks.  we won't have a girl named jack, my mother said.  and my father's sisters whispered, a boy named jack was bad enough. but only so my mother could hear. name a girl jack, my father said, and she can't help but grow up strong. raise her right, my father said, and she'll make that name her own. name a girl jack and people will look at her twice, my father said.  for no good reason but to ask if her parents were crazy, my mother said.  and back and forth it went until i was jackie and my father left the hospital mad.  my mother said to my aunts, hand me that pen, wrote jacqueline where it asked for a name. jacqueline, just in case someone thought to drop the ie.  jacqueline,  just in case i grew up and wanted something a little bit longer and further away from jack.

 when she rises in the morning i linger to watch her; she spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window and the sunbeams catch her glistening white on the shoulders, while down her sides the mellow golden shadow glows as she stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts sway like full-blown yellow gloire de dijon roses.  she drips herself with water, and her shoulders glisten as silver, they crumple up like wet and falling roses, and i listen for the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals. in the window full of sunlight concentrates her golden shadow fold on fold, until it glows as mellow as the glory roses.

 it must be troubling for the god who loves you to ponder how much happier you’d be today had you been able to glimpse your many futures. it must be painful for him to watch you on friday evenings driving home from the office, content with your week— three fine houses sold to deserving families— knowing as he does exactly what would have happened had you gone to your second choice for college, knowing the roommate you’d have been allotted whose ardent opinions on painting and music would have kindled in you a lifelong passion. a life thirty points above the life you’re living on any scale of satisfaction. and every point a thorn in the side of the god who loves you. you don’t want that, a large-souled man like you who tries to withhold from your wife the day’s disappointments so she can save her empathy for the children. and would you want this god to compare your wife with the woman you were destined to meet on the other campus? it hurts you to think of him ranking the conversation you’d have enjoyed over there higher in insight than the conversation you’re used to. and think how this loving god would feel knowing that the man next in line for your wife would have pleased her more than you ever will even on your best days, when you really try. can you sleep at night believing a god like that is pacing his cloudy bedroom, harassed by alternatives you’re spared by ignorance? the difference between what is and what could have been will remain alive for him even after you cease existing, after you catch a chill running out in the snow for the morning paper, losing eleven years that the god who loves you will feel compelled to imagine scene by scene unless you come to the rescue by imagining him no wiser than you are, no god at all, only a friend no closer than the actual friend you made at college, the one you haven’t written in months. sit down tonight and write him about the life you can talk about with a claim to authority, the life you’ve witnessed, which for all you know is the life you’ve chosen.

 lordship is the same activity whether performed by lord or lady. or a lord who happens to be a lady, all the source and all the faults.  a woman steadfast in looking is a callot, and any woman in the wrong place or outside of her proper location is, by definition, a foolish woman.  the harlot is talkative and wandering by the way, not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home, now abroad, now in the streets,  now lying in wait near the corners, her hair straying out of its wimple. the collar of her shift and robe pressed one upon the other.  she goes to the green to see to her geese, and trips to wrestling matches and taverns. the said margery left her home in the parish of bishopshill,  and went to a house, the which the witness does not remember, and stayed there from noon of that day until the darkness of night.  but a whip made of raw hippopotamus hide, trimmed like a corkscrew, and anon the creature was stabled in her wits as well as ever she was biforn,  and prayed her husband as so soon as he came to her that she might have the keys to her buttery to take her meat and drink.  he should never have my good will for to make my sister for to sell candle and mustard in framlyngham, or fill her shopping list with crossbows,  almonds, sugar and cloth. the captainess, the vowess, must use herself to work readily as other gentilwomen doon,  in the innermost part of her house, in a great chamber far from the road. so love your windows as little as you can, for we be, either of us, weary of other.

 for alvester james long after it was necessary, uncle vess ate the leavings off the hog, doused them with vinegar sauce. he ate chewy abominations. then came high pressure. then came the little pills. then came the doctor who stole vess’s second sight, the predication of pig’s blood every fourth sunday. then came the stillness of barn earth, no more trembling at his step. then came the end of the rib, but before his eyes clouded, uncle vess wrote down the gospel of barbecue.  chapter one: somebody got to die with something at some time or another.  chapter two: don’t ever trust white folk to cook your meat until it’s done to the bone.  chapter three: december is the best time for hog killing. the meat won’t spoil as quick. screams and blood freeze over before they hit the air.  chapter four, verse one: great grandma mandy used to say food you was whipped for tasted the best.  chapter four, verse two: old master knew to lock the ham bacon chops away quick or the slaves would rob him blind. he knew a padlock to the smokehouse was best to prevent stealing, but even the sorriest of slaves would risk a beating for a full belly. so christmas time he give his nasty leftovers to the well behaved. the head ears snout tail fatback chitlins feet ribs balls. he thought gratitude made a good seasoning.  chapter five: unclean means dirty means filthy means underwear worn too long in summertime heat. perfectly good food can’t be no sin. maybe the little bit of meat on ribs makes for lean eating. maybe the pink flesh is tasteless until you add onions garlic black pepper tomatoes soured apple cider but survival ain’t never been no crime against nature or maker. see, stay alive in the meantime, laugh a little harder. go on and gnaw that bone clean.

 my father had several times expressed a fear of being buried alive. i insisted that the doctor should do whatever was necessary. the doctor asked me to leave the room. when i came back, he was able to assure me that renoir was dead!  jean renoir it is not 1937 for long. a clump of ash trees and a walk down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up in a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while at their center the projectionist, jean renoir, on a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds, and turtles for the sleepy children. corks come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset and, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks  into the boathouse to the linens:at last, it is 1915! a bird screams over the lake, two bats flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp, interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over water the the acceptance of white tablecloths on the darkening shore of the lake. a torch is lit for its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects. this film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders, not music and algebra but a war and, then, yet another war. . .  but we begin with the captured officers digging a tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall. the boches observe the frenchmen working with their hoes as from the trousers of a boy dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure! the prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled with snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow while germans with rifles on a hill are unable to kill them, for they have escaped into switzerland with its feather-brushed trees  and patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village. isn’t this the ending of the film? no! i’m sorry but there is a single blossom on the geranium, and when it falls, captain de boeldieu dies, discovering his afterlife along a november road— he does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film suffers its true conclusion. the two men hiding in the marsh will escape across the border, only to be returned to the continuing war. this is why there is no importance to your version of the story. and there will be another war. and more horror for the geranium! so, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive a steamer trunk filled with women’s clothing, they will all perform in a revue: a chorus of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings, garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and large paper carnations riding up like epaulets  on their broad shoulders. these poignant inversions are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing, in this comedy, their national anthem! the russian prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their mysterious czarina; the men open it expecting vodka and sausages. the box is filled with straw and books on cooking, painting, and algebra. in disgust they burn these books—kiss good-bye the frontier  of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe! now, these officers who are escape artists are moved as an elite corps and north to wintersborn. later, they are taken to a damp limestone castle from which no one will escape. the commandant is the stoic aristocrat, rauffenstein, his head is in a brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon. i mean no disrespect, but the balding rauffenstein is an abject picture of suffering. his villa has but one flower, a tall laden geranium.  rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, boeldieu, are friends. both would know that to clear a monocle one uses spirits of vinegar. they stand confirmed in manner beside a squirrel cage. rauffenstein feels superior to the other two principals, the rich jew, rosenthal, and the charming emotional marechal. these two hide in the marsh while boeldieu dies of a bullet wound. only a king may kill a king! and rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim but missing the leg; he severed in three places boeldieu’s intestine!  the captain is given a room in the turret that holds the flowering geranium. now comes the oratio obliqua of the marksman, rauffenstein; the disfigured commandant is sincerely saddened at having killed the noble captain. but before the shooting and escape we sensed the captain’s sacrifice was not sacrifice, or suicide, but the grand escape—a country road into another landscape. . . there are bells tolling down in the village. rosenthal and marechal with ropes have dropped  past the castle’s battlements to the ground. they run away across snowy farmland. marechal’s teeth are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco. rosenthal and marechal are extremes who have strong feelings for each other. they are befriended by a german widow, ulsa, and her daughter, lotte; ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome jew. he promises to return for her when the war is over. he will lose both his legs at mégéglise. this is not known within the story, but he’ll bleed  to death beside a little bridge. he lived his illusion in the orient of delacroix, his servants were syrians and negroes. he loved the little ivory spoons that chinese women in the open markets use to bathe and freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out of huge clay bowls. . . in the boathouse the children sleep, while jean’s oldest cousin, drunken, falls out of a rowboat. the lone swimmer has joined renior on the raft. the film now reveals the first diversion as all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing several hundred wooden flutes, the noise is like women crying over the fresh mounds at verdun. this diversion is not illusion and as the boches collect the flutes, the drunken cousin tries to join renior on the raft. boeldieu flees to the heights of the castle, the second diversion! we hear:halt! halt! halt! a gunshot, and chowder with blood falls from boeldieu’s opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard.  there are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled courtyard floor. scissors cut the blue blossom from the geranium. boeldieu will die. . . dead, he awakens on a country road where, now a peasant, he walks a white horse under the looming, bare trees. rosenthal and marechal are watching as they hide in the dead marsh flowers of an early november. they are alive. they do not recognize their friend. renoir’s cousin, asking for more wine, climbing onto the raft, spills  everything, and the projector with its crude lamp sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake— its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere lost off a cable that frayed, whoever is alive inside the iron bell is experiencing an eternal falling through water without the promise of a bottom. . . it’s 1937, the children asleep in the boathouse are being aroused, they wake to a bat caught in the wall of linen, they think it’s their uncle still casting images of animals for them. . .

 as you told it to me — our clearest, most reflective conversations so often then and there, in the middle of the night, staring into the darkness from wherever the mind has perched in its wanderings — you left your mother and the home aide upstairs, and went down into your father’s basement workroom to look for the right size screws; in her own wanderings, she has tugged off the front door lock. paneled in warped wood and abandoned like a mine, you find the string for the light in the middle of the room, as he must have known how to find it in the dark, and again you see the pegboard walls covered with constellations of polishing tools, the larger buffers hooked onto the paneling like fuzzy planets, the smaller ones stuck in a lucite block he customized to hold them like the varied moons those hanging planets might need, or a miniature copse of fantastical trees. so, too, the see-through brick in which he drilled holes for the array of drill bits themselves, their swirled metal tops imitating a skyline of onion domes and tapered gothic towers. the room’s order had been disturbed by time, and the band saw, jigsaw, the sander, and free-standing machines, the sized wrenches, pliers, picks, awls, and extra parts still hanging in their packages, the staple gun, lamps, brushes, gooseneck magnifying glass, soldering wire, conversion charts, the hundreds of other disordered tools, they might have been words in an encyclopedia before you could read more than a few words, and for you they were part of your father’s speech, or maybe more like your mother’s now, jumbled, rarely creating a sentence. with these tools he had sculpted a perfect cluster of grapes, still on their vine and still with their leaves; a wave, and a school of dolphins breaching; a formal replica of the brooklyn bridge with all its cabling; a bouquet of flowers — surfaces so smooth and rounded, objects so like their living counterparts we had no choice but to understand the power of creation running through the mind then tools and hands like a current. you looked around for the right size screws and came upon a small box marked green permanent. and when you opened it you saw small tubes of paint, now just mud without his attention, you said, holding both the power of what we do, and the sadness that it has to end.

 i have a sister who takes care of animals, whose artistry is flesh and blood mixed in with a dream or more she tries to give her son. he cuts school and drinks with his friends in the scrub woods behind the school. he thinks he wants to be an architect; he thinks the poems he writes are portions of his unmixed spirit. his habits of mind aren’t settled, ossifying so slowly for many of us, we can’t know, and no one can tell him anything about cigarettes, bad drugs, his fragile mortal spiral.  he can’t cry anymore—it’s the wrong style of feeling—, and he only half knows that like his mother he will have to descend before he can break into nakedness, as if from the warmed surface of loam, from slug-soft matter that breathes or suppurates.  my nephew samuel has the same name as the son of the famous surgeon dr. gross, painted by the american realist thomas eakins. samuel chugs gin, takes his tokes, and helps his mother with preps— a betadine swabbing, “like a ritual,” out from the site of the incision. he confuses his mother. in this poem i want to try to stand at their shoulders in the clinic. i think i could come near to swooning from the obscene odor in the air, but i can try to imagine something beyond the surgery, the fur and the glistening blood, and i wouldn’t leave them.  —   the flight of gray gulls over the bay accompanied my early wrestling with flesh, “blue suede shoes” playing on the radio in my parents’ house. the fluency, then, of hands and lips threw seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant fluency when i was thirty.  then i believed in the beauty of helen and sometimes, as the fullest truth, in the colored clouds above apple trees full of blossoms and the reddened fruit afterwards. in the end, of course, the fruit turns to mash, and wasps burrow drunkenly in the meat no longer crisp.  —   there is a terrible beauty in the speeches of nestor after agamemnon has called out the spirit of his army by inviting them to go home. imagine the sober tones of the generals and the old king, his face a lifelong gallery of portraits, grizzled hair an aura, as he faces  them with his counsel. from his lips a kind of honey mixing with the bitterness of those two quarreling. he asks them for their mettle, earth born, and leans, foreshortened, his robe exposing a scarred and whitened chest.  a vignette of what we cannot learn, or outlast.  —   one who loves earth and the sun and animals stands over the necrotic thigh of a wolfhound with scapel and rongeur, a patina of antiseptic reddening the bare skin around the wound. the odors are a mixture of rotted flowers and fruit and the beautiful blood oozing from an incision above a honeycomb of maggots, swollen, moving. if you can bear to stand close and look closely at the dissection, you will feel your own stomach turn and your nerves grow a little cleaner, and you may feel puzzled how a person would want to know that much anatomy.  wasn’t it like this for michelangelo? this lesson of body? and the artist’s revulsion, someone trying to look beyond heroic contours of ruined flesh— softness of hip and buttocks—into the serum of spirit?  to live while another no longer can live. this flesh and that muscle, and tinted spring forests, and mausoleums.

 there are stones even here worn into a malevolence by time gritting the teeth and tearing the eyes with the memory.  out in the desert, the wind is a sculptor working the ephemera of sand. desperately editing steles to write the names of thousands of slaves who died to make pharaoh great. it is a fool’s game.  and we are like the blind musician at the hotel who tells us with a smile: i’ll see you later.  the guard at the pyramid eyes me. are you egyptian? he demands, then searches my bag for a bomb. at the hotel they speak arabic to me, don’t treat me like the white guests, and i guess, even here, with all the hindsight of history we haven’t learned to love ourselves.  i cannot crawl into the tombs, and cannot explain why. how do you say: in my country they buried me alive for six months? and so you lie and tell yourself this is love. i am protecting the world from my rage.  rabab tells me: we know how to build graves here. i nod. i know. it is the same all over africa.  do you have a knife? do you have one? the guards at the museum ask breyten and me, searching us. we call this on ourselves. we are clearly political criminals.  i trace the glyphs chipped into stone. as a writer i am drawn to this. if i could i too would carve myself into eternity. breyten watching me says: don’t tell me you’ve found a spelling mistake in it!  a line of miniature statues is placed into the tomb to serve the pharaoh. one for each day of the year. four hundred. the overseers are a plus. i think even death will not ease the lot of the poor here.  statues: it seems the more i search the world for differences the more i find it all the same. perhaps the buddha was a jaded traveler too when he said we are all one.  mona argues about who should pay to see the mummies. it isn’t often i can treat a girl to a dead body, breyten insists.  a woman nearby tells her husand she can see dead bodies at work. why pay? do you think she works in a hospital? i ask. that or the u.s. state department, breyten agrees.  from the top of bab zwelia, flat rooftops spread out like a conference of coffee tables. broken walls, furniture, pots, litter the roofs like family secrets sunning themselves. two white goats on a roof chew their way through the debris.  on the nile, rabab sings in arabic, tells me she wants to be celine dion. she is my sister calling me home to egypt. perhaps one day i will be ready. for now it is enough to know i can be at home here.

 when he was my age and i was already a boy my father made a machine in the garage. a wired piece of steel with many small and beautiful welds ground so smooth they resembled rows of pearls.  he went broke with whatever it was. he held it so carefully in his arms. he carried it foundry to foundry. i think it was his harp, i think it was what he longed to make with his hands for the world.  he moved it finally from the locked closet to the bedroom to the garage again where he hung it on the wall until i climbed and pulled it down and rubbed it clean and tried to make it work.

 when the wind turns and asks, in my father’s voice, have you prayed?  i know three things. one: i’m never finished answering to the dead.  two: a man is four winds and three fires. and the four winds are his father’s voice, his mother’s voice . . .  or maybe he’s seven winds and ten fires. and the fires are seeing, hearing, touching, dreaming, thinking . . . or is he the breath of god?  when the wind turns traveler and asks, in my father’s voice,have you prayed? i remember three things. one: a father’s love  is milk and sugar, two-thirds worry, two-thirds grief, and what’s left over  is trimmed and leavened to make the bread the dead and the living share.  and patience? that’s to endure the terrible leavening and kneading.  and wisdom? that’s my father’s face in sleep.  when the wind asks,have you prayed? i know it’s only me  reminding myself a flower is one station between earth’s wish and earth’s rapture, and blood  was fire, salt, and breath long before it quickened any wand or branch, any limb that woke speaking. it’s just me  in the gowns of the wind, or my father through me, asking, have you found your refuge yet? asking,are you happy?  strange. a troubled father. a happy son. the wind with a voice. and me talking to no one.  
NEW POEM
 we need the ceremony of one another, meals served , more love, more handling of one another with love, less casting out of those who are not of our own household.  ‘this turkey is either not cooked enough or it’s tough.’  the culture is in late imperial decline. the children don’t like dark meat or pepper. they say the mother sometimes deliberately puts pepper on the things the grown-ups like better.  less casting out of those in our own household with whom we disagree.  the cat will not hear of cat food, he waves it away. he has seen the big thrush taken from the cold box, dressed and put in the hot.  ‘if i set the alarm clock, will you turn on the oven when it goes off?’ then she went off to see the profane dancers of the afternoon. it was done.  the fact that i don’t like his pictures should not obscure the facts that he is a good man that many admire his work (his canvases threaten my existence and i hope mine his, the intolerant bastard) that we are brothers in humanity &amp; the art. often it does, though.  the cat has followed hazard from his studio, he looks mean. he upbraids the innocent dog and all of us, he casts us out.  ‘there’s pepper in this gravy. we’re supposed to eat dry turkey and you’ve put pepper in the gravy.’  the meal is served , nevertheless with felt love, some godless benediction.  the grown ones have wine after the other bottle. they cast out a lot. ‘the dancers this afternoon were, well, thinky ,’ she says. she toys with her glass.  ‘he is strictly a one-joke painter,’ he replies, ‘painted that one twenty years ago and is still putting pepper on it, ha hah. finish your turkey you two and leave a little gravy for someone else.’  the cat is taking notes against his own household. he watches. hazard would like once to see things with the cat’s eyes, flat.  now it is time to go to bed. hungry and alone most go to bed in this decline and in all others, yet  someone has fed us again and blessed us with the manners of bohemia. among barbarians, a lot is expected of us, ceremony-wise. we rise to that expectation.

 he thinks when we die we’ll go to china. think of it—a chinese heaven where, except for his blond hair, the part that belongs to his father, everyone will look like him. china, that blue flower on the map, bluer than the sea his hand must span like a bridge to reach it. an octave away.  i’ve never seen it. it’s as if i can’t sing that far. but look— on the map, this black dot. here is where we live, on the pancake plains just east of the rockies, on the other side of the clouds. a mile above the sea, the air is so thin, you can starve on it. no bamboo trees but the alpine equivalent, reedy aspen with light, fluttering leaves. did a boy in guangzhou dream of this as his last stop?  i’ve heard the trains at night whistling past our yards, what we’ve come to own, the broken fences, the whiny dog, the rattletrap cars. it’s still the wild west, mean and grubby, the shootouts and fistfights in the back alley. with my son the dreamer and my daughter, who is too young to walk, i’ve sat in this spot and wondered why here? why in this short life, this town, this creek they call a river?  he had never planned to stay, the boy who helped to build the railroads for a dollar a day. he had always meant to go back. when did he finally know that each mile of track led him further away, that he would die in his sleep, dispossessed, having seen gold mountain, the icy wind tunneling through it, these landlocked, makeshift ghost towns?  it must be in the blood, this notion of returning. it skipped two generations, lay fallow, the garden an unmarked grave. on a spring sweater day it’s as if we remember him. i call to the children. we can see the mountains shimmering blue above the air. if you look really hard says my son the dreamer, leaning out from the laundry’s rigging, the work shirts fluttering like sails, you can see all the way to heaven.

 it’s my favorite photo— captioned, “daddy and his sweetheart.” it’s in black and white, it’s before pabst blue ribbon, before his tongue became a knife that made my mother bleed, and before he blackened my eye the time he thought i meant to end my life.  he’s standing in our yard on porter road beneath the old chestnut tree. he’s wearing sunglasses, a light cotton shirt, and a dreamy expression.  he’s twenty-seven. i’m two. my hair, still baby curls, is being tossed by a gentle breeze. i’m fast asleep in his arms.  
NEW POEM
 here they are. the soft eyes open. if they have lived in a wood it is a wood. if they have lived on plains it is grass rolling under their feet forever.  having no souls, they have come, anyway, beyond their knowing. their instincts wholly bloom and they rise. the soft eyes open.  to match them, the landscape flowers, outdoing, desperately outdoing what is required: the richest wood, the deepest field.  for some of these, it could not be the place it is, without blood. these hunt, as they have done, but with claws and teeth grown perfect,  more deadly than they can believe. they stalk more silently, and crouch on the limbs of trees, and their descent upon the bright backs of their prey  may take years in a sovereign floating of joy. and those that are hunted know this as their life, their reward: to walk  under such trees in full knowledge of what is in glory above them, and to feel no fear, but acceptance, compliance. fulfilling themselves without pain  at the cycle’s center, they tremble, they walk under the tree, they fall, they are torn, they rise, they walk again.

 “the withness of the body” the heavy bear who goes with me, a manifold honey to smear his face, clumsy and lumbering here and there, the central ton of every place, the hungry beating brutish one in love with candy, anger, and sleep, crazy factotum, dishevelling all, climbs the building, kicks the football, boxes his brother in the hate-ridden city.  breathing at my side, that heavy animal, that heavy bear who sleeps with me, howls in his sleep for a world of sugar, a sweetness intimate as the water’s clasp, howls in his sleep because the tight-rope trembles and shows the darkness beneath. —the strutting show-off is terrified, dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his pants, trembles to think that his quivering meat must finally wince to nothing at all.  that inescapable animal walks with me, has followed me since the black womb held, moves where i move, distorting my gesture, a caricature, a swollen shadow, a stupid clown of the spirit’s motive, perplexes and affronts with his own darkness, the secret life of belly and bone, opaque, too near, my private, yet unknown, stretches to embrace the very dear with whom i would walk without him near, touches her grossly, although a word would bare my heart and make me clear, stumbles, flounders, and strives to be fed dragging me with him in his mouthing care, amid the hundred million of his kind, the scrimmage of appetite everywhere.

 every construction is temporary, including the fire altar. — roberto calasso accommodate the action in your life to wrest the deep perspective of the real from cubic content realms of atmosphere at play beyond the bank and shoal of time.  then resonance begins, and all vibrates. the syntax of position no more sculpts this world of interpenetrative forms than syntaxes of motion render grace.  yet syntax is the caul on all our births; and mothers claw the membrane from our eyes to fret us into life, in losing theirs. from there, each choice engraves a different choice.  the decades pass. one needle for one groove. the canticles flare chaos from the spin. the gyre to crackly zero stays the same. (you’ve got to love the hindus more than most.)  we saw grand sweeps of swells from tiny arcs. we sliced the wave face, tumbling into light. my mother hugged me good-bye at seventy-three, knowing, just then, her strength may outlive mine.  accommodate the action in your life, she said, to aeronautical exhausts of every plane and cab i ever caught (my own arcs more elaborate than most).  accommodate the action of your life, she seemed to say: make past and future fuse. i felt her fingers dig into my back: that strength i had is yours. things die. not love.

 because this evening miss hoang yen sat down with me in the small tiled room of her family house i am unable to sleep. we shared a glass of cold and sweet water. on a blue plate her mother brought us cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me but i did not feel strange in the house my country had tried to bomb into dust. in english thick and dazed as blood she told me how she watched our planes cross her childhood’s sky, all the children of hanoi carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, nixon’s christmas bombing. she let me hold her hand, her shy unmoving fingers, and told me how afraid she was those days and how this fear had dug inside her like a worm and lives inside her still, won’t die or go away. and because she’s stronger, she comforted me, said i’m not to blame, the million sorrows alive in her gaze. with the dead we share no common rooms. with the frightened we can’t think straight; no words can bring the burning city back. outside on hung dao street i tried to say good-bye and held her hand too long so she looked back through traffic towards her house and with her eyes she told me i should leave. all night i ached for her and for myself and nothing i could think or pray would make it stop. some birds sang morning home across the lake. in small reed boats the lotus gatherers sailed out among their resuming white blossoms.  hanoi, 1990

 remember me: the murmuring lips half said in half-light, buried in the hollow a boy’s neck made, as now inside his head they stir again, though twenty years swallow the purest parts of her, all but her plea, this taunt—what act from him could it command? the boy who’d know is gone—re-member me— but what man can assemble limbs, make stand again those legs that twined in his, or hitch the yoke of hips to sway and resurrect a girl? i try, but only recollect her scar—each lewd, profaning, cautered stitch— vermiform, red, furrowed belly to breast: where nights, long past, he’d laid his head in rest.

 p art o ne   the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees. the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas. the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, and the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.  he’d a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, a coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. they fitted with never a wrinkle. his boots were up to the thigh. and he rode with a jewelled twinkle, his pistol butts a-twinkle, his rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard. he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred. he whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.  and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked where tim the ostler listened. his face was white and peaked. his eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay, but he loved the landlord’s daughter, the landlord’s red-lipped daughter. dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—  “one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i’m after a prize to-night, but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day, then look for me by moonlight, watch for me by moonlight, i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”  he rose upright in the stirrups. he scarce could reach her hand, but she loosened her hair in the casement. his face burnt like a brand as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; and he kissed its waves in the moonlight, (o, sweet black waves in the moonlight!) then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.  p art t wo   he did not come in the dawning. he did not come at noon; and out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon, when the road was a gypsy’s ribbon, looping the purple moor, a red-coat troop came marching— marching—marching— king george’s men came marching, up to the old inn-door.  they said no word to the landlord. they drank his ale instead. but they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow bed. two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! there was death at every window; and hell at one dark window; for bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.  they had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest. they had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her breast! “now, keep good watch!” and they kissed her. she heard the doomed man say— look for me by moonlight; watch for me by moonlight; i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!  she twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! they stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years till, now, on the stroke of midnight, cold, on the stroke of midnight, the tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!  the tip of one finger touched it. she strove no more for the rest. up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her breast. she would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; for the road lay bare in the moonlight; blank and bare in the moonlight; and the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love’s refrain.  tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horsehoofs ringing clear; tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding— riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still.  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence!tlot-tlot, in the echoing night! nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned. he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood! not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear how bess, the landlord’s daughter, the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat; when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  .       .       .  and still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, a highwayman comes riding— riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred. he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

 he’ll have been the last of his kind here then. the flagstones, dry-stone walls, the slumping thatch, out-offices and cow cabins, the patch of haggard he sowed spuds and onions in— all of it a century out of fashion— all giving way to the quiet rising damp of hush and vacancy once he is gone. those long contemplations at the fire, cats curling at the door, the dog’s lame waltzing, the kettle, the candle and the lamp— all still, all quenched, all darkened— the votives and rosaries and novenas, the pope and kennedy and sacred heart, the bucket, the basket, the latch and lock, the tractor that took him into town and back for the pension cheque and messages and pub, the chair, the bedstead and the chamber pot, everything will amount to nothing much. everything will slowly disappear. and some grandniece, a sister’s daughter’s daughter, one blue august in ten or fifteen years will marry well and will inherit it: the cottage ruins, the brown abandoned land. they’ll come to see it in a hired car. the kindly liverpudlian she’s wed, in concert with a local auctioneer, will post a sign to offer site for sale. the acres that he labored in will merge with a neighbor’s growing pasturage and all the decades of him will begin to blur, easing, as the far fields of his holding did, up the hill, over the cliff, into the sea.

 ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep during the summers. we played in the water and dirt, then inscribed abcs and numbers onto the smooth ground. our cat polly died of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage as they thrashed in panic. there was a pink bruise on my forehead from pressing against the wall. we couldn't figure  out how such a thing could happen. the dogs were steadfast figures around the farm. they chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep panic among visitors and passersby. they had cuts and bruises from scuffles with roaming packs. no tags were inscribed with their random navajo names. snazzy was skinny; his rib cage obvious through thin fur. he looked as if he might die  from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. who knew he would die of rabies with the rest? the main thing was to figure out how they contracted it, my parents said. we cried until our rib cages ached; our eyes stayed swollen. this first loss was too deep to even talk about. decades later, i can finally describe how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise  that would last forever. but our neighbor suffered worse bruises: their huge dog, named dog, was the first to die and was the cause of all this. their home and fields are inscribed in our memories as "the rabies place." over time, they must have figured it was too much to live down. childhood losses run deep, even though we are grandparents now. the memory is an invisible cage  of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages exploding. sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. that initial deep hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, "let god's scribe  mark this down. we've paid our dues. our hearts are inscribed with loss after loss." for some reason, after everything, our rib cages held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. they must have figured that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises that would weaken us. our love for those homely animals was deep  and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. one can die from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the holy twins.

 they are all gone away, the house is shut and still, there is nothing more to say.  through broken walls and gray the winds blow bleak and shrill: they are all gone away.  nor is there one to-day to speak them good or ill: there is nothing more to say.  why is it then we stray around the sunken sill? they are all gone away,  and our poor fancy-play for them is wasted skill: there is nothing more to say.  there is ruin and decay in the house on the hill: they are all gone away, there is nothing more to say.

 here is the house to hold me — cradle of all the race; here is my lord and my love, here are my children dear — here is the house enclosing, the dear-loved dwelling place; why should i ever weary for aught that i find not here?  here for the hours of the day and the hours of the night; bound with the bands of duty, rivetted tight; duty older than adam — duty that saw acceptance utter and hopeless in the eyes of the serving squaw.  food and the serving of food — that is my daylong care; what and when we shall eat, what and how we shall wear; soiling and cleaning of things — that is my task in the main — soil them and clean them and soil them — soil them and clean them again.  to work at my trade by the dozen and never a trade to know; to plan like a chinese puzzle — fitting and changing so; to think of a thousand details, each in a thousand ways; for my own immediate people and a possible love and praise.  my mind is trodden in circles, tiresome, narrow and hard, useful, commonplace, private — simply a small back-yard; and i the mother of nations! — blind their struggle and vain! — i cover the earth with my children — each with a housewife's brain.

 though half my years besiege the aged sun, i have not lived. my robust preparation lags tardily behind fit consummation, droops sweatily in courses just begun.  oh, i have loved and lusted with the best, plucked momentary music from the senses; i’ve kissed a lip or two with fair pretenses and wept for softness of a woman’s breast.  my mind rebounds to nether joys and pain, toying with filth and pharisaic leaven; i know the lift up sundry peaks to heaven, and every rockless path to hell again.  i wait the hour when gods have more to give than husks and bare insatiate will to live.

 sometimes we blubbered through the fallout of willful confusion in pants that didn’t fit the legs we sawed off. we looked at each other and fell forward and back, forward and back, a little bit like dancing and a little like aggravated assault. at times it seemed reasonable because it always seems reasonable to accept whatever anxieties or losses must accumulate in the face of what we really wanted all along. in buildings and on streets you could paint a few eyes on a face and see the careless representation of brothers and sisters making a family out of paint and the gracious mistakes of seeing. mistakes, the essence of sight, could have been all we had to go on anyway, and not for us to leave behind what took us through the shower of dumbasses with tact and a breath of elegance, even the hope that later, when the streets cleared of agitated needlers and the ac kicked on for good, we could sleep on the clothes spangled outside the closet and find a reason for closing the bedroom door on shadows of pedantic radiation from thin margins of lamplight always suggesting some other plot in some other bedroom, tensions to splay us soon enough. and then it occurred to you, or maybe it occurred to me, doesn’t matter, i think actually someone called and said that anyone who doesn’t leave something for you isn’t worth having, so maybe now's a good time to find a dapper little high school where everyone can be a little less civil, and blessed with selfishness, we could part the fingers interlocked between us, make fists and get busy. then intensity fermented into green books of music, loud country music, and i love country music. it rolled around my ears in corridors where boredom had once been so irrefutable and heavy, and i was happy and dancing and throwing punches at pigeons and even hitting a few. but the romantic arc never made it over the willful lack of conviction, some gap between the faces on the heads we saw pass our table in the sour-faced restaurant run by those french people, okay a gap between that and the face in the dream you had of your father, the one where you said he stuffed a billy club down a duck’s throat and called for another shot of dewar’s. i expected you to take things when you left, but not those things. light diffuses evenly across the kitchen, blood through my body, and it’s sort of funny, but our whole thing fits between two haircuts, like a roadtrip or something. i feel now that i’ve been digested by time, and light would pool into terrible reflections of my own back as i backed into a mirror or performed some other forgetful jujitsu, an effort to lose thoughts or patterns of thought, but the light diffuses and you walk through it, collide with little pieces of what ate you, get angry and write long letters about how your hand can’t talk, how the paper is so light and effortless when you hold it how could you even know, you couldn’t even imagine holding this light and ridiculous thing that my hand brushed over in patterns it will later try to forget. then i taped my mouth shut and tried to whistle. leave me alone. don’t call. get lost, dumpster of confusion. i know it’s never been that easy, that from the eyes in your skull the black plastic bags were suffocating the trees even though to me it was more like a ballerina’s shadow had escaped and was dancing through the branches frantically with desperate happiness and cause for alarm. i guess either way something unsafe and ridiculous was happening, and i guess we knew it, i think we even talked about it, but i’ve been a little lonely since i started writing my dissertation. it’s about class consciousness among people who work behind registers. and it’s interesting, there’s all kinds of different races and classes and income levels represented in the world of cashiers, but at the level of values we see predominantly two classes, the complacent and the entitled, though many cashiers are some measure of both. the complacent are resigned to what they understand to be their position. they’re courteous and reliable; class issues only arise when people are rude to them, which they tend to handle fine, though if they say anything about it afterwards, it tends to be a cruel and brief dismissal not only of the occurrence, but of the entire offending person. the entitled have a very complicated expression of social hierarchy. because they see themselves in transition, usually ascending, there’s this idea that their values won’t, or can’t, find full expression from their current position and so they don’t feel compelled to act in a way consistent with their values, while at the same time they may expect to be treated in accordance with those values. when people are rude to them, they flip out. basically today’s been pasted together from the leavings of some green intensity and cigarettes crowded at the back of the passive classrooms of the skull. will there be coffee on the other side? will there be ladies to walk up to you on a plain old shit-for-brains day and ask you of washington square park, “why is this on the map?” i like it when people cock their heads a little when you talk. seems elegant. i tell them i’m not sure, but henry james wrote something complicated about it. then these nice ladies with a telling lack of accent move along into non-history and the bulk of our hours waiting without a mind for restitution. i would surrender our moist telephone calls and arthritic tribes of entitlement if i knew who to give them up to. i never go anywhere or do anything slow because revision is only a function of doubt. well okay, maybe doubt and shame. actually, it’s just shame. revision is a function of shame. but enough of these dead people, we must rise like blood in april! instead here i am peeling seconds off the end of my life, glass of water, frown on face, notebook open to the parade of minutes and obvious as a daisycutter in the desert. no more nights in the kitchen or bowls of macaroni, no more misdemeanors with the microwave or blue orbs whistling into my ear, no more cats meowing at the television, no cigarettes on the patio, no more blessings in drag. my schedule is totally blank this afternoon.  
NEW POEM
 i don’t understand why everyone stares when i take off my clothes and dance down the stairs. or when i stick carrots in both of my ears, then dye my hair green and go shopping at sears. i just love to dress up and do goofy things. if i were an angel, i’d tie-dye my wings!  why can’t folks accept me the way that i am? so what if i’m different and don’t act like them? i’m not going to change and be someone i’m not. i like who i am, and i’m all that i’ve got.  
NEW POEM
 i’m gently rowing and the birds look sewn to the surface of the water as it undulates to the sound of sean talking beautifully about something i don’t really understand. but all i’m picturing are brown paper bags with little grease spots near the bottom seams that have recorded the way sausage rolls have touched them, or the thin waists of dogs as depicted in medieval hunting frescos, or a cherub’s fat little hand gesturing to a vista where smiling families are meeting to picnic with the animals that god has also saved, or i’m thinking about the mechanics of bagpipes, the legs and arms and the fat belly and the long neck with its holes. this has been the best day ever. sean smiles. he’s wearing shorts, and so am i. it’s sunny! mine are so short they may as well be underpants, and i still don’t understand a word that he is saying.

 white horses, tails high, rise from the cedar. smoke brings the fat crickets, trembling breeze. find that holy place, a promise. embers glow like moon air.  i call you back from the grasses. wake me when sand pipers fly. they fade, and new sounds flutter. cattails at sunrise. hair matted by sleep.  sun on the meadow. grey boughs lie tangled. the ground i was born to wants me to leave. i’ve searched everywhere to tell you my eyes are with the hazels.  wind swells through fences, drones a flat ache for hours. at night, music would echo from your womanless bedroom. far down those bleaching cliffs, roses shed a torrent.  will you brush my ear? an ice bear sometimes lumbers west. your life still gleams, the edge melting. i never let you know. you showed me and how under snow and darkness, the grasses breathe for miles.

 they say you are made of clouds, they say you are made of feathers, they say you are everywhere or nowhere—we know you are both. our flight is delayed, this airport another nowhere.if this is your final destination, the air murmurs,if a stranger or anyone you do not know well offers you anything... but how well &amp; what's he offering &amp; is this our final destination? at the hotel a man hands us the key to room three one three—home for a week or so. on the lobby tv a woman once apparently enormous holds her old jeans up to her body &amp; smiles. neil diamond sings &amp; when i go in- to the bathroom he follows.everybody has one. paradise is cloudless, they say, impossible to know. yesterday a man was sucked into the earth as he slept—a sinkhole opened below his bed—not even his brother could save him. in the hotel restaurant my daughter orders corn flakes, they come with a pitcher of milk, she pours nearly all of it into her bowl, until i stop her she will keep on pouring. three more tvs are screwed into the wall above us—a car goes round &amp; round, a pitcher throws a baseball, a woman slams her racket to the clay. my daughter pushes her bowl away, picks two packets of jelly from the basket, pulls the plastic off one, then the other, lifts each to her tongue—red, then purple. the wallpaper is the texture of trees, a landscape seen from above, a contour map of an unnamed mountain, people wandering the face of it. if we were closer we could tell river from leaf, mountain from shadow, a fire making, unmaking itself. what is this strand of dna between us, unconnected to &amp; of the shadows parading past, our outlines already chalked into the earth? i live on air &amp; light, i drag my daughter everywhere, this morning she muttered federer federer federer like a spell &amp; it was as if he stood before us again, his perfect red jersey. how many mornings, the sun not yet up, did i swivel on the red stool at the supermarket lunch counter, my mother in back extruding donuts, the aisles dark &amp; empty behind us—she'd bundled me into the car still sleeping to get there. i'd twirl or wander or make toast, contemplating the basket of butter &amp; jelly, each in its little wasteful tub, impervious to air or time or decay.angel of grape, your purple body not only filled those coffins but took the shape of those coffins—emptiness made whole, color now a shape.angel, my daughter now wants only you, she asks for the whole basket, she pulls back each sheet, puts her tongue in— strawberry is her favorite, because it tastes like strawberry.

 the sniper at work over the street corner acts. two girls, breathless after the dash across, radiate heat and bouquets, as when ironing silken delicates. with one, in place of a chignon, goosefleshed christmas wheat. she explodes, rages, curses the sniper; at the window, seemingly, i'm watching a beautiful storm. from the other, words like a sun-umbrella's flutterings, in the morning, on an adriatic beach. now and again, she flicks her head back: just for us. as she well knows: flicked hair sweetens the air. beauty, always forthcoming, never misses a half-smile. as they well know: making us happy costs them nothing. those half-smiles saying you aren't just one fact among others—not at all, not for them—even banishing the hex of that fact if any other woman's glacial look had magicked it up. the air smelt strongly of my distant youth when every boulevard led to the end of the world, when life was not yet "threadbare as a proverb." now they're going, leaving such tenderness in me as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens into which snowflakes are swarming. so they disappeared chattering, not girls but breezes, blown lightly, surprisingly, through the st. john's heat of siege. the st. john's heat of being.

 for example, with someone who no longer is, who exists only in yellowed letters.  or long walks beside a stream, whose depths hold hidden  porcelain cups—and the talks about philosophy with a timid student or the postman.  a passerby with proud eyes whom you'll never know.  friendship with this world, ever more perfect (if not for the salty smell of blood).  the old man sipping coffee in st.-lazare, who reminds you of someone.  faces flashing by in local trains—  the happy faces of travelers headed perhaps for a splendid ball, or a beheading.  and friendship with yourself —since after all you don't know who you are.

 to lady winchelsea, occasioned by four satirical verses on women wits, in the rape of the lock  in vain you boast poetic names of yore, and cite those sapphos we admire no more: fate doomed the fall of every female wit; but doomed it then, when first ardelia writ. of all examples by the world confessed, i knew ardelia could not quote the best; who, like her mistress on britannia’s throne, fights and subdues in quarrels not her own. to write their praise you but in vain essay; even while you write, you take that praise away. light to the stars the sun does thus restore, but shines himself till they are seen no more.

 in a landscape of having to repeat. noticing that she does, that he does and so on. the underlying cause is as absent as rain. yet one remembers rain even in its absence and an attendant quiet. if illusion descends or the very word you’ve been looking for. he remembers looking at the photograph, green and gray squares, undefined. how perfectly ordinary someone says looking at the same thing or i’d like to get to the bottom of that one. when it is raining it is raining for all time and then it isn’t and when she looked at him, as he remembers it, the landscape moved closer than ever and she did and now he can hardly remember what it was like.

 wisdom and valour, faith, justice,—the lofty names of virtue’s quest and prize,— what is each but a cold wraith until it lives in a man and looks thro’ a man’s eyes?  on chivalry as i muse, the spirit so high and clear it cannot soil with aught it meets of foul misuse; it turns wherever burns the flame of a brave thought;  and wheresoever the moan of the helpless and betrayed calls, from near or far, it replies as to its own need, and is armed and goes straight to its sure pole—star;—  no legendary knight renowned in an ancient cause i warm my thought upon. there comes to the mind’s sight one whom i knew, whose hand grasped mine: george calderon.  him now as of old i see carrying his head with an air courteous and virile, with the charm of a nature free, daring, resourceful, prompt, in his frank and witty smile.  by oxford towers and streams who shone among us all in body and brain so bold? who shaped so firm his themes crystal—hard in debate? and who hid a heart less cold?  lover of strange tongues, whether in snowy russia, or tropic island bowers listening to the songs of the soft—eyed islanders, crowned with tahitian flowers,  a maker of friends he went. yet who divined him wholly or his secret chivalries?— was all that accomplishment, wit, alertness, grace, but a kind of blithe disguise?  restless in curious thought and subtle exploring mind, he mixt his modern vein with a strain remotely brought from an older blood than ours, proud loyalties of spain.  was it the soul of a sword? for a bright sword leapt from sheath upon that august day when war’s full thunder stored over europe, suddenly crashed, and a choice upon each man lay.  others had left their youth in the taming years; and some doubted; some made moan. to meet the peril of truth with aught but a gay courage was not for calderon.  wounded from france he came. his spirit halted not; in that long battle afar, fruitless in all but fame, athos and ida saw where sank his gallant star.  o well could i set my mood to a mournful falling measure for a friend dear and dead! and well could memory brood singing of youth’s delight and lost adventure fled.  but that so fearless friend with his victorious smile my mourning mood has chid. he went to the very end; he counted not the cost; what he believed, he did.

 my eyes are polished smooth by sight, they clot like crystals in storm glass, like my sister brewing beakers of toxin. if we had seen what had been done, what the helicopter pilot did in our name,  what the special ops team did in our name, what they did with their hands in our name. what if it were my sister, what if it were her, what? if we had seen with our own smooth eyes.  mark the diacritical, my lovely: we’re all wearing our knee-high boots, every last one of us, we live in a booted nation. a nation girded and gunning. this moment, this is precisely all, watching takes work, sight takes hours,  takes my eyeglasses, every last one of them, as if they were yours. you can see there’s a sigh in our sight. what if it were my sister? what if it were, what. what we saw ground into our eyes with the photos,  with the newspaper reports. what would i say, what can i say if, what would i say if it were my sister, my own? with my own beakers of toxin, my own boots, my own hands in my own name?

 outside the house the wind is howling and the trees are creaking horribly. this is an old story with its old beginning, as i lay me down to sleep. but when i wake up, sunlight has taken over the room. you have already made the coffee and the radio brings us music from a confident age. in the paper bad news is set in distant places. whatever was bound to happen in my story did not happen. but i know there are rules that cannot be broken. perhaps a name was changed. a small mistake. perhaps a woman i do not know is facing the day with the heavy heart that, by all rights, should have been mine.

 i had eight birds hatcht in one nest, four cocks were there, and hens the rest. i nurst them up with pain and care, no cost nor labour did i spare till at the last they felt their wing, mounted the trees and learned to sing. chief of the brood then took his flight to regions far and left me quite. my mournful chirps i after send till he return, or i do end. leave not thy nest, thy dame and sire, fly back and sing amidst this quire. my second bird did take her flight and with her mate flew out of sight. southward they both their course did bend, and seasons twain they there did spend, till after blown by southern gales they norward steer’d with filled sails. a prettier bird was no where seen, along the beach, among the treen. i have a third of colour white on whom i plac’d no small delight, coupled with mate loving and true, hath also bid her dame adieu. and where aurora first appears, she now hath percht to spend her years. one to the academy flew to chat among that learned crew. ambition moves still in his breast that he might chant above the rest, striving for more than to do well, that nightingales he might excell. my fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone, is ‘mongst the shrubs and bushes flown and as his wings increase in strength on higher boughs he’ll perch at length. my other three still with me nest until they’re grown, then as the rest, or here or there, they’ll take their flight, as is ordain’d, so shall they light. if birds could weep, then would my tears let others know what are my fears lest this my brood some harm should catch and be surpris’d for want of watch whilst pecking corn and void of care they fall un’wares in fowler’s snare; or whilst on trees they sit and sing some untoward boy at them do fling, or whilst allur’d with bell and glass the net be spread and caught, alas; or lest by lime-twigs they be foil’d; or by some greedy hawks be spoil’d. o would, my young, ye saw my breast and knew what thoughts there sadly rest. great was my pain when i you bred, great was my care when i you fed. long did i keep you soft and warm and with my wings kept off all harm. my cares are more, and fears, than ever, my throbs such now as ‘fore were never. alas, my birds, you wisdom want of perils you are ignorant. oft times in grass, on trees, in flight, sore accidents on you may light. o to your safety have an eye, so happy may you live and die. mean while, my days in tunes i’ll spend till my weak lays with me shall end. in shady woods i’ll sit and sing and things that past, to mind i’ll bring. once young and pleasant, as are you, but former toys (no joys) adieu! my age i will not once lament but sing, my time so near is spent, and from the top bough take my flight into a country beyond sight where old ones instantly grow young and there with seraphims set song. no seasons cold, nor storms they see but spring lasts to eternity. when each of you shall in your nest among your young ones take your rest, in chirping languages oft them tell you had a dame that lov’d you well, that did what could be done for young and nurst you up till you were strong and ‘fore she once would let you fly she shew'd you joy and misery, taught what was good, and what was ill, what would save life, and what would kill. thus gone, amongst you i may live, and dead, yet speak and counsel give. farewell, my birds, farewell, adieu, i happy am, if well with you.

 my wife’s bare footprints on these rocks after she’s been swimming where the river has dug a small pool by the road outside bearsville  it looks like rain    no    it’s raining    should i follow these delicate marks to find her no    she’s just ten feet away    and she turns  back    green bathing suit    thin legs    orange and black towel    it stops raining    her footprints going away have evaporated  but of course she makes new ones heading toward me    there are certain moments you stay in even as they’re gone    like wet prints on rock or the way you cannot forget your dead friends

 house of five fires, you never raised me. those nights when the throat of the furnace wheezed and rattled its regular death, i wanted your wide door,  your mottled air of bark and working sunlight, wanted your smokehole with its stars, and your roof curving its singing mouth above me. here are the tiers once filled with sleepers,  and their low laughter measured harmony or strife. here i could wake amazed at winter, my breath in the draft a chain of violets. the house i left as a child now seems  a shell of sobs. each year i dream it sinister and dig in my heels to keep out the intruder banging at the back door. my eyes burn from cat urine under the basement stairs  and the hall reveals a nameless hunger, as if without a history, i should always walk the cluttered streets of this hapless continent. thinking it best i be wanderer,  i rode whatever river, ignoring every zigzag, every spin. i’ve been a fragment, less than my name, shaking in a solitary landscape, like the last burnt leaf on an oak.  what autumn wind told me you’d be waiting? house of five fires, they take you for a tomb, but i know better. when desolation comes, i’ll hide your ridgepole in my spine  and melt into crow call, reminding my children that spiders near your door joined all the reddening blades of grass without oil, hasp or uranium.  
NEW POEM
 at four o’clock it’s dark. today, looking out through dusk at three gray women in stretch slacks chatting in front of the post office, their steps left and right and back like some quick folk dance of kindness, i remembered the winter we spent crying in each other’s laps. what could you be thinking at this moment? how lovely and strange the gangly spines of trees against a thickening sky as you drive from the library humming off-key? or are you smiling at an idea met in a book the way you smiled with your whole body the first night we talked? i was so sure my love of you was perfect, and the light today reminded me of the winter you drove home each day in the dark at four o’clock and would come into my study to kiss me despite mistake after mistake after mistake.

 not yet summer, but unseasonable heat pries open the cherry tree.  it stands there stupefied, in its sham, pink frills, dense with early blooming.  then, as afternoon cools into more furtive winds, i look up to see a blizzard of petals rushing the sky.  it is only april. i can’t stop my own life from hurrying by. the moon, already pacing.

 there she was standing over me. she inched her face close to my face. she put her hands on my face. i remembered her immediately, but did not speak. my eyes blurred. they were hot and heavy. it hurt to look at ain’t sally. it hurt to see. i closed my eyes. i felt her cool touch. she chanted. “you will be well. you will not die.chim chukma taha che. you will be well.chi pesa taha che.” she sang to me. then i heard her leave.  a woman whose bed was surrounded by white partitions, moaned again. this was not a new sound. it was a constant. her breath whistled irregularly. there was no escaping the whistle. the whistling sounds were everywhere in the white room. then they stopped. another woman in another bed called out. no answer. she pushed the bell. women wearing white dresses came into the room. they pushed the partitions back. they said the whistling woman was dead. i went back to sleep. before the hospital. before rheumatic fever. before the dead woman. i had met ain’t sally. i was seven years old.  ain’t sally was an ancient indian relative who lived in hayrick, outside of dublin. a place of the snakes. a place of memory. once a base camp for nomadic tribes following buffalo, once a county seat, hayrick, texas took its name from a solitary mountain standing in the breadth of open grasslands. only a state government road sign remains, marking the place of hayrick. marking the sign of the snakes. the only time we visited ain’t sally, i rode in the back seat of our green 1950 chevrolet, and listened to my indian grandmother tell stories about our family. chapters went like this: —life in a  dugout. —making lye soap. —how grandfather got vd. i don’t remember much of the drive to hayrick. we drove the rural roads of west texas. there were two lanes of dust and dirt, stagnant, green-belted river beds and one-lane bridges. when we arrived at ain’t sally’s the old woman ambled out of a rusted screen door of a paintless wooden house. breasts sagging, her thin body lacking in strength seemed unable to support her weight. she wore a sleeveless dress that revealed naked brown skin, skin that was no more than a sheath for aging bones. hairless underarms. she fed us saltine crackers and cold squirrel dumplings. she asked me questions. she asked me about my secrets. i don’t remember having any to tell. she told me hers while i ate. she said i reminded her of someone she’d seen a long time ago. i remember dancing for her. i told her i was a bird. a manbird. a hunter. i danced around the kitchen table and sang and pretended to be powwow dancer. a bird of dance. a bird of rhythm.  when my mother and grandmother went to town, ain’t sally took me for a walk around her place. the farm had belonged to her relatives. we went down to the dry gorge and she pointed out all kinds of roots and trees. she asked me if i knew about the plants of the pasture. i said yes. i thought i was lying. as we walked farther from the house, i remember a hot gusty wind picked up her voice like dust tendrils on bedrock and blew it away from me. i ran to catch the sound. i found ain’t sally sitting on a granite rock. —ala tek. indian girl. —come and see, on our land, the four winds of the old days will blow through our hair. then she tugged at my black braids. —come and visit the snakes, ala tek. —when i was your age they blew across this place like red dust devils on flat neutral plains. —can you see them. —do you hear the snake people calling us?  —yes. i can see them. i hear them. they are naked and wild. their eyes, like black grapes shining in the sun, stare back at me. —they’re hungry. i watch the snake people eat the fleshy intestines of my uncle’s butchered cow. i taste the hot blood, roll it around on my tongue and remember. it makes me sweat. i watch the snake people play games around the carcass. and before we walk back into the house, the old woman and me, she runs her crooked fingers across my eyes and says. —ala tek. indian girl. —the ghosts of your ancestors will visit you there.  the rest of the visit blurs. my last memories are from that day. she waves to me from her front porch. she never explained the snakes. she only said, “che pisa lauchi. i’ll see you. indians never say good-bye.” i never saw ain’t sally again until she appeared in my hospital room. i thought she was dead. i didn’t know about the snakes until some twenty-five years later. to make the sign of the snake means: comanches are here.

NEW POEM
 thin are the night-skirts left behind by daybreak hours that onward creep, and thin, alas! the shred of sleep that wavers with the spirit's wind: but in half-dreams that shift and roll and still remember and forget, my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet.  our lives, most dear, are never near, our thoughts are never far apart, though all that draws us heart to heart seems fainter now and now more clear. to-night love claims his full control, and with desire and with regret my soul this hour has drawn your soul a little nearer yet.  is there a home where heavy earth melts to bright air that breathes no pain, where water leaves no thirst again and springing fire is love's new birth? if faith long bound to one true goal may there at length its hope beget, my soul that hour shall draw your soul for ever nearer yet.  
NEW POEM
 the ladies men admire, i’ve heard, would shudder at a wicked word. their candle gives a single light; they’d rather stay at home at night. they do not keep awake till three, nor read erotic poetry. they never sanction the impure, nor recognize an overture. they shrink from powders and from paints ... so far, i’ve had no complaints.

 this south american up here on a gugg walked in with his whore and she sat on the edge of my bed and crossed her fine legs and i kept looking at her legs and he pulled at his stringy necktie and i had a hangover and he asked me what do you think of the american poets? and i told him i didn’t think very much of the american poets and then he went on to ask some other very dull questions (as his whore’s legs layed along the side of my brain) like well? you don’t care about anything but if you were teaching a class and one of the students asked you which american poets they should read what would you tell them? she crossed her legs as i watched and i thought i could knock him out with one punch rape her in 4 minutes catch a train for l.a. get off in arizona and walk off into the desert and i couldn’t tell him that i would never teach a class that along with not liking american poetry that i didn’t like american classes either or the job that they would expect me to do, so i said whitman, t.s. eliot, d.h. lawrence’ poems about reptiles and beasts, auden. and then i realized that whitman was the only true american, that eliot was not an american somehow and the others certainly not, and he knew it too he knew that i had fucked up but i made no apologies thought some more about rape i almost loved the woman but i knew that when she walked out that i would never see her again and we shook hands and the gugg said he’d send me the article when it came out but i knew that he didn’t have an article and he knew it too and then he said i will send you some of my poems translated into english and i said fine and i watched them walk out of the place i watched her highheels clack down the tall green steps and then both of them were gone but i kept remembering her dress sliding all over her like a second skin and i was wild with mourning and love and sadness and being a fool unable to communicate anything and i walked in and finished that beer cracked another put on my ragged king’s coat and walked out into the new orleans street and that very night i sat with my friends and acted vile and the ass much mouth and villainy and cruelness and they never knew why.  
NEW POEM
 my mother—preferring the strange to the tame: dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung, frog’s belly distended with finny young, leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool, odd, small snakes roving through the leaves, metallic beetles rambling over stones: all wild and natural!—flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet, and held the little horror to the mirror, where he gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off.  depended from her pinched thumb, each wing came clattering down like a small black shutter. still tranquil, she began, “it’s rather sweet ...” the soft mouse body, the hard feral glint in the caught eyes. then we saw, and recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow, nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed. the thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud, swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop.  but still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor remained, of all my mother’s tender, wounding passion for a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life among its dens and burrows, its clean stones, whose denizens can turn upon the world with spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw, to sting or soil benevolence, alien as our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot. she swept to the kitchen. turning on the tap, she washed and washed the pity from her hands.  
NEW POEM
 on an island, an open road where an animal has been crushed by something larger than itself.  it is mangled by four o'clock light, soul sour-sweet, intestines flattened and raked by the sun, eyes still watchful, savage.  this landscape of taiwan looks like a body black and blue. on its coastline mussels have cracked their faces on rocks, clouds are collapsing  onto tiny houses. and just now a monsoon has begun. it reminds me of a story my father told me: he once made the earth not in seven days  but in one. his steely joints wielded lava and water and mercy in great ionic perfection. he began the world, hammering the length  of trees, trees like a war of families, trees which fumbled for grand gesture. the world began in an explosion of fever and rain.  he said, tina, your body came out floating. i was born in the middle of monsoon season, palm trees tearing the tin roofs.  now as i wander to the center of the island no one will speak to me. my dialect left somewhere in his pocket, in a nursery book,  a language of childsplay. everything unfurls in pictures: soil is washed from the soles of feet, a woman runs toward her weeping son, chicken bones float  in a pot full of dirty water. i return to the animal on the road. when i stoop to look at it  it smells of trash, rotting vegetation, the pitiful tongue. its claws are curled tight to its heart; eyes open eyes open.  when the world began in the small factory of my father's imagination he never spoke of this gnarled concoction  of bone and blood that is nothing like wonder but just the opposite, something simply ravaged. he too would die soon after  the making of the world. i would go on waking, sexing, mimicking enemies. i would go on coaxed by gravity and hard science.

 clarice, the swiss appraiser, paces our rooms, listing furnishings on her yellow legal pad with a waterman pen, a microcamera. although i've asked why we have to do this, i forgot the answer.  the answer to why is because, inscrutable, outside of logic, helpless, useless because. wing chairs, a deco lamp, my mother's cherry dining table—nothing we both loved using looks tragic.  most nights now i sit in the den reading the colorful spines of your art books, fra angelico to zurburan, volume after volume of balthus, botticelli, cezanne, degas, michelangelo, monet,  titian, velasquez. friends. an art school's asked for them— after all, they have no "real" value now, except to me.... upstairs, cerise—is that her name?—gasps at the bentwood chaise,  the blonde moderne bedroom "set" my parents bought on their two-day depression honeymoon in manhattan. i know this has something to do with paying taxes.  last night, a real icy february zero, i went out to start the engine of the car you gave me on my birthday, to keep it going, then came in and forgot it till this morning.  i woke to the city's recycling truck grinding my papers and plastic bottles and my motor running. and still, i wasn't out of gas, our neighbor, his head in a red bandana, yelled,  "we didn't want to bother you at one in the morning!" and i thought,how did you know i wasn't in there, suiciding? cerise means "cherry," clarice means "light" or "famous"—  is her name clarissa? what is she saying? she's blurring, she looks like a candice, she looks nice enough, but i'll defer judgement until she's finished this business.  if i let on i felt sad, remember my mother's advice? "everyone should collect something!" that was her path to the purpose-driven life, along rows of a flea market,  then alone in her house jammed with the nicked, the chipped, ceramics with dings, the inscribed wedding bands of strangers— damaged things that always needed gluing or polishing.  i tried not to teach our children the world's a dangerous place, but there we were, four of us, plunked into history, listening to dylan. then, two of us. our son and daughter out in it, unafraid, purposeful....  somehow, life veered from the script. i should get a new cell phone, but eighteen of your messages are in/on my old one and can't be transferred. how can verizon say your voice isn't  really in there at all, calling home to me?—then where is it? why should it disappear from somewhere is unapparently isn't? why should my living here be so metaphysical?  callista enters our bedroom, the room sacrosanct to me, off-limits, but no matter. she scans our night tables, our tv, our pills and lotions and clippers. oh, morning here  you'd perform what you'd call your "ablutions" while i read the paper in bed. pearl slinks from her place on my pillow, bogey's hunched in the clothes closer on your shearling slippers,  hosni mubarak's been deposed, benghazi's a riot of freedom until the khadaffis say it isn't. the day you died,  i knew what people meant by saying the earth stopped spinning  on its axis. no choice but to write myself, to keep going. today's science times s ays we're not in the garden of eden anymore— well, that shouldn't give evolutionary biologists pause. life,  says the geologists, is a natural consequence of geology. geology? i know there's got to be more to be written. clarissa, clarinda, career, whatever your name is,  pack up your digital camera, your officious watery pen, your scrutineer's notepad, you're in the wrong biosphere, your data will never add up—clarity, i think we're done here.

 silent, about-to-be-parted-from house. wood creaking, trying to sigh, impatient. clicking of squirrel-teeth in the attic. denuded beds, couches stripped of serapes.  deep snow shall block all entrances and oppress the roof and darken the windows.    o lares, don’t leave. the house yawns like a bear. guard its profound dreams for us, that it return to us when we return.   november 1969

 louisiana skies paddle north nodding hello to some exiles displaced by floodwaters so we all putter in the bisque in fretted dresses, alleviated by a fan. but we have nothing on  "le matin," in whose rococo frame a curtain sweeps to bare a boudoir, a bichon frisé worrying something between paws, begging the dulcet glance of the mistress whose push-up,  cupless corset and up-drawn stocking border what they fall short of, per the stern frame rippling like a cloud! even the candle angles to get a look in the mirror  engloving the scene. why it is her slipper the bitch clutches! the gentleman's reverie is elsewhere . . . loitering louisiana stops to admire this engraving by "n. lavreinee."  what a chevalier! it makes the smeariest sunset think it's in a restoration comedy, in such humidity chefs defer meringues. "ksar rouge," "taos adobe,"  "gulf shrimp"—a thousand names of softboiled lipsticks fritter english as if it were french, meaning meeting no resistance from the flesh.

 it was as if her love had become a big eye or some historical logic or a religious particle lodged in the brain. in the most costly services of a great society one may find the allure of a benign intelligence. i have hoped, since i was a child, to be surrounded by a group of articulate characters who might with gracious friendship provide some essential entertainment  as aaron’s which was a cane and then a snake and then a cane again  great clouds of smoke from the forest itsy bugs amarch my naked legs in my beard, to burn as one might with one’s eyes i learned, but can no longer remember with what dignity another’s care imbues one. you sit and pick the lice from my hair. what sort of life is this.

 we must stop bragging. there are limits for us to the cold and the twelfth night  marks them all. just off the coast of maine the lobster boats pass, dragging their nets.  capsize once in a while, in water like that you die, that’s all, that water  isn’t even frozen. not even frozen, and that’s as cold as it gets.  the hearts of birds beat voraciously so they keep warm, so if you put out  a feeder, keep it full of the seeds their hearts feed on, then it is only  when their food runs out that you find them inexpressibly taut in hollows,  and that’s as cold as it ever gets.

 it needn’t be tinder, this juncture of the year, a cigarette second guessed from car to brush.  the woods’ parchment is given to cracking asunder the first puff of wind. yesterday a big sycamore came across first and hawthorne and is there yet.  the papers say it has to happen, if just as dribs and drabs on the asbestos siding. but tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes.  a month’s supper things stacks in the sink. tea brews from water stoppered in the bath and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you, piece by piece, an xmas gift hidden and found weeks after: the ribbon, the box.  i have reservoirs of want enough to freeze many nights over.

 i think it is interesting though not exactly amusing how we go from day to day with no money. how do we do it, friends ask, suspecting we really have some stash stacked away somewhere. but we certainly do not and we also do not know how we do it either. you sure are lucky, some of our friends say. i am none too sure of that though, as i wait for the winning lottery numbers to be announced on cklw. thursday in detroit is the day of dreams. we have been dreaming of a place in the country lately and i’m none too sure that is very healthy. and speaking of health that’s also been a problem that probably has something to do with no money, since we’ve all been sick lately, taking turns politely of course. could you bring me some more tea one of us will ask, and the other will. in between the coughing and worrying our thoughts have often turned to crime. we seriously wonder how we can get away with a bundle with as little risk as possible. last week we took our last $12 out of the bank and noticed how much more they had there though we had none. of course we wouldn’t rob that bank, they know us there as the ones who bring the rolls of pennies in. and just yesterday they fish-eyed us for trying to cash our son’s xmas bond from his grandparents after only one month. so we wouldn’t try to rob that bank, but i do know of one up north that may be possible. . . i know this just seems like romantic dreaming but i practically make a career of reading detective stories, and god knows, i have no other. anyway if the right opportunity comes along, we are more than ready to meet it. but this is a time of waiting, the i ching says, though it does not say how we are to eat while waiting. and soon we will have another mouth to feed— ann now in her seventh month, and that is often in our thoughts. besides all that we are both over thirty, artist and poet, still waiting to cross the great water. meanwhile, day after day, there is still detroit to be dealt with — a small pond says our friend snee. big fish we used to answer him, but that was a while back. now we think maybe lake erie is the great water referred to in the i ching, and if we wait long enough we can walk across — to buffalo or cleveland. in a healthy person, says the philosopher, self-pity can be a forerunner to action: once the problem is seen clearly, a solution may be found at hand. and as i said, i think it is interesting though not exactly amusing.

 “let ’ s be the same wound if we must bleed. let ’ s fight side by side, even if the enemy is ourselves: i am yours, you are mine.”  —tommy olofsson, sweden i’m not interested in who suffered the most. i’m interested in people getting over it.  once when my father was a boy a stone hit him on the head. hair would never grow there. our fingers found the tender spot and its riddle: the boy who has fallen stands up. a bucket of pears in his mother’s doorway welcomes him home. the pears are not crying. later his friend who threw the stone says he was aiming at a bird. and my father starts growing wings.  each carries a tender spot: something our lives forgot to give us. a man builds a house and says, “i am native now.” a woman speaks to a tree in place of her son. and olives come. a child’s poem says, “i don’t like wars, they end up with monuments.” he’s painting a bird with wings wide enough to cover two roofs at once.  why are we so monumentally slow? soldiers stalk a pharmacy: big guns, little pills. if you tilt your head just slightly it’s ridiculous.  there’s a place in my brain where hate won’t grow. i touch its riddle: wind, and seeds. something pokes us as we sleep.  it’s late but everything comes next.  
NEW POEM
 your jewel box of white balsa strips and bleached green czechoslovakian rushes stands open where you keep it shelved in the bathroom. morning and evening i see you comb its seawrack tangle of shell, stone, wood, glass, metal, bone, seed for the bracelet, earring, necklace, brooch or ring you need. here's brass from nepal, a bangle of african ivory and chased silver for your wrist, a twist of polished sandalwood seeds, deep scarlet, gleaming like the fossil tears of some long-gone exotic bird with ruby crest, sapphire claws. adriatic blue, this lapis lazuli disc will brighten the pale of your throat, and on this small alabaster seal-ring the phantom of light inscribes a woman tilting an amphora, clear as day, almost as old as alexander. to the ebony velvet brim of your hat you'll pin a perfect oval of abalone, a dark-whorled underwater sheen to lead us to work this foggy february morning. we'll leave your nest of brightness in the bathroom between the mirror and the laundry-basket where my dirty shirts sprawl like drunks amongst your skirts and blouses. lace- work frills and rainbow silk pastels, your panties foam over the plastic brim, and on the shower-rail your beige and talc-white bras dangle by one strap like the skinned wicklow rabbits i remember hanging from hooks outside the victuallers' big windows. we've been domesticated strangely, love, according to our lights: when you walk by me now, naked and not quite dry from the shower, i flatten my two hands on your wet flank, and wonder at the tall column of flesh you are, catching the faint morning light that polishes you pale as alabaster. you're warm, and stay a moment still like that, as though we were two planets pausing in their separate orbits, pendant, on the point of crossing. for one pulse-stroke they take stock of their bodies before returning to the journey. dressed, you select a string of chipped amber to hang round your neck, a pair of star-shaped earrings, a simple ring of jet-black lustrous onyx. going down the stairs and out to the fogbound street, you light my way.  
NEW POEM
 the gods do not interest him, nor their debris, nor their terrible storms: he already knows how a body is made to glow, precursor to neon lights —  how hunger is hereditary. sons should not be haunted except by the dead, and his father is sober now, accepts tribute in silence and coca-cola.  he is thankful for strong knees, for momentum that lives in the mouth and the hands.  here is the fish with the filigree scales, here is the pot of rice — here, here: the grain of rice that makes the bowl a bowl. tuna’s blood hardening in the water. here is the night through which he runs, realizing the floor has turned to tissue paper, tearing into morning. no, the gods  do not compel him: he cannot bear the sight of the sun, an open sore — prefers the colors of its setting, how they reflect the ocean’s currents, always giving rise to something new or something he has forgotten.  the sky as a table, mounds of rice glazed with soy, gleaming like a display of mackerel, like snow general upon the island’s winter spine. days parade in their uniform; hearts attack, close  markets, open new ones. he teaches his sons to gut fish, does not despair his own hands’ speed: salt bandaging a cut, memory fraying at the edges. reaching, always — the top of the ladder, buried in light —

 the bleached wood massed in bone piles, we pulled it from dark beach and built fire in a fenced clearing. the posts’ blunt stubs sank down, they circled and were roofed by milled lumber dragged at one time to the coast. we slept there.  each morning the minus tide— weeds flowed it like hair swimming. the starfish gripped rock, pastel, rough. fish bones lay in sun.  each noon the milk fog sank from cloud cover, came in our clothes and held them tighter on us. sea stacks stood and disappeared. they came back when the sun scrubbed out the inlet.  we went down to piles to get mussels, i made my shirt a bowl of mussel stones, carted them to our grate where they smoked apart. i pulled the mussel lip bodies out, chewed their squeak. we went up the path for fresh water, berries. hardly speaking, thinking.  during low tide we crossed to the island, climbed its wet summit. the redfoots and pelicans dropped for fish. oclets so silent fell toward water with linked feet.  jacynthe said little. long since we had spoken nova scotia, michigan, and knew beauty in saying nothing. she told me about her mother who would come at them with bread knives then stop herself, her face emptied.  i told her about me, never lied. at night at times the moon floated. we sat with arms tight watching flames spit, snap. on stone and sand picking up wood shaped like a body, like a gull.  i ran barefoot not only on beach but harsh gravels up through the woods. i shit easy, covered my dropping. some nights, no fires, we watched sea pucker and get stabbed by the beacon circling on tatoosh.   2  i stripped and spread on the sea lip, stretched to the slap of the foam and the vast red dulce. jacynthe gripped the earth in her fists, opened— the boil of the tide shuffled into her.  the beach revolved, headlands behind us put their pines in the sun. gulls turned a strong sky. their pained wings held, they bit water quick, lifted. their looping eyes continually measure the distance from us, bare women who do not touch.  rocks drowsed, holes filled with suds from a distance. a deep laugh bounced in my flesh and sprayed her.   3  flies crawled us, jacynthe crawled. with her palms she spread my calves, she moved my heels from each other. a woman’s mouth is not different, sand moved wild beneath me, her long hair wiped my legs, with women there is sucking, the water slops our bodies. we come clean, our clits beat like twins to the loons rising up.  we are awake. snails sprinkle our gulps. fish die in our grips, there is sand in the anus of dancing. tatoosh island hardens in the distance. we see its empty stones sticking out of the sea again. jacynthe holds tinder under fire to cook the night’s wood.  if we had men i would make milk in me simply.

 kick in the heart. kick the starting lance. throw the ground a word and stand back. the color of terror is the envy on body rags, the dragonfly war scraped off a painting inside the door.  kick the shame. kick the falling dawn as fortunate. throw the corrupted guest out the door. a sequence of rhythms bound for the light on your bed. on the eggplant cooked for the husband working late: an ant, a hair— the only thing said to race the mind. take someone else’s voice and touch their ears. make sure they hear you cry in their own whispers, their harangue.  kick the soil. kick the sweet drowning as if you know the round jubilance of pear is afraid of a darkening spoon, a honey of flavor, the tender one who never touches your plate. the tired one who rations food to thank god eternity is here and there.  slip the eye the blue-black stranger, his instrument of scars and neglect, its tune of every wish besides the grave of a careless, quiet man. shape his sound into the thumb asking for a ride in the years of not going anywhere.  kick the alphabet. kick the hungry thigh and try again. reduce yourself to a moving mouth, a solemn happiness that smells of the past, takes hold of the throat and teaches you to despise omens— ignore apache mirrors on rock arches as if you knew what their scratchings meant.  kick the heart. kick the starting lance. it moves deeper into the month of blinking neon where vertigo is perfume, desire foaming on your bare feet killed by frost, taken by the animal waking inside your holy cross— a figure of green gowns and things that follows you until you dance.  kick the truth. kick the belly until it confesses. admit you were fed by a woman flapping in the wind, told to sit there by a father who made her give birth to a shimmering head, your brain of flowers blossoming upon the body always first to confess.  what snow is left is tired water unmoved by your seasonal words, your circle healing by slowing down, swelling to the size of god, yellow leaves in the blood nothing dangerous— this impulse, this kick to the brittle lake where the snow goes away.

 for carol rigolot when deeds splay before us precious as gold &amp; unused chances stripped from the whine-bone, we know the moment kindheartedness walks in. each praise be echoes us back as the years uncount themselves, eating salt. though blood first shaped us on the climbing wheel, the human mind lit by the savanna’s ice star &amp; thistle rose, your knowing gaze enters a room &amp; opens the day, saying we were made for fun. even the bedazzled brute knows when sunlight falls through leaves across honed knives on the table. if we can see it push shadows aside, growing closer, are we less broken? a barometer, temperature gauge, a ruler in minus fractions &amp; pedigrees, a thingmajig, a probe with an all-seeing eye, what do we need to measure kindness, every unheld breath, every unkind leapyear? sometimes a sober voice is enough to calm the waters &amp; drive away the false witnesses, saying, look, here are the broken treaties beauty brought to us earthbound sentinels.

 ’ασíνην τε . . . — iliad all morning long we looked around the citadel starting from the shaded side there where the sea green and without lustre — breast of a slain peacock — received us like time without an opening in it. veins of rock dropped down from high above, twisted vines, naked, many-branched, coming alive at the water’s touch, while the eye following them struggled to escape the monotonous see-saw motion, growing weaker and weaker.  on the sunny side a long empty beach and the light striking diamonds on the huge walls. no living thing, the wild doves gone and the king of asini, whom we’ve been trying to find for two years now, unknown, forgotten by all, even by homer, only one word in the iliad and that uncertain, thrown here like the gold burial mask. you touched it, remember its sound? hollow in the light like a dry jar in dug earth: the same sound that our oars make in the sea. the king of asini a void under the mask everywhere with us everywhere with us, under a name: ‘’ασíνην τε. . .’ασíνην τε. . .’ and his children statues and his desires the fluttering of birds, and the wind in the gaps between his thoughts, and his ships anchored in a vanished port: under the mask a void.  behind the large eyes the curved lips the curls carved in relief on the gold cover of our existence a dark spot that you see travelling like a fish in the dawn calm of the sea: a void everywhere with us. and the bird, a wing broken, that flew away last winter — tabernacle of life — and the young woman who left to play with the dog-teeth of summer and the soul that sought the lower world gibbering and the country like a large plane-leaf swept along by the torrent of the sun with the ancient monuments and the contemporary sorrow.  and the poet lingers, looking at the stones, and asks himself does there really exist among these ruined lines, edges, points, hollows and curves does there really exist here where one meets the path of rain, wind and ruin does there exist the movement of the face, shape of the tenderness of those who’ve waned so strangely in our lives, those who remained the shadow of waves and thoughts with the sea’s boundlessness or perhaps no, nothing is left but the weight the nostalgia for the weight of a living existence there where we now remain unsubstantial, bending like the branches of a terrible willow tree heaped in unremitting despair while the yellow current slowly carries down rushes uprooted in the mud image of a form that the sentence to everlasting bitterness has turned to stone: the poet a void.  shieldbearer, the sun climbed warring, and from the depths of the cave a startled bat hit the light as an arrow hits a shield: ‘’ασíνην τε. . .’ασíνην τε. . .’. if only that could be the king of asini we’ve been searching for so carefully on this acropolis sometimes touching with our fingers his touch upon the stones.   asini, summer ’38—athens, jan. ’40

 the fork lived with the knife and found it hard — for years took nicks and scratches, not to mention cuts.  she who took tedium by the ears: nonforthcoming pickles, defiant stretched-out lettuce, sauce-gooed particles.  he who came down whack. his conversation, even, edged.  lying beside him in the drawer she formed a crazy patina. the seasons stacked — melons, succeeded by cured pork.  he dulled; he was a dull knife, while she was, after all, a fork.

 not straight, but in waves  it seems every advance in the process deepens the subject’s relations to inner objects, happiness in regaining them  after feeling adrift and lost, an increased trust because they appear good and helpful after all, as in the child  step by step, building his relations to external objects, gaining not only from things pleasant, but from ways in which the child  overcomes frustrations . . . mrs. a, for instance: finally walking down familiar streets with a friend: an attempt at old bonds. yet moments into the stroll  the number of bustling people is too much, the buildings strange, the sunlight artificial, bleak . . . so that she has to retreat indoors into  a restaurant for a chair, but even there the walls are buckling, the diners and waiters blurred— indifferent to what she carries inside, her home  suddenly the only tolerable place— pictures of her boy, his drawings, in each and every room.

 it should have a woman's name, something to tell us how the green skirt of land has bound its hips. when the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge, the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack, and the child's voice that you have heard below sings of the sea.  by slow movements of the earth's crust, or is it that her hip bones have been shaped by a fault of engineering? some coquetry cycles this blue edge, a spring ready to come forth to correct love's mathematics.  saturday rises immaculately. the water's jade edge plays against corn-colored picnic baskets, rose and lemon bottles, red balloons, dancers in purple tights, a roan mare out of its field. it is not the moment to think of bahia and the gray mother with her water explanation. not far from here, the city, a mass of swift water in its own depression, licks its sores.  still, i would be eased by reasons. sand dunes in drifts. lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base. blindness enters where the light refuses to go. in loch lomond, the water flowers with algae and a small life has taken the name of a star.  you will hear my star-slow heart empty itself with a light-swift pitch where the water thins to a silence. and the woman who will not be named screams in the birth of her fading away.

 when i see the houses in this city, the electric gates and uniformed men employed to guard the riches of the rich, the gilded columns and gardens, the boats on water, i wonder, how to describe my home to you: the short, mud walls, the whispering roof, the veranda on which my whole family used to spread sheets and sleep.  the year i came to find work in the city, my wife painted our house white so it would be brighter than the neighbours'. i beat her for her foolishness. the children are hungry, i said, the cow is old, the money collector is after my blood, and you steal like a magpie— half a month's wage—to decorate your nest like a shiny jewel?  the monsoon finally arrived the year i left, dripped through the thatch, peeled paint off the walls. the wells grew full and overflowed. the farmers rejoiced in the fields. my son sat with his mouth open catching drops of water like a frog. my wife clung to the walls and wept.  when i fall asleep on the pavements in this city, i try to imagine my wife's skin against mine, the kohl in her eyes, the white walls, the whole village sky bearing down upon us with all the weight of the stars. i think of returning to that life, but mostly i try to remember how the world was once. i want to open my mouth like my son, and swallow things whole— feel water filling all the voids, until i am shaped back into existence.

 when you move away, you see how much depends on the pace of the days—how much depended on the haze we waded through each summer, visible heat, wavy and discursive as the lazy track of the snake in the dusty road; and on the habit in town of porches thatched in vines, and in the country long dense promenades, the way we sacrificed the yards to shade. it was partly the heat that made my father plant so many trees—two maples marking the site for the house, two elms on either side when it was done; mimosa by the fence, and as it failed, fast-growing chestnuts, loblolly pines; and dogwood, redbud, ornamental crab. on the farm, everything else he grew something could eat, but this would be a permanent mark of his industry, a glade established in the open field. or so it seemed. looking back at the empty house from across the hill, i see how well the house is camouflaged, see how that porous fence of saplings, their later scrim of foliage, thickened around it, and still he chinked and mortared, planting more. last summer, although he’d lost all tolerance for heat, he backed the truck in at the family grave and stood in the truckbed all afternoon, pruning the landmark oak, repairing recent damage by a wind; then he came home and hung a swing in one of the horse-chestnuts for my visit. the heat was a hand at his throat, a fist to his weak heart. but it made a triumph of the cooler air inside, in the bedroom, in the maple bedstead where he slept, in the brick house nearly swamped by leaves.

 (for harlem magic) the laws of science teach us a pound of gold weighs as much as a pound of flour though if dropped from any undetermined height in their natural state one would reach bottom and one would fly away  laws of motion tell us an inert object is more difficult to propel than an object heading in the wrong direction is to turn around. motion being energy—inertia—apathy. apathy equals hostility. hostility—violence. violence being energy is its own virtue. laws of motion teach us  black people are no less confused because of our blackness than we are diffused because of our powerlessness. man we are told is the only animal who smiles with his lips. the eyes however are the mirror of the soul  the problem with love is not what we feel but what we wish we felt when we began to feel we should feel something. just as publicity is not production: seduction is not seductive  if i could make a wish i’d wish for all the knowledge of all the world. black may be beautiful professor micheau says but knowledge is power. any desirable object is bought and sold—any neglected object declines in value. it is against man’s nature to be in either category  if white defines black and good defines evil then men define women or women scientifically speaking describe men. if sweet is the opposite of sour and heat the absence of cold then love is the contradiction of pain and beauty is in the eye of the beheld  sometimes i want to touch you and be touched in return. but you think i’m grabbing and i think you’re shirking and mama always said to look out for men like you  so i go to the streets with my lips painted red and my eyes carefully shielded to seduce the world my reluctant lover  and you go to your men slapping fives feeling good posing as a man because you know as long as you sit very very still the laws of motion will be in effect

 i have walked through many lives, some of them my own, and i am not who i was, though some principle of being abides, from which i struggle not to stray. when i look behind, as i am compelled to look before i can gather strength to proceed on my journey, i see the milestones dwindling toward the horizon and the slow fires trailing from the abandoned camp-sites, over which scavenger angels wheel on heavy wings. oh, i have made myself a tribe out of my true affections, and my tribe is scattered! how shall the heart be reconciled to its feast of losses? in a rising wind the manic dust of my friends, those who fell along the way, bitterly stings my face. yet i turn, i turn, exulting somewhat, with my will intact to go wherever i need to go, and every stone on the road precious to me. in my darkest night, when the moon was covered and i roamed through wreckage, a nimbus-clouded voice directed me: “live in the layers, not on the litter.” though i lack the art to decipher it, no doubt the next chapter in my book of transformations is already written. i am not done with my changes.

 ... if thou shouldst not be glad, i would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb, sepulch’ring an adult’ress. — william shakespeare , king lear he faked my death, set up this ranch far from my three  daughters. suburban hellhole. with bracelet on ankle, house-  arrest. at noon the bully sun shoulders a ripe  moon. in the dark soaps reign. the anchors will often flash  their glitterati weddings. not one daughter has birthed  an heir. in vitro — be damned. i hose the lawn and count  the cars like fish slipping their shiny chrome along asphalt.  which sparrow missed? cordelia — my gutted heart.  
NEW POEM
 on magnolia avenue there are no magnolias. someone bought the house of the one survivor. all morning i heard the chainsaw sever its limbs from root to bud. no more scattered flowers, star city. no pink galaxy. now the yard is a parking space, one jeep suv, one older car. next door a woman comes out, late afternoon, a child in her arms. she speaks low, as if there’s just the two of them. she says to him, listen to the little birdies, and he listens to the common sparrows talking in the hedge. he listens as they argue back and forth, their dialect of nature, as the street clatters with commuters taking a shortcut home. she says: listen. and he turns his head to follow the fugitive motion, the small streaked wings unfolding, folding, the relentless chirp from a tiny blunt beak, the sound almost within reach.  
NEW POEM
 let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. let us go hence together without fear; keep silence now, for singing-time is over, and over all old things and all things dear. she loves not you nor me as all we love her. yea, though we sang as angels in her ear, she would not hear.  let us rise up and part; she will not know. let us go seaward as the great winds go, full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? there is no help, for all these things are so, and all the world is bitter as a tear. and how these things are, though ye strove to show, she would not know.  let us go home and hence; she will not weep. we gave love many dreams and days to keep, flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, saying 'if thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.' all is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; and we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep, she would not weep.  let us go hence and rest; she will not love. she shall not hear us if we sing hereof, nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; and though she saw all heaven in flower above, she would not love.  let us give up, go down; she will not care. though all the stars made gold of all the air, and the sea moving saw before it move one moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair; though all those waves went over us, and drove deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair, she would not care.  let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. sing all once more together; surely she, she too, remembering days and words that were, will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, we are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me, she would not see.

 let it be known to all, the story of the glorious struggle of my people. let it be known that black men and women helped to build this our country. let it be known that black men and women of the past in an effort to make this country what it ought to be, gave up their very last to make america, a real democracy a true homeland of the free. let our leaders of today go back into the past and come fighting forth envigored with the spirit of turner, and vesey, douglass, tubman and truth. let our stalwart black youth, lift their heads in pride as they tell of their fathers' fight for freedom to the white youth by their side. yes, let it be known. let all of the old folks tell it sing it to the babes yet in arms. let us read the glorious story right along with our bible. let it be known to all, the story of the glorious struggles of my people. too long…too long has it been kept from us.

NEW POEM
 one of the objects i've treasured most in my life is this letter scale which, long ago, you gave me. i was an active correspondent at the time, even sending lots of letters overseas. while still enjoying the pleasure of going to the post, i now had another: assessing exactly, in advance, at my counter, the cost of packets and envelopes, to which, price list in hand, i stuck my stamps. i use it less these days, this quite simple device graded with little marks up to a whole pound, for my mailings rarely still exceed the price of an ordinary stamp. the tray of polished metal's now covered with dust, without the slightest hint that the red pointer marking the weight on the front has budged. but in the long run, one would, i think, discern a difference and see how much the months were worth in terms of dust, the seasons elapsed since the previous weighing. but having been seized, suddenly, just this morning, by a tremendous attack (annual) of cleaning, from which nothing is released, i restored to the tray's slightly concave stainless steel, that ever so slightly distorted mirror, its polished shine. it reflected all of the sky, through which clouds reeled, and i could confirm that space does not weigh more than time.  
NEW POEM
 october2017  you once said:my reward for this life will be a thousand pounds of dirt shoveled in my face. you were wrong. you are seven pounds of ashes in a box, a puerto rican flag wrapped around you, next to a red brick from the house in utuado where you were born, all crammed together on my bookshelf. you taught me there is no god, no life after this life, so i know you are not watching me type this letter over my shoulder.  when i was a boy, you were god. i watched from the seventh floor of the projects as you walked down into the street to stop a public execution. a big man caught a small man stealing his car, and everyone in brooklyn heard the car alarm wail of the condemned:he’s killing me. at a word from you, the executioner’s hand slipped from the hair of the thief.the kid was high, was all you said when you came back to us.  when i was a boy, and you were god, we flew to puerto rico. you said: my grandfather was the mayor of utuado. his name was buenaventura. that means good fortune. i believed in your grandfather’s name. i heard the tree frogs chanting to each other all night. i saw banana leaf and elephant palm sprouting from the mountain’s belly. i gnawed the mango’s pit, and the sweet yellow hair stuck between my teeth. i said to you:you came from another planet. how did you do it? you said:every morning, just before i woke up, i saw the mountains.  every morning, i see the mountains. in utuado, three sisters, all in their seventies, all bedridden, all pentecostales who only left the house for church, lay sleeping on mattresses spread across the floor when the hurricane gutted the mountain the way a butcher slices open a dangled pig, and a rolling wall of mud buried them, leaving the fourth sister to stagger into the street, screaming like an unheeded prophet about the end of the world. in utuado, a man who cultivated a garden of aguacate and carambola, feeding the avocado and star fruit to his nieces from new york, saw the trees in his garden beheaded all at once like the soldiers of a beaten army, and so hanged himself. in utuado, a welder and a handyman rigged a pulley with a shopping cart to ferry rice and beans across the river where the bridge collapsed, witnessed the cart swaying above so many hands, then raised a sign that told the helicopters:campamento los olvidados: camp of the forgotten.  los olvidados wait seven hours in line for a government meal of skittles and vienna sausage, or a tarp to cover the bones of a house with no roof, as the fungus grows on their skin from sleeping on mattresses drenched with the spit of the hurricane. they drink the brown water, waiting for microscopic monsters in their bellies to visit plagues upon them. a nurse says:these people are going to have an epidemic. these people are going to die. the president flips rolls of paper towels to a crowd at a church in guaynabo, zeus lobbing thunderbolts on the locked ward of his delusions. down the block, cousin ricardo, bernice’s boy, says that somebody stole his can of diesel. i heard somebody ask you once what puerto rico needed to be free. and you said:tres pulgadas de sangre en la calle: three inches of blood in the street. now, three inches of mud flow through the streets of utuado, and troops patrol the town, as if guarding the vein of copper in the ground, as if a shovel digging graves in the backyard might strike the ore below, as if la brigada swinging machetes to clear the road might remember the last uprising.  i know you are not god. i have the proof: seven pounds of ashes in a box on my bookshelf. gods do not die, and yet i want you to be god again. stride from the crowd to seize the president’s arm before another roll of paper towels sails away. thunder spanish obscenities in his face. banish him to a roofless rainstorm in utuado, so he unravels, one soaked sheet after another, till there is nothing left but his cardboard heart.  i promised myself i would stop talking to you, white box of gray grit. you were deaf even before you died. hear my promise now: i will take you to the mountains, where houses lost like ships at sea rise blue and yellow from the mud. i will open my hands. i will scatter your ashes in utuado.

 the bioluminescent undersides of squid render them invisible to predators below. that the radiance of the boy’s anger might protect him.  walking the dog and stepping on a patch of repaired road, i remember the soft spot in his head.  you’re deaf as a beagle. no, you are.  can i feel the tide’s drag on the turning earth increase each day’s duration?  a hair in my nostril has gone white.  in absolute night, from my bed, i hear him aiming for the toilet’s center. the sound deepens, voice finding its register.  scientists call it an entangled system.  we survive christmas, his face pressed to the smooshed bosom of his grandmother in a house so immaculate, the spider in the seam of the ceiling stands out obscenely.  like a star at the outskirts of the galaxy, and slung around by the gravity of dark matter. for now, he goes where we go, but he does not belong to us.  i begin to begin my sentences leaning toward him, taking a deep breath.  he relinquishes the conversation with a contraction of his pupils.  what is for one of us the throb of the immediate is, for the other, the imminent mundane.  when napalm hits my brain, he takes on the tranquillity of a blinking newt.  she finds a photograph of him at seven. the sheer expressed of his face. as among michelangelo’s early drawings, there is a copy of masacchio’s lost sagra, the consecration.  we search our memories of him for a certain unity of characteristics that would hold through the permutations he now submits to us.  when it clings to the wire-and-rug surrogate, lab technicians shock it again. instead of releasing, it clings tighter.  throwing himself into the back seat after wrestling practice, mat burns on his cheek and forehead.  his muteness an onomatopoeia of the rising moon.

 every morning the maple leaves. every morning another chapter where the hero shifts from one foot to the other. every morning the same big and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out you will be alone always and then you will die. so maybe i wanted to give you something more than a catalog of non-definitive acts, something other than the desperation. dear so-and-so, i’m sorry i couldn’t come to your party. dear so-and-so, i’m sorry i came to your party and seduced you and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing. you want a better story. who wouldn’t? a forest, then. beautiful trees. and a lady singing. love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on. what a sweet lady. sing lady, sing! of course, she wakes the dragon. love always wakes the dragon and suddenly flames everywhere. i can tell already you think i’m the dragon, that would be so like me, but i’m not. i’m not the dragon. i’m not the princess either. who am i? i’m just a writer. i write things down. i walk through your dreams and invent the future. sure, i sink the boat of love, but that comes later. and yes, i swallow glass, but that comes later. and the part where i push you flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks, shut up i’m getting to it. for a while i thought i was the dragon. i guess i can tell you that now. and, for a while, i thought i was the princess, cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle, young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with confidence but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess, while i’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire, and getting stabbed to death. okay, so i’m the dragon. big deal. you still get to be the hero. you get magic gloves! a fish that talks! you get eyes like flashlights! what more do you want? i make you pancakes, i take you hunting, i talk to you as if you’re really there. are you there, sweetheart? do you know me? is this microphone live? let me do it right for once, for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes, you know the story, simply heaven. inside your head you hear a phone ringing and when you open your eyes only a clearing with deer in it. hello deer. inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion. hello darling, sorry about that. sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how i ruined everything by saying it out loud. especially that, but i should have known. you see, i take the parts that i remember and stitch them back together to make a creature that will do what i say or love me back. i’m not really sure why i do it, but in this version you are not feeding yourself to a bad man against a black sky prickled with small lights. i take it back. the wooden halls like caskets. these terms from the lower depths. i take them back. here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed. crossed out. clumsy hands in a dark room. crossed out. there is something underneath the floorboards. crossed out. and here is the tabernacle reconstructed. here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it. inside your head you hear a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up in a stranger’s bathroom, standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away from the dirtiest thing you know. all the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly darkness, suddenly only darkness. in the living room, in the broken yard, in the back of the car as the lights go by. in the airport bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of unnatural light, my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away. and then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts. i arrived in the city and you met me at the station, smiling in a way that made me frightened. down the alley, around the arcade, up the stairs of the building to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things, i looked out the window and said this doesn’t look that much different from home, because it didn’t, but then i noticed the black sky and all those lights. we walked through the house to the elevated train. all these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful mechanical wind. we were inside the train car when i started to cry. you were crying too, smiling and crying in a way that made me even more hysterical. you said i could have anything i wanted, but i just couldn’t say it out loud. actually, you said love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. it’s like a religion. it’s terrifying. no one will ever want to sleep with you.

 9:13 p.m., lucky bock in hand, i inscribe: walked the lovely 33 blocks to school today, streets clear and thick melting snow all around. taught my 4 hours of poetry; the afternoon class was hard; kid named schweikert kept on fucking up. took typed-up poems of yesterday to platt and put up poster there of anne and reed’s reading sat. ate nearly 2 peanutbutter sandwiches with raw carrots. typed. read kids’ poems. at 4 i started home, got a ride with jim bay. press release to daily paper. stopped in baird’s for 2 beers, looked at paper. home, kissed mara, sierra. in the mail: out there, from chicago, and a letter stating the city of grand island had decided not to prosecute re my arrest friday for intoxication. wonder why. nick the landlord didn’t show (he was supposed to have us sign lease on the new duplex) (this place gonna be torn down). ate a very delicious supper, ham-and-cheese rarebit with cold broccoli and cold oregano’d tomato, cooked by mara. paperwork, played a game of solitaire, harried by sierra’s new red car. dropped over then to the korner bar, put up a poster under the phone sign, said hi to a few folks and got halloo’d by this guy i’d spoken to 2 months before, who’d said his high school son adored me, but it might be thought improper that i hang around, shoot pool in korner bar. a beefy mid-30’s man, he bought me a beer, apologized and told me of his luck: he’d won a thousand one-hundred eighty dollars today betting on one horse at fonner park. we talked of poetry, family, work — he mentioned kilmer, stevenson, nash and others, quoted verbatim his own published poem on fire-fighting (he is the g.i. fire-chief). his boyhood favorites, whom he reads all of even now: edgar rice burroughts and jules verne. his son, though epileptic, does the high jump at the high school; he was disturbed that it wasn’t the broad jump, in which he himself still holds a record, set in 1959. the taxes have jumped up like crazy on their nice spread just inside the city limits. i got up and slapped him on the back and left, stopping first to ask clark, standing end of the bar, what he knew of me on friday night at the kyriss. i’d blanked out completely (woke up in jail, ate blue oatmeal). he said i’d just got drunk, he thought rod had taken me home. he said, at one point, just waking up, i’d grabbed the edge of the table and tilted it till the glasses all came sliding down and almost off, then tilted it back till they slid back to where they were, and never spilled a drop. he said i’d bought some beers for him and pat but before they could get to them drank them up myself. okay, clark, you’re a good guy with your black curly hair and toothless grin, and your wild life. i was just wondering. check with rod when have a chance. — and off, through mud and occasionally-lighted puddles, home, where mara’s napping still and there are (were) 5 lucky bocks in the white (today!) icebox. 9:50.   (no. 2)  after finishing that (immediately after, during, in fact) the strange thing is there’s so much left out. last night finished reading the vicar of wakefield. the bluejays and cardinals that called on the way to school. my beard suddenly seems soft (that thought off some day-dreaming about talking to poetry students). reread (for the last “making” time) “the 14,” the magazine; it is all set. the poems there, here now, seemed so abstract, compared with what i’m used to, but that in a way intensely and properly shaking feeling and talk, tonight. the revolution (mara gets up, starts drinking pepsi) and all that.

 there is another world, but it is in this one.  paul eluard  first there were those who died before i was born. it was as if they had just left and their shadows would slip out after them under the door so recently closed the air in its path was still swirling to rest. some of the furniture came from them, i was told, and one day i opened two chests of drawers to learn what the dead kept.  but it was when i learned to read that i began always to live among the dead. i remember rapunzel, the improved animals in the just-so stories, and a flock of birds that saved themselves from a hunter by flying in place in the shape of a tree, their wings imitating the whisk of wind in the leaves.  my sons and i are like some wine the dead have already bottled. they wish us well, but there is nothing they can do for us. sebastian cries in his sleep, i bring him into my bed, talk to him, rub his back. to help his sons live easily among the dead is a father’s great work. now sebastian drifts, soon he’ll sleep. we can almost hear the dead breathing. they sound like water under a ship at sea.  to love the dead is easy. they are final, perfect. but to love a child is sometimes to fail at love while the dead look on with their abstract sorrow.  to love a child is to turn away from the patient dead. it is to sleep carefully in case he cries.  later, when my sons are grown among their own dead, i can dive easily into sleep and loll among the coral of my dreams growing on themselves until at the end i almost never dream of anyone, except my sons, who is still alive.

 you couples lying where moon-scythes and day-scythes reaped you, browning fruit falls and sleeps in tangled nests, the wild grass, falls from your apple tree that still grows here: cry for your dead hero, his weak sword, his flight, that you were slaughtered and your bed poured whiteness, the issue of murdered marriage dawns. the streets crack, a house falls open to the air, sun and rain lie on the bed. and the river still runs in a child’s hands under the factory’s black hulk, four stacks that used to bloom with smoke over shining leaves, beneath thunderheads. then the storm shatters and beats and after in woods a scented smoke of light, a dripping quiet, and the small gold snake sparkles at the pond’s edge. but who is he? what were the goods he made, what became of his loved wife, his children, and where has he gone, fearsome, powerless? the silver path of air from the river’s bend to its rippling away beneath the low concrete bridge is still pure. no one comes, and the child who watched by it has vanished. or sometimes he appears for a day, a night, in the walls and windows reflected on the water, in goldfinches’ flight, cricket song, the heron’s great rise from the bank. last a carp leaps, voices and a lantern slide down the secret stream in black and gold peace, past the child’s husk, the family never born.

 it’s not that i don’t like the hospital. those small bouquets of flowers, pert and brave. the smell of antiseptic cleansers. the ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true. my friend, the one who’s dying, took me out to where the patients go to smoke, iv’s and oxygen in tanks attached to them— a tiny patio for skeletons. we shared a cigarette, which was delicious but too brief. i held his hand; it felt like someone’s keys. how beautiful it was, the sunlight pointing down at us, as if we were important, full of life, unbound. i wandered for a moment where his ribs had made a space for me, and there, beside the thundering waterfall of his heart, i rubbed my eyes and thought, “i’m lost.”

 the heart dies without space for love, without a moral horizon: think of it then as a bird trapped in a box. my heart goes out with love to those beyond the fence; only toward them can one really advance, that is, make progress. without them i feel i’m half a person. romeo was born a montague, and juliet came from the capulet line, and i’m a disciple of shakespeare, not ben gurion— therefore i’ll be delighted if my daughter marries the grandson of haidar abdel shafi. i mean this, of course, as a parable only—but the parable is my measure, and since it has more to do with my body than teeth or hair, this isn’t just some idle fancy that, out of poetic license, i place our fate in my daughter’s sex. that i grant myself this imaginary gift, testifies to the extent to which we’re living, still, in the underworld, where we’re granted the hope and potential of an amoeba. but all mythology begins with creatures that creep and crawl, spring out of the ground and devour each other, until a sacred union occurs, healing the breach in the world. the arab groom from gaza, too, will extend to my daughter a dress on which is embroidered the land redeemed from apartheid’s curse— our land as a whole, belonging equally to all of its offspring, and then he’ll lift the veil from her face, and say to her: “and now i take you to be my wife, lotem abdel shafi.”

 where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles, miles and miles on the solitary pastures where our sheep half-asleep tinkle homeward thro' the twilight, stray or stop as they crop— was the site once of a city great and gay, (so they say) of our country's very capital, its prince ages since held his court in, gathered councils, wielding far peace or war.  now the country does not even boast a tree, as you see, to distinguish slopes of verdure, certain rills from the hills intersect and give a name to, (else they run into one) where the domed and daring palace shot its spires up like fires o'er the hundred-gated circuit of a wall bounding all made of marble, men might march on nor be prest twelve abreast.  and such plenty and perfection, see, of grass never was! such a carpet as, this summer-time, o'er-spreads and embeds every vestige of the city, guessed alone, stock or stone— where a multitude of men breathed joy and woe long ago; lust of glory pricked their hearts up, dread of shame struck them tame; and that glory and that shame alike, the gold bought and sold.  now—the single little turret that remains on the plains, by the caper overrooted, by the gourd overscored, while the patching houseleek's head of blossom winks through the chinks— marks the basement whence a tower in ancient time sprang sublime, and a burning ring, all round, the chariots traced as they raced, and the monarch and his minions and his dames viewed the games.  and i know, while thus the quiet-coloured eve smiles to leave to their folding, all our many-tinkling fleece in such peace, and the slopes and rills in undistinguished grey melt away— that a girl with eager eyes and yellow hair waits me there in the turret whence the charioteers caught soul for the goal, when the king looked, where she looks now, breathless, dumb till i come.  but he looked upon the city, every side, far and wide, all the mountains topped with temples, all the glades' colonnades, all the causeys, bridges, aqueducts,—and then all the men! when i do come, she will speak not, she will stand, either hand on my shoulder, give her eyes the first embrace of my face, ere we rush, ere we extinguish sight and speech each on each.  in one year they sent a million fighters forth south and north, and they built their gods a brazen pillar high as the sky yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— gold, of course. o heart! oh blood that freezes, blood that burns! earth's returns for whole centuries of folly, noise and sin! shut them in, with their triumphs and their glories and the rest! love is best.  
NEW POEM
 immortal heat, o let thy greater flame attract the lesser to it; let those fires which shall consume the world first make it tame, and kindle in our hearts such true desires. as may consume our lusts, and make thee way: then shall our hearts pant thee, then shall our brain all her invention on thine altar lay, and there in hymns send back thy fire again. our eyes shall see thee, which before saw dust, dust blown by wit, till that they both were blind: thou shalt recover all thy goods in kind, who wert disseized by usurping lust: all knees shall bow to thee; all wits shall rise, and praise him who did make and mend our eyes.

NEW POEM
 for b. h. i didn’t fall in love. i fell through it:  came out the other side moments later, hands full of matter, waking up from the dream of a bullet tearing through the middle of my body.  i no longer understand anything for longer than a long moment, or the time it takes to receive the shot.  this kind of gravity is like falling through a cloud, forgetting it all, and then being told about it later.on the day you fell through a cloud . . .  it must be true. if it were not, then when did these strands of silver netting attach to my hair?  the problem was finding that you were real and not just a dream of clouds.  if you weren’t real, i would address this letter to one of two entities: myself, or everyone else. the effect would be equivalent.  the act of falling happens in time. that is, it takes long enough for the falling to shear away from the moments before and the moments after, long enough for one to have thought i am falling. i have been falling. i continue to fall.  falling through a ring, in this case, would not mean falling through the center of the annulus—a planet floats there. falling through the ring means falling through the spaces between the objects that together make the ring.  on the way through, clasp your fists around the universe:  nothing but ice-gravel.  but open your hands when you reach the other side. quickly, before it melts.  what did i leave you?  
NEW POEM
 i follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle under your shoulder, lean over your back, breathing into your hair and thinking of nothing. i want to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop and drift away from all of it, our two cars rusting in the parking lot, our families whining like tame geese at feeding time, and all the bosses of the earth cursing the traffic in the morning haze.  they will telephone each other from their sofas and glass desks, with no idea where we could be, unable to picture the dark throat of the saxophone playing upriver, or the fire we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light, having stolen a truckload of roses and thrown them into the sea.

 i, as sinned against as sinning, take small pleasure from the winning of our decades-long guerrilla war. for from my job i've wanted more than victory over one who'd tried to punish me before he died, and now, neither of us dead, we haunt these halls in constant dread of drifting past the other's life while long-term memory is rife with slights that sting like paper cuts. we've occupied our separate ruts yet simmered in a single rage. we've grown absurd in middle age together, and should seek wisdom now together, by ending this row. i therefore decommission you as constant flagship of my rue. below the threshold of my hate you now my good regard may rate. for i have let my anger pass. but, while you're down there, kiss my ass.  
NEW POEM
 this is how it is with me: so strong, i want to draw the egg from your womb and nourish it in my own. i want to mother your child made only of us, of me, you: no borrowed seed from any man. i want to re-fashion the matrix of creation, make a human being from the human love that passes between our bodies. sweetheart, this is how it is: when you emerge from the bedroom in a clean cotton shirt, sleeves pushed back over forearms, scented with cologne from an amber bottle—i want to open my heart, the brightest aching slit of my soul, receive your pearl. i watch your hands, wait for the sign that means you’ll touch me, open me, fill me; wait for that moment when your desire leaps inside me.

 master of the murmuring courts where the shapes of sleep convene!— lo! my spirit here exhorts all the powers of thy demesne for their aid to woo my queen. what reports yield thy jealous courts unseen?  vaporous, unaccountable, dreamland lies forlorn of light, hollow like a breathing shell. ah! that from all dreams i might choose one dream and guide its flight! i know well what her sleep should tell to-night.  there the dreams are multitudes: some that will not wait for sleep, deep within the august woods; some that hum while rest may steep weary labour laid a-heap; interludes, some, of grievous moods that weep.  poets' fancies all are there: there the elf-girls flood with wings valleys full of plaintive air; there breathe perfumes; there in rings whirl the foam-bewildered springs; siren there winds her dizzy hair and sings.  thence the one dream mutually dreamed in bridal unison, less than waking ecstasy; half-formed visions that make moan in the house of birth alone; and what we at death's wicket see, unknown.  but for mine own sleep, it lies in one gracious form's control, fair with honourable eyes, lamps of a translucent soul: o their glance is loftiest dole, sweet and wise, wherein love descries his goal.  reft of her, my dreams are all clammy trance that fears the sky: changing footpaths shift and fall; from polluted coverts nigh, miserable phantoms sigh; quakes the pall, and the funeral goes by.  master, is it soothly said that, as echoes of man's speech far in secret clefts are made, so do all men's bodies reach shadows o'er thy sunken beach,— shape or shade in those halls pourtrayed of each?  ah! might i, by thy good grace groping in the windy stair, (darkness and the breath of space like loud waters everywhere,) meeting mine own image there face to face, send it from that place to her!  nay, not i; but oh! do thou, master, from thy shadowkind call my body's phantom now: bid it bear its face declin'd till its flight her slumbers find, and her brow feel its presence bow like wind.  where in groves the gracile spring trembles, with mute orison confidently strengthening, water's voice and wind's as one shed an echo in the sun. soft as spring, master, bid it sing and moan.  song shall tell how glad and strong is the night she soothes alway; moan shall grieve with that parched tongue of the brazen hours of day: sounds as of the springtide they, moan and song, while the chill months long for may.  not the prayers which with all leave the world's fluent woes prefer,— not the praise the world doth give, dulcet fulsome whisperer;— let it yield my love to her, and achieve strength that shall not grieve or err.  wheresoe'er my dreams befall, both at night-watch, (let it say,) and where round the sundial the reluctant hours of day, heartless, hopeless of their way, rest and call;— there her glance doth fall and stay.  suddenly her face is there: so do mounting vapours wreathe subtle-scented transports where the black firwood sets its teeth. part the boughs and look beneath,— lilies share secret waters there, and breathe.  master, bid my shadow bend whispering thus till birth of light, lest new shapes that sleep may send scatter all its work to flight;— master, master of the night, bid it spend speech, song, prayer, and end aright.  yet, ah me! if at her head there another phantom lean murmuring o'er the fragrant bed,— ah! and if my spirit's queen smile those alien prayers between,— ah! poor shade! shall it strive, or fade unseen?  how should love's own messenger strive with love and be love's foe? master, nay! if thus, in her, sleep a wedded heart should show,— silent let mine image go, its old share of thy spell-bound air to know.  like a vapour wan and mute, like a flame, so let it pass; one low sigh across her lute, one dull breath against her glass; and to my sad soul, alas! one salute cold as when death's foot shall pass.  then, too, let all hopes of mine, all vain hopes by night and day, slowly at thy summoning sign rise up pallid and obey. dreams, if this is thus, were they:— be they thine, and to dreamworld pine away.  yet from old time, life, not death, master, in thy rule is rife: lo! through thee, with mingling breath, adam woke beside his wife. o love bring me so, for strife, force and faith, bring me so not death but life!  yea, to love himself is pour'd this frail song of hope and fear. thou art love, of one accord with kind sleep to bring her near, still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how dear. master, lord, in her name implor'd, o hear!

 there is a strong wall about me to protect me: it is built of the words you have said to me.  there are swords about me to keep me safe: they are the kisses of your lips.  before me goes a shield to guard me from harm: it is the shadow of your arms between me and danger.  all the wishes of my mind know your name, and the white desires of my heart they are acquainted with you. the cry of my body for completeness, that is a cry to you. my blood beats out your name to me, unceasing, pitiless your name, your name.

 in a tavern on the southside of chicago a man sits with his wife. from their corner booth each stares at strangers just beyond the other's shoulder, nodding to the songs of their youth. tonight they will not fight.  thirty years of marriage sits between them like a bomb. the woman shifts then rubs her right wrist as the man recalls the day when they sat on the porch of her parents' home.  even then he could feel the absence of something desired or planned. there was the smell of a freshly tarred driveway, the slow heat, him offering his future to folks he did not know.  and there was the blooming magnolia tree in the distance— its oversized petals like those on the woman's dress, making her belly even larger, her hands disappearing into the folds.  when the last neighbor or friend leaves their booth he stares at her hands, which are now closer to his, remembers that there had always been some joy. leaning closer, he believes he can see their daughter in her eyes.

 my hair, voluminous from sleeping in six different positions, redolent with your scent, helps me recall that last night was indeed real,  that it's possible for a bedspread to spawn a watershed in the membrane that keeps us shut in our own skins, mute without pleasure,  that i didn't just dream you into being. you fit like a fig in the thick of my tongue, give my hands their one true purpose,  find in my shoulder a groove for your head. in a clinch, you're clenched and i'm pinched, we're spooned, forked, wrenched, lynched  in a chestnut by a mob of our own making, only to be resurrected to stage several revivals that arise from slightest touch to thwart  deep sleep with necessities i never knew i knew until meeting you a few days or many distant, voluptuous lifetimes ago.  
NEW POEM
 she is large and matronly and rather dirty, a little sardonic-looking, as if domesticity had driven her to it.  though what she does, except lay four eggs at random in the garden once a year and put up with her husband, i don't know.  she likes to eat. she hurries up, striding reared on long uncanny legs, when food is going. oh yes, she can make haste when she likes.  she snaps the soft bread from my hand in great mouthfuls, opening her rather pretty wedge of an iron, pristine face into an enormously wide-beaked mouth like sudden curved scissors, and gulping at more than she can swallow, and working her thick, soft tongue, and having the bread hanging over her chin.  o mistress, mistress, reptile mistress, your eye is very dark, very bright, and it never softens although you watch.  she knows, she knows well enough to come for food, yet she sees me not; her bright eye sees, but not me, not anything, sightful, sightless, seeing and visionless, reptile mistress.  taking bread in her curved, gaping, toothless mouth, she has no qualm when she catches my finger in her steel overlapping gums, but she hangs on, and my shout and my shrinking are nothing to her, she does not even know she is nipping me with her curved beak. snake-like she draws at my finger, while i drag it in horror away.  mistress, reptile mistress, you are almost too large, i am almost frightened.  he is much smaller, dapper beside her, and ridiculously small.  her laconic eye has an earthy, materialistic look, his, poor darling, is almost fiery.  his wimple, his blunt-prowed face, his low forehead, his skinny neck, his long, scaled, striving legs, so striving, striving, are all more delicate than she, and he has a cruel scar on his shell.  poor darling, biting at her feet, running beside her like a dog, biting her earthy, splay feet, nipping her ankles, which she drags apathetic away, though without retreating into her shell.  agelessly silent, and with a grim, reptile determination, cold, voiceless age-after-age behind him, serpents' long obstinacy of horizontal persistence.  little old man scuffling beside her, bending down, catching his opportunity, parting his steel-trap face, so suddenly, and seizing her scaly ankle, and hanging grimly on, letting go at last as she drags away, and closing his steel-trap face.  his steel-trap, stoic, ageless, handsome face. alas, what a fool he looks in this scuffle.  and how he feels it! the lonely rambler, the stoic, dignified stalker through chaos, the immune, the animate, enveloped in isolation, forerunner. now look at him!  alas, the spear is through the side of his isolation. his adolescence saw him crucified into sex, doomed, in the long crucifixion of desire, to seek his consummation beyond himself. divided into passionate duality, he, so finished and immune, now broken into desirous fragmentariness, doomed to make an intolerable fool of himself in his effort toward completion again.  poor little earthy house-inhabiting osiris, the mysterious bull tore him at adolescence into pieces, and he must struggle after reconstruction, ignominiously.  and so behold him following the tail of that mud-hovel of his slowly-rambling spouse, like some unhappy bull at the tail of a cow, but with more than bovine, grim, earth-dank persistence, suddenly seizing the ugly ankle as she stretches out to walk, roaming over the sods, or, if it happen to show, at her pointed, heavy tail beneath the low-dropping back-board of her shell.  their two shells like domed boats bumping, hers huge, his small; their splay feet rambling and rowing like paddles, and stumbling mixed up in one another, in the race of love — two tortoises, she huge, he small.  she seems earthily apathetic, and he has a reptile's awful persistence.  i heard a woman pitying her, pitying the mère tortue. while i, i pity monsieur. "he pesters her and torments her," said the woman. how much more is he pestered and tormented, say i.  what can he do? he is dumb, he is visionless, conceptionless. his black, sad-lidded eye sees but beholds not as her earthen mound moves on, but he catches the folds of vulnerable, leathery skin, nail-studded, that shake beneath her shell, and drags at these with his beak, drags and drags and bites, while she pulls herself free, and rows her dull mound along.

 an attempt to explain the former changes of the earth's surface by causes now in operation —subtitle of lyell: principles of geology  the mountain road ends here, broken away in the chasm where the bridge washed out years ago. the first scarlet larkspur glitters in the first patch of april morning sunlight. the engorged creek roars and rustles like a military ball. here by the waterfall, insuperable life, flushed with the equinox, sentient and sentimental, falls away to the sea and death. the tissue of sympathy and agony that binds the flesh in its nessus' shirt; the clotted cobweb of unself and self; sheds itself and flecks the sun's bed with darts of blossom like flagellant blood above the water bursting in the vibrant air. this ego, bound by personal tragedy and the vast impersonal vindictiveness of the ruined and ruining world, pauses in this immortality, as passionate, as apathetic, as the lava flow that burned here once; and stopped here; and said, 'this far and no further.' and spoke thereafter in the simple diction of stone.  naked in the warm april air, we lie under the redwoods, in the sunny lee of a cliff. as you kneel above me i see tiny red marks on your flanks like bites, where the redwood cones have pressed into your flesh. you can find just the same marks in the lignite in the cliff over our heads.sequoia langsdorfii

 before anything could happen, flecks of real gold on her mouth, her eyes more convex than any others, the ground spoke, the barrier of lilacs spoke. what sang in the black tree was entirely gold. her chair was empty.  new absence is a great figure dark as the underskin of fruit. at the center of the earth it surrounds and amplifies the dead whose music never slows down.  she came by car. i came by train. we embraced. it was at the foot of a hill steeply crowned with apples and a ruined fortress. imagination did not make the world.  sweetness is the entire portion. before anything could happen, happiness, the necessary precondition of the world, spoke and flowered over the hill.  when i was in hell on the ruined palisade, either mystery or loneliness kissed my open eyes.  it felt hugely convex, seeing and immediately forgetting.  by contrast, what i imagined later was nothing.

NEW POEM
 here, in the darkness, where this plaster saint stands nearer than god stands to our distress, and one small candle shines, but not so faint as the far lights of everlastingness, i’d rather kneel than over there, in open day where christ is hanging, rather pray to something more like my own clay, not too divine; for, once, perhaps my little saint before he got his niche and crown, had one short stroll about the town; it brings him closer, just that taint— and anyone can wash the paint off our poor faces, his and mine!  is that why i see monty now? equal to any saint, poor boy, as good as gold, but still, with just the proper trace of earthliness on his shining wedding face; and then gone suddenly blank and old the hateful day of the divorce: stuart got his, hands down, of course crowing like twenty cocks and grinning like a horse: but monty took it hard. all said and done i liked him best,— he was the first, he stands out clearer than the rest. it seems too funny all we other rips should have immortal souls; monty and redge quite damnably keep theirs afloat while we go down like scuttled ships.— it’s funny too, how easily we sink, one might put up a monument, i think to half the world and cut across it “lost at sea!” i should drown jim, poor little sparrow, if i netted him to-night— no, it’s no use this penny light— or my poor saint with his tin-pot crown— the trees of calvary are where they were, when we are sure that we can spare the tallest, let us go and strike it down and leave the other two still standing there. i, too, would ask him to remember me if there were any paradise beyond this earth that i could see. oh! quiet christ who never knew the poisonous fangs that bite us through and make us do the things we do, see how we suffer and fight and die, how helpless and how low we lie, god holds you, and you hang so high, though no one looking long at you, can think you do not suffer too, but, up there, from your still, star-lighted tree what can you know, what can you really see of this dark ditch, the soul of me!  we are what we are: when i was half a child i could not sit watching black shadows on green lawns and red carnations burning in the sun, without paying so heavily for it that joy and pain, like any mother and her unborn child were almost one. i could hardly bear the dreams upon the eyes of white geraniums in the dusk, the thick, close voice of musk, the jessamine music on the thin night air, or, sometimes, my own hands about me anywhere — the sight of my own face (for it was lovely then) even the scent of my own hair, oh! there was nothing, nothing that did not sweep to the high seat of laughing gods, and then blow down and beat my soul into the highway dust, as hoofs do the dropped roses of the street. i think my body was my soul, and when we are made thus who shall control our hands, our eyes, the wandering passion of our feet, who shall teach us to thrust the world out of our heart: to say, till perhaps in death, when the race is run, and it is forced from us with our last breath “thy will be done”? if it is your will that we should be content with the tame, bloodless things. as pale as angels smirking by, with folded wings— oh! i know virtue, and the peace it brings! the temperate, well-worn smile the one man gives you, when you are evermore his own: and afterwards the child’s, for a little while, with its unknowing and all-seeing eyes so soon to change, and make you feel how quick the clock goes round. if one had learned the trick— (how does one though?) quite early on, of long green pastures under placid skies, one might be walking now with patient truth. what did we ever care for it, who have asked for youth, when, oh! my god! this is going or has gone?  there is a portrait of my mother, at nineteen, with the black spaniel, standing by the garden seat, the dainty head held high against the painted green and throwing out the youngest smile, shy, but half haughty and half sweet. her picture then: but simply youth, or simply spring to me to-day: a radiance on the wall, so exquisite, so heart-breaking a thing beside the mask that i remember, shrunk and small, sapless and lined like a dead leaf, all that was left of oh! the loveliest face, by time and grief!  and in the glass, last night, i saw a ghost behind my chair— yet why remember it, when one can still go moderately gay—? or could—with any one of the old crew, but oh! these boys! the solemn way they take you and the things they say— this “i have only as long as you” when you remind them you are not precisely twenty-two— although at heart perhaps—god! if it were only the face, only the hair! if jim had written to me as he did to-day a year ago—and now it leaves me cold— i know what this means, old, old,old: et avec ça—mais on a vécu, tout se paie.  that is not always true: there was my mother (well at least the dead are free!) yoked to the man that father was; yoked to the woman i am, monty too; the little portress at the convent school, stewing in hell so patiently; the poor, fair boy who shot himself at aix. and what of me—and what of me ? but i, i paid for what i had, and they for nothing. no, one cannot see how it shall be made up to them in some serene eternity. if there were fifty heavens god could not give us back the child who went or never came; here, on our little patch of this great earth, the sun of any darkened day. not one of all the starry buds hung on the hawthorn trees of last year’s may, no shadow from the sloping fields of yesterday; for every hour they slant across the hedge a different way, the shadows are never the same.  “find rest in him” one knows the parsons’ tags— back to the fold, across the evening fields, like any flock of baa-ing sheep: yes, it may be, when he has shorn, led us to slaughter, torn the bleating soul in us to rags, for so he giveth his belovèd sleep. oh! he will take us stripped and done, driven into his heart. so we are won: then safe, safe are we? in the shelter of his everlasting wings— i do not envy him his victories, his arms are full of broken things.  but i shall not be in them. let him take the finer ones, the easier to break. and they are not gone, yet, for me, the lights, the colours, the perfumes, though now they speak rather in sumptuous rooms. in silks and in gemlike wines; here, even, in this corner where my little candle shines and overhead the lancet-window glows with golds and crimsons you could almost drink to know how jewels taste, just as i used to think there was the scent in every red and yellow rose of all the sunsets. but this place is grey, and much too quiet. no one here, why, this is awful, this is fear! nothing to see, no face. nothing to hear except your heart beating in space as if the world was ended. dead at last! dead soul, dead body, tied together fast. these to go on with and alone, to the slow end: no one to sit with, really, or to speak to, friend to friend: out of the long procession, black or white or red not one left now to say “still i am here, then see you, dear, lay here your head”. only the doll’s house looking on the park to-night, all nights, i know, when the man puts the lights out, very dark. with, upstairs, in the blue and gold box of a room, just the maids' footsteps overhead, then utter silence and the empty world—the room—the bed— the corpse! no, not quite dead, while this cries out in me. but nearly: very soon to be a handful of forgotten dust— there must be someone. christ! there must, tell me there will be someone. who? if there were no one else, could it be you?  how old was mary out of whom you cast so many devils? was she young or perhaps for years she had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past till suddenly she saw you on the steps of simon’s house and stood and looked at you through tears. i think she must have known by those the thing, for what it was that had come to her. for some of us there is a passion, i suppose, so far from earthly cares and earthly fears that in its stillness you can hardly stir or in its nearness, lift your hand, so great that you have simply got to stand looking at it through tears, through tears. then straight from these there broke the kiss, i think you must have known by this the thing, for what it was, that had come to you: she did not love you like the rest, it was in her own way, but at the worst, the best, she gave you something altogether new. and through it all, from her, no word, she scarcely saw you, scarcely heard: surely you knew when she so touched you with her hair, or by the wet cheek lying there, and while her perfume clung to you from head to feet all through the day that you can change the things for which we care, but even you, unless you kill us, not the way.  this, then was peace for her, but passion too. i wonder was it like a kiss that once i knew, the only one that i would care to take into the grave with me, to which if there were afterwards, to wake. almost as happy as the carven dead in some dim chancel lying head by head we slept with it, but face to face, the whole night through— one breath, one throbbing quietness, as if the thing behind our lips was endless life, lost, as i woke, to hear in the strange earthly dawn, his “are you there?” and lie still, listening to the wind outside, among the firs.  so mary chose the dream of him for what was left to her of night and day, it is the only truth: it is the dream in us that neither life nor death nor any other thing can take away: but if she had not touched him in the doorway of the dream could she have cared so much ? she was a sinner, we are what we are: the spirit afterwards, but first the touch.  and he has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees of eden and calvary, with its ghosts that have not any eyes for tears, and the happier guests who would not see, or if they did, remember these, though they lived there a thousand years. outside, too gravely looking at me. he seems to stand, and looking at him, if my forgotten spirit came unwillingly back, what could it claim of those calm eyes, that quiet speech, breaking like a slow tide upon the beach, the scarred, not quite human hand ?— unwillingly back to the burden of old imaginings when it has learned so long not to think, not to be, again, again it would speak as it has spoken to me of things that i shall not see!  i cannot bear to look at this divinely bent and gracious head: when i was small i never quite believed that he was dead: and at the convent school i used to lie awake in bed thinking about his hands. it did not matter what they said, he was alive to me, so hurt, so hurt! and most of all in holy week when there was no one else to see i used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly, if he had ever seemed to notice me or, if, for once, he would only speak.  
NEW POEM
 after jim steinmeyer’s book “hiding the elephant: how magicians invented the impossible and learned to disappear” over the years they hunted, the wayward apprentice watchmakers, the disappointing sons who transformed their surnames, hunted over acres of hinges, cogs, calluses, hidden whiskey, mustaches a breath from feral, poured an ocean of fortune into fabrications of brass and iron, spent entire seasons strumming massive harps of wire into perfect calibrations of invisibility, prayed to the gods of adjustable mirrors, cursed the gods of temperamental gaslights, broke the legs of imitators and thieves, chewed holes in each other’s pockets, harnessed nightmares of giant silver hoops making endless passes over the bodies of the dead, hoisted high a cenotaph for hundreds of sacrificed rabbits, breathed miles of delicate thread into the lost labyrinths of their lungs, all to make a woman float to make a woman float and none of them ever thought of simply asking her.  
NEW POEM
 on turning forty they draw me closer like the hands of one grandmother i kissed upon visiting her in the barrio. the magnets make me look at my waist, wondering why the ache is in the street, houses giving off stinking air, a magnetic field collecting old newspapers, broken-down cars, alleys where the drummer cowers before he beats on his bag of beer cans.  i visit the irrigation canal that churns green and flows beyond the streets, wait for the alligator to swim by, the one released from the plaza long ago. i feel the pull toward the mongrel dog, the clicking of the magnets in the church, an attraction for open doorways.  *  i remove the magnet from my neck, a medal of a denied saint. i will never witness the migration of bats again, stand at the entrance of the caverns as bats shoot out of the opening, the evening bristling with their intelligence.  the sky bruises against the horizon of yucca plants erect as magnets surrrounding the cavern, miles of yucca encircling the poles to protect them from the wind that pulls me into the hole.  *  he tells me to believe what i have seen, insists magnetic force comes from the blade, the woman wanting us to keep something for her. he says magnets are missing metals from an underground wound, a husband’s wrist broken by a slammed car hood, loyal dance of an old couple watching the street.  he says tortillas and menudo attract flies. he learned red chili kills all life, insists magnets let him sleep fulfilled, delicious food he fixes long after his wife has died.  he cries that the magnets get stronger when he peels the pods to find no difference in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love.  *  i climb the rocks because the minerals are there, ascend to where i buried the seashell, rusted can, and pencil twenty-eight years ago. i reach the rocks because i am allowed one mountain, climbing to readjust the magnets. then, i stand and look down.  i clear my chest of a fist encountered up here, set my foot on the humming slab. i move to survive when i touch my heart. i climb higher before deciding to bend and dig.  
NEW POEM
 from the third floor window you watch the mailman’s slow progress through the blowing snow. as he goes from door to door  he might be searching for a room to rent, unsure of the address, which he keeps stopping to check  in the outdated and now obliterated clipping he holds, between thickly gloved fingers, close to his eyes  in a hunched and abruptly simian posture that makes you turn away, quickly switching off the lamp.  
NEW POEM
 about the shark, phlegmatical one, pale sot of the maldive sea, the sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim, how alert in attendance be. from his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw they have nothing of harm to dread, but liquidly glide on his ghastly flank or before his gorgonian head; or lurk in the port of serrated teeth in white triple tiers of glittering gates, and there find a haven when peril’s abroad, an asylum in jaws of the fates! they are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey, yet never partake of the treat— eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull, pale ravener of horrible meat.

NEW POEM
 the man moves earth to dispel grief. he digs holes the size of cars. in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— rain-swollen ponds and dirt mounds rooted with flame-tipped flowers. he carries trees like children struggling to be set down. trees that have lived out their lives, he cuts and stacks like loaves of bread which he will feed the fire. the green smoke sweetens his house.  the woman sweeps air to banish sadness. she dusts floors, polishes objects made of clay and wood. in proportion to what is taken what is given multiplies— the task of something else to clean. gleaming appliances beg to be smudged, breathed upon by small children and large animals flicking out hope as she whirls by, flap of tongue, scratch of paw, sweetly reminding her.  the man moves earth, the woman sweeps air. together they pull water out of the other, pull with the muscular ache of the living, hauling from the deep well of the body the rain-swollen, the flame-tipped, the milk-fed— all that cycles through lives moving, lives sweeping, water circulating between them like breath, drawn out of leaves by light.  
NEW POEM
 the man splitting wood in the daybreak looks strong, as though, if one weakened, one could turn to him and he would help. gus newland was strong. when he split wood he struck hard, flashing the bright steel through the air so hard the hard maple leapt apart, as it’s feared marriages will do in countries reluctant to permit divorce, and even willow, which, though stacked to dry a full year, on being split actually weeps—totem wood, therefore, to the married-until-death—sunders with many little lip-wetting gasp-noises. but gus is dead. we could turn to our fathers, but they help us only by the unperplexed looking-back of the numerals cut into headstones. or to our mothers, whose love, so devastated, can’t, even in spring, break through the hard earth. our spouses weaken at the same rate we do. we have to hold our children up to lean on them. everyone who could help goes or hasn’t arrived. what about the man splitting wood in the daybreak, who looked strong? that was years ago. that was me.  
NEW POEM
 the old russian spits up a plum fruit of the rasping sound he has stored in his throat all these lonely years  made in fact lonely by his wife who left him, god knows without knowing how to cook for himself.  he examines the plum notes its purplish consistency almost the color and shape of her buttocks whose circulation was bad  which is why he himself wears a beret: black, good wool, certainly warm enough the times he remembers.  he shoots the plum to the ground like a child whose confidence is a game of marbles  whose flick of a thumb is a smile inside his mouth knowing what he knows will happen.  but his wife, marthe does not spill out when the plum breaks open.  instead, it is a younger self alive and waving just the size he remembers himself to have been.  the old russian puts him onto his finger like a parakeet and sits him on the shelf with the pictures.  for the rest of his days he nags himself constantly into a half-sleep surprised by this turn of events.

 dear sir, your air of authority leaves me lost. eases me from a place of ease. contracts with my contradictions to take from me a place. autopilots my autobiography. frightens my fright. sighs with my breath. wins at my race. your certainty has me curtained. your nerve has me nervous. your childhood has me childlike and your nastiness nests in my belfry like a hawk. you are beyond and above my slice of sky, peach as a pie, bourbon as its pit. you are spit and vinegar while i sour in my bowl. you bowl me over while i tread lightly on my feet. you walk on water while i sink. you witness me, fisherman, boat on the lake, while i struggle and burble and brittle and drop. you wink at me and i must relate. i close my eyes to erase you and you are written in my lids. a litmus test. a form of lair. god with three days of facial growth and an old bouquet for a face. soap and water for a brain. i have no handsome answer. i have no pillar of salt or shoulder to look over. i have no feather to weigh. i have no bubble to burst. i am less to myself, a character in a drama, a drumbeat, a benevolence, a blight. all parts of me say shoot on sight. aim for an artery or organ. good night.

 if i die, you say you will let your hair turn silver, grow long, and you will go into the dark place, for you’ve already begun to forget what mecca means.  where we come from, you and i, maqam means home, means music; the qur’an can only be read as a song; a sheikh recites the fatiha as if he has built a house among the lines, the ayas.  we’ve both called our daughters aya, and when they ask about their name, we play holy verses for them, listen to how the sheikh lingers long enough on each letter, how the audience claps and whistles —is it umm kulthum?  our daughters ask. he knows all his maqamat, this sheikh, says god is greater, and allah, allah, reply the faithful and the unfaithful alike, for the earth is such a small planet, and look,  there is ithaca, almost always on the horizon — float, my friend. ithaca —it is rough, but raises good men, says homer, but oh, the women, the women know how to house the bodies of the drowned. they sing,  in the name of the cross, of god, the merciful. a child in syria has amputated legs because he has ventured into a minefield to eat grass. he still has two eyes, two arms, a mouth.god is greater, is greater, stay  with me in the light a little longer. you light two cigarettes at the same time, give me one. tomorrow you will fly to lesbos to translate. the refugees will say shai, and you will say tea, home, mecca, ithaca, maqam, maqam, maqam.

 years later they find themselves talking about chances, moments when their lives might have swerved off for the smallest reason. what if i hadn’t phoned, he says, that morning? what if you’d been out, as you were when i tried three times the night before? then she tells him a secret. she’d been there all evening, and she knew he was the one calling, which was why she hadn’t answered. because she felt— because she was certain—her life would change if she picked up the phone, said hello, said, i was just thinking of you. i was afraid, she tells him. and in the morning i also knew it was you, but i just answered the phone the way anyone answers a phone when it starts to ring, not thinking you have a choice.  
NEW POEM
 we communicated by cheeses, unwrapping them gingerly, parting the crust with a fork, tasting dew, must, salt, raising an eyebrow,  or we let chianti talk for us, rolling it in the glass, staring—it was dark and shiny as the pupil, and stared back— or we undressed each other;  we took long walks hand in hand in the vineyards, the pastures, resenting each other bitterly for our happiness that excluded us as surely as the world did, mountain after mountain.

 the time of breathing into clasped hands hovering over a lighter to make a flame  not knowing that an angry man threw his eyes into the night  the belly of his shattered father weeping rain for separation of earth and sky  harvesting bitter grudges from minds like hardened soil  packing up the wounds with mud and whiskey and opening doors to wait  for those curious to know how sky maps granted our existence  how the weight of earth pushed against tongues of oars  and our tīpuna pushed back and won.

 in the warmth of night i put feet to my plan: waited for my brothers to sleep. they’d spent the day sharpening their hooks, repairing the great net, filling gourds with fresh water. they’d bundled taro wrapped in leaves sitting below the cross seats. the bundles and the net would cover me, especially if i said the chant to slow my movement and my breathing. the moon became brighter like a big fish eye as the chant hooked me.  i was holding my grandmother’s hook so tightly a little cut welled red between my closed knuckles. “goodmorning, brothers,” i called and they cussed and moaned until the next chant took us a further hundred miles and then another until my chanting made them gasp as we settled on a patch of ocean black with fish. they forgave me, not that it matters. i took the bloody hook and said my business to the ocean. it worked. the fish rose and our descent was secured.  
NEW POEM
 march 10th and the snow flees like eloping brides into rain. the imperceptible change begins out of an old rage and glistens, chaste, with its new craving, spring. may your desire always overcome  your need; your story that you have to tell, enchanting, mutable, may it fill the world you believe: a sunny view, flowers lunging from the sill, the quilt, the chair, all things  fill with you and empty and fill. and hurry, because now as i tire of my studied abandon, counting the days, i’m sad. yet i trust your absence, in everything wholly evident: the rain in the white basin, and i  vigilant.  
NEW POEM
 if we could only push these walls apart, unfold the room the way a child might take apart a box and lay it flat upon the floor— so many corners cleared at last! or else could rip away the roof and stare down at the dirty rooms, the hallways turning on themselves, and understand at last their plan— dark maze without a minotaur, no monsters but ourselves. yet who could bear to see it all? the slow descending spirals of the dust against the spotted windowpane, the sunlight on the yellow lace, the hoarded wine turned dark and sour, the photographs, the letters—all the crowded closets of the heart.  one wants to turn away—and cry for fire to break out on the stairs and raze each suffocating room. but the walls stay, the roof remains strong and immovable, and we can only pray that if these rooms have memories, they are not ours.

 humbling of bhutto in mecca, bhutto kissing hajar-e-aswad, half the bhutto cabinet in ihram, kneeling. these were the first scenes, in the rolling newsreel of half-closed doors, of the doorjamb  in the way of the twentieth century’s upstarts. a nationalization, by bhutto, of religious piety? no, but a headlong scram into obeisance of all and everybody and everything to the stately  rise of islam in the neighboring, overbearing arabia. that year bhutto had appointed my father hajj secretary, and we, the seven children and the ayah, were present at melody cinema in full regalia  to see, to our amazement, on the screen, our father in ihram like bhutto, and in a tent in mina, sitting on the ground in an ablution scene, the humbling of our mysophobic mother,  who before her pilgrimage would have drunk water only from a glass washed three times by a servant and who wouldn't sit on the drawing-room sofa unless it was draped by a freshly laundered sheet.

NEW POEM
 it is easily forgotten, year to year, exactly where the plot is, though the place is entirely familiar— a willow tree by a curving roadway sweeping black asphalt with tender leaves;  damp grass strewn with flower boxes, canvas chairs, darkskinned old ladies circling in draped black crepe family stones, fingers cramped red at the knuckles, discolored nails, fresh soil for new plants, old rosaries;  such fingers kneading the damp earth gently down on new roots, black humus caught in grey hair brushed back, and the single waterfaucet, birdlike upon its grey pipe stem, a stream opening at its foot.  we know the stories that are told, by starts and stops, by bent men at strange joy regarding the precise enactments of their own gesturing. and among the women there will be a naming of families, a counting off, an ordering.  the morning may be brilliant; the season is one of brilliances—sunlight through the fountained willow behind us, its splayed shadow spreading westward, our shadows westward, irregular across damp grass, the close-set stones.  it may be that since our walk there is faltering, moving in careful steps around snow-on-the-mountain, bluebells and zebragrass toward that place between the willow and the waterfaucet, the way is lost, that we have no practiced step there, and walking, our own sway and balance, fails us.  
NEW POEM
 all that's left is the shroud the back wings. roaches scurrying in the kitchen. there’s no greater threat than this time at hand. drunken cackles from the street. still damp from 4 am rain. i missed the instructions for this part. the trap. the deflate of dream. utopia was always supposed to be right at hand. right and left. any which way we’d make of it.   marine layer won’t budge for the rumble under our feet. sky tears open in the north. sirens on high. a small pool forms in the buckle of asphalt. in its gentle tremble the reflection of the grey white mass overhead with a perfect seam of blue. the rift where the dead speak how-tos.  
NEW POEM
 we spend our morning in the flower stalls counting the dark tongues of bells that hang from ropes waiting for the silence of an hour. we find a table, ask for paella, cold soup and wine, where a calm light trembles years behind us.  in buenos aires only three years ago, it was the last time his hand slipped into her dress, with pearls cooling her throat and bells like these, chipping at the night—  as she talks, the hollow clopping of a horse, the sound of bones touched together. the paella comes, a bed of rice and camarones, fingers and shells, the lips of those whose lips have been removed, mussels the soft blue of a leg socket.  this is not paella, this is what has become of those who remained in buenos aires. this is the ring of a rifle report on the stones, her hand over her mouth, her husband falling against her.  these are the flowers we bought this morning, the dahlias tossed on his grave and bells waiting with their tongues cut out for this particular silence.  
NEW POEM
 the ones his age who shook my hand on their way out sent fear along my arm like heroin. these weren’t men mute about their feelings, or what’s a body language for?  and i, the glib one, who’d stood with my back to my father’s body and praised the heart that attacked him? i’d made my stab at elegy, the flesh made word: the very spit  in my mouth was sour with ruth and eloquence. what could be worse? silence, the anthem of my father’s new country. and thus this babble, like a dial tone, from our bodies.

 on the radio this morning: the average woman knows 275 colors—and men know eight. women say coffee, mocha, copper, cinnamon, taupe . men say brown.  women know an amazon of colors i might have said were green, an antarctica of whites, oceans of colors i'd stupidly call blue, fields of color, with flowers in them i would have said were red.  from women, i've learned to love the browns, the earths, the dusts, the clays, the soft colors, the colors brought out from the mines, hardened ones, hardened in fires i would call red; the colors of the furies; the reconciling colors of the cooling ash.  by myself i know the evening colors when the sky goes from blue to another blue to black—although it's a lonely, whitish black sometimes, like the color of sleep— the way dreams are lit by the light that's thrown from nowhere on the things you find in them. last night there was a turtle, i would say it was brown or green, or it was a snake, mottled, a kind of grey, disguised as a turtle, red spots as if painted on the shell, a palish greenish underside—vulnerable, alone swimming in water i would say was colorless.  i woke to the pale colors of the morning—no one has a name for those: the white-rose white you see through the white of the curtains on the window, the milks, the creams, the cream a galactic swirl before it turns to brown when your wife stirs it in the coffee, the faint drying oval on the silver of the spoon.

 the spell is a mouth’s perilous-o as they dark circle the boats in their most resplendent pliable armor.  the concept fish aligning with girl or love with death to bring down men at sea,temptation  confused into offering, the mismatch of like plus unlike really likes, straight to rock bottom.  no equation has ever been this badass. it’s the men who will enter the spell so far into exhaustion as weather, as waves,  the tide pulling toward if, letting go then over the whale road in the company of the dolphin, the only other animal, i’m told,  who can do it solely for pleasure. it. you know what i mean. the lower half aglitter, the top half brainy as beautiful  is sometimes, murderous lovelies, their plotting and resolve and why not get these guys good, the lechers.  to see at all in the whirling, to hear what anyone might in wind roar and faint whistle —  don’t worry about girls shrewd as whimsy, legend-tough to the core. don’t. but it’s  their spell too, isn’t it? locked there. aligned with singing, dazzle razor-blackened green. not that they  miss what human is like or know any end to waters half born to, from where they look up.  men in boats, so sick of the journey. men gone stupid with blue, with vast, with gazing over and away  the whole time until same to same-old to now they’re mean. after that, small. out there, the expanse. in here,  the expanse. the men look down. aching misalignment — gorgeous lure that hides its hook steely sweet  to o my god, little fool’s breath triumphant, all the way under and am i not deserving?

 intractable between them grows a garden of barbed wire and roses. burning briars like flames devour their too innocent attire. dare they meet, the blackened wire tears the intervening air.  trespassers have wandered through texture of flesh and petals. dogs like arrows moved along pathways that their noses knew. while the two who laid it out find the metal and the flower fatal underfoot.  black and white at midnight glows this garden of barbed wire and roses. doused with darkness roses burn coolly as a rainy moon: beneath a rainy moon or none silver the sheath on barb and thorn.  change the garden, scale and plan; wall it, make it annual. there the briary flower grew. there the brambled wire ran. while they sleep the garden grows, deepest wish annuls the will: perfect still the wire and rose.

 out of the golden west, out of the leaden east, into the iron south, and to the silver north . . . oh metals metals everywhere, forks and knives, belt buckles and hooks . . . when you are beaten you sing. you do not give anyone a chance . . .  you come out of the earth and fly with men. you lodge in men. you hurt them terribly. you tear them. you do not care for anyone.  oh metals metals, why are you always hanging about? is it not enough that you hold men’s wrists? is it not enough that we let you in our mouths?  why is it you will not do anything for yourself? why is it you always wait for men to show you what to be?  and men love you. perhaps it is because you soften so often. you did, it is true, pour into anything men asked you to. it has always proved you to be somewhat softer than you really are.  oh metals metals, why are you always filling my house? you are like family, you do not care for anyone.

NEW POEM
 this guy i know, a rabbi, friday nights, on his way home before sunset in winter, always stops at a florist or bodega and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife.  every week the same, a ritual, regardless of her mood that morning, fresh upsets at work, or snarling on the bridge; he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane.  but isn’t there a ring of hokiness in that? why should a good man have to show his devotion? some things go unspoken; some things get tested on the real world,  and isn’t that the place that matters most? so when you told me i should bring you flowers, i joked, “but don’t i show my feelings more in dog walks, diapers, and rewiring lamps?”  the flowers, i learned later, weren’t for wooing, not for affection in long marriage, but for something seeded even deeper down, through frost heaves, and which might be, roughly, peace.  (it’s funny that i just assumed romance.) now there’s no peace with us. i wonder what they might have meant to you, those simple tokens, holding in sight what no rite can grow back.  
NEW POEM
 when the mink ran across the meadow in bunched black parabolas, i thought sine and cosine, but no — the movement never dips below the line. the creature vanished into barberries. absolute predator who cracks a rabbit’s spine in one bite. and my mind  leapt along a track to a summer field where i walked years ago to a stony spit out into the north atlantic with a young man i hardly knew, and his sister. he was bald, dying of a brain tumor. i ignored his illness and we spoke of history. he was gentle, scholarly. why  do i remember him when it was his sister i painted seated in tall grass, her forehead wide, brown hair framing her face, ocean a cobalt swatch behind? islands humped in little arcs across the bay. that canvas is stacked in a closet. but it’s the dead boy i’ve stored inside me all these years,  scared of the otherworldly light around his eyes. scared and ashamed of what i didn’t know. ashamed of my fear that made his death, when it came, unspeakable. so history bounds into the present, glitter-eyed, with musky anal glands and daggering eyeteeth. because that boy wasn’t dead: he must be killed again.

 i.  dusk, thus: a shirt drops,  the bellybutton rune showing.  clouds are soaked, the sea now  iron, muscle-heavy. the pond begins  reflecting on astronomy. the fruit wait.  the furniture call back their atoms.  the tree asks for its leaves.   ii.  winter brought into the room is the whisk of holly.  the purse is a hare limp on the table, its eye gone amber.  the birdcage is the work i am after: bold-barred, so no bird leaves.  the celadon throat, the iceberg teeth, the matted grass of an armpit . . .  a pear, or maybe a stone, the chilled shoulder shifts under cover, not persuaded into similitude.   iii.  in the snail-tracked sky, the mineral grains, a dozen eyes.  you tell me thread is for seam and hem, not the mica bead-stitched on the dark.  you refuse to have the shards the broom gathered be the moon, seen as aftermath.  but like the thimble, i have no guile.  so let your window open to the rain coming down, drumming on the hidden shells.   iv.  black cherries. glass of milk on a tablecloth. an arm of bread.  the coins. green scarab beetle. the compact’s sleeping mirror.  the fig branch. the sundial. the harlequin leaves.   v.  votive-light evening, cipher ridden.  the marsh air, and my finger in places.  among the lesser constellations, the fractured  kite, the anemone. the geese thread-pulled  into the hard sleep. the clothespin, the gold  in your hair. the seeds spread  are a flung field. i sleep on stone, you on moss.   vi.  the red-haired figure in the station, the man selling carnations. the scarecrow  landscape, the suitcases getting heavier with every stop. those served as props.  i dreamed we each played a part.  one of us was given to say: i wanted your distance whispered down small enough for this room.  and one to say: i saw you always just a little out of reach, with white hair.   vii.  a fish-scale moon: who doesn’t want  to be left used windsock-hollow?  now for morning: the lit wick  of each grass-blade, the saplings  like legs of deer, the four walls  verifying the house, and the slip  of last night’s chive in your teeth.

 a tiny blue metal race car grandma gave to me when i was 32.  there’s an obelisk now in skeleton canyon. maybe you’re too close to the speaker. tell the arthur lee of love confrontation story. the tender does not approve of our vulgarity. double vocal for airports, weekends and holidays. numb grids that represent human inaction. an incidental arrival? why that landing? the speaker of the poem seems baffled to be in his/her time continuum. blind willie mctell, blind willie johnson, playing together on the street corner. turn down the harp and make it feel more distant. the next few minutes could hardly be identified as words. a few fireman later, the benefit of a lifelong love was clear. a locus of abnormal sensation. harder to keep an indiscriminate man from slaughter. off state extemporaneous crushed weight. consulting the at-bats for ideas of speed. i will be home when my shirt is too dirty to wear.

 to have known him, to have loved him after loneness long; and then to be estranged in life, and neither in the wrong; and now for death to set his seal— ease me, a little ease, my song! by wintry hills his hermit-mound the sheeted snow-drifts drape, and houseless there the snow-bird flits beneath the fir-trees’ crape: glazed now with ice the cloistral vine that hid the shyest grape.

 “if you work a body of water and a body of woman you can take fish out of one and children out of the other for the two kinds of survival. the fishing is good, both kinds are adequate in pleasures and yield, but the hard work and the miseries are killing; it is a good life if life is good. if not, not. you are out in the world and in in the world, having it both ways: it is sportive and prevenient living combined, although you have to think about the weathers and the hard work and the miseries are what i said. it runs on like water, quickly, under the boat, then slowly like the sand dunes under the house. you survive by yourself by the one fish for a while and then by the other afterward when you run out. you run out a hooky life baited with good times, and whether the catch is caught or not is a question for those who go fishing for men or among them for things.”

 when you walked in it was like recognizing  the moon when he returns. his lover bites his cheek; she  has no choice. all we see is the dissolution, then await  the reconstruction. each time, the sky  yanks her into his orbit. i want to say i’m sorry.  i want to say you win.our bodies are like  the confessional booth these poems are stuck in. even  the priest can see that sin. you’ll be all spit and honey—  or maybe i’m the poisoned flower gnawing on its own  lip because it has no hands to reach for you. only words  that are as useless as the pollen for saying anything. i continue  to serve them even with your hands around my throat from across  the room. your voice is home, i answer it like a bat guided  across the atmosphere. this is a narrative that cannot end  well but wants to, but must. i’ll continue to go down kicking  and you’ll be sweet as anything until you bite back. no, it can’t  end here—we won’t let it. billions of years have passed  since an asteroid last hit the moon: clearly some  magnetic fields can be sustained.

 (1942)  to denis devlin i   again the native hour lets down the locks uncombed and black, but gray the bobbing beard; ten years ago his eyes, fierce shuttlecocks, pierced the close net of what i failed: i feared the belly-cold, the grave-clout, that betrayed me dithering in the drift of cordial seas; ten years are time enough to be dismayed by mummy christ, head crammed between his knees.  suppose i take an arrogant bomber, stroke by stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear sun-ghostlings whisper: yes, the capital yoke— remove it and there’s not a ghost to fear this crucial day, whose decapitate joke languidly winds into the inner ear.   ii   the day’s at end and there’s nowhere to go, draw to the fire, even this fire is dying; get up and once again politely lying invite the ladies toward the mistletoe with greedy eyes that stare like an old crow. how pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang and how stuffed santa did his reindeer clang above the golden oaken mantel, years ago!   then hang this picture for a calendar, as sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly for the cold martial progress of your star, with thoughts of commerce and society, well-milked chinese, negroes who cannot sing, the huns gelded and feeding in a ring.   iii   give me this day a faith not personal as follows: the american people fully armed with assurance policies, righteous and harmed, battle the world of which they’re not at all. that lying boy of ten who stood in the hall, his hat in hand (thus by his father charmed: “you may be president”), was not alarmed nor even left uneasy by his fall.   nobody said that he could be a plumber, carpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier; let little boys go into violent slumber, aegean squall and squalor where their fear is of an enemy in remote oceans unstalked by christ: these are the better notions.   iv   gay citizen, myself, and thoughtful friend, your ghosts are plato’s christians in the cave. unfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave gives back the cheated and light dividend so long sequestered; now, new-rich, you’ll spend flesh for reality inside a stone whose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone, dead or still living, will not break or bend.   thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister and put off like a dog that’s had his day, you will be plato’s kept philosopher, albino man bleached from the mortal clay, mild-mannered, gifted in your master’s ease while the sun squats upon the waveless seas.

 why do we bother with the rest of the day, the swale of the afternoon, the sudden dip into evening,  then night with his notorious perfumes, his many-pointed stars?  this is the best— throwing off the light covers, feet on the cold floor, and buzzing around the house on espresso—  maybe a splash of water on the face, a palmful of vitamins— but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,  dictionary and atlas open on the rug, the typewriter waiting for the key of the head, a cello on the radio,  and, if necessary, the windows— trees fifty, a hundred years old out there, heavy clouds on the way and the lawn steaming like a horse in the early morning.

 haze. three student violists boarding a bus. a clatter of jackhammers. granular light. a film of sweat for primer and the heat for a coat of paint. a man and a woman on a bench: she tells him he must be psychic, for how else could he sense, even before she knew, that she’d need to call it off? a bicyclist fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle on the boil. i never meant, she says. but i thought, he replies. two cabs almost collide; someone yells fuck in farsi. i’m sorry, she says. the comforts of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon. the sky blurs—there’s a storm coming up or down. a lank cat slinks liquidly around a corner. how familiar it feels to feel strange, hollower than a bassoon. a rill of chill air in the leaves. a car alarm. hail.

 i  “at odds again,” hands moving out of the shadows. and now, now everything seems definite, discrete, fingers webbed with sunlight the tree lets through, arms still in their own time, circling, catch up, catch hold at the wrists, like cell chains in a watchcrystal completing themselves. together again. shoulders, torso, each one of us one, once more. it is hard to imagine minutes just past.   ii  “at odds again,” hands moving against the wind like loose flapping things, washcloths, words long frayed with careless use. you wanted to say it was beginning to bother you, beginning to wish, wondering if thought in broken light could ever touch itself, reassemble itself. the king, our promise, broken, the sword we imagined gone, hovers like leafmold in the light. say it, then, the stain of things remains.   iii  “at odds again,” elbow cupped into wet leaves. after love, there are moments of clutter, and no amount of practice will teach you to regard them as anything more than what you lean against catching its buried chill. keep your fancy to yourself; facts do not fade but are momentarily obscured, the work of hands, touch and its out- come, the absence of touch, and distance, the inevitable space between, shapes all our limitations.   iv  “at odds again,” knee raised slightly, sunlight and shade, patchwork coverlet. bits and pieces, the story of each thing connected, end to end, this instant extended in every direction. not a thing in space or things in spaces or spaces between what space seems occupied for this moment, the next. we are not snowstorms of ourselves, spindrift and curl. the whorl of action is a template in time: the casual shifting of leaves, hands moving, the certain flex of possibility.  
NEW POEM
 this is everything she ever closed a door on, the broom closet of childhood where no one could ever find a broom. here, layer upon layer, nothing breathes: photo albums curl at the edges, books she brought home from the library where she worked, handled by thousands of other hands before their final exile where they’ve waited, paper and more paper taking in the ocean air, about to sprout.  mother’s sitting on the bed with her tattered list of dispersals—who gets what among the treasures she hopes i’ll find, but i know i’m seeing what she doesn't want me to see, the daughter cleaning doing what the son would never do. after an hour of excavation the console tv emerges from beneath forgotten sweaters and balled up nylons saved for stuffing puppets, a long ago church project— the tv arrived in 1966 same day i crushed the fender of the car, upsetting the careful plans she’d made for payment.  she wants to leave so much behind. hours later i’ve found nothing i want but the purple mache mask i made in the fourth grade. i like its yellow eyes. she looks at each magazine i remove, saving every word about my brother, the coach. he’s sixty and a long dead mouse has eaten the laces of his baby shoes. i want order. i say i’m old myself, i’ve started throwing things away. i’m lying. i’ve kept everything she’s ever given me.  
NEW POEM
 adrift in the liberating, late light of august, delicate, frivolous, they make their way to my front porch and flutter near the glassed-in bulb, translucent as a thought suddenly wondered aloud, illumining the air that's thick with honeysuckle and dusk. you and i are doing our best at conversation, keeping it light, steering clear of what we'd like to say. you leave, and the night becomes cluttered with moths, some tattered, their dumbly curious filaments startling against my cheek. how quickly, instinctively, i brush them away. dazed, they cling to the outer darkness like pale reminders of ourselves. others seem to want so desperately to get inside. months later, i'll find the woolens, snug in their resting places, full of missing pieces.  
NEW POEM
 i know a funny little man, as quiet as a mouse, who does the mischief that is done in everybody’s house! there’s no one ever sees his face, and yet we all agree that every plate we break was cracked by mr. nobody.  ’tis he who always tears out books, who leaves the door ajar, he pulls the buttons from our shirts, and scatters pins afar; that squeaking door will always squeak, for prithee, don’t you see, we leave the oiling to be done by mr. nobody.  he puts damp wood upon the fire  that kettles cannot boil;  his are the feet that bring in mud,  and all the carpets soil.  the papers always are mislaid;  who had them last, but he?  there’s no one tosses them about  but mr. nobody.

 god and mrs. god in watercolor blue skirt desolate. — david schubert i am not a woman, i am a man. made in his image. i keep the house, a gray cape cod, and broom it well. i wear a skirt to be comfortable. i build the fire. when my husband comes home i don’t pester him with questions. he knows where to find his slippers and his pipe. out our kitchen back door i see the prophets freight-hopping the long bad western in ancient english that no one need read to know. everyone speaks his part: the women keep their heads down while the men are losing theirs. children? how often i’ve prayed for a child, which means slipping meaning looks to my husband as we rock together on the porch of an evening, drinking lemonade and playing scrabble. if he lets me win it’s a sign. i haven’t won yet. but the neighbor children come and go and take the pies cooling on the windowsill without thanks. sometimes terrible things happen to them — some man spills the blood cradled so carefully in every hand. i accept no blame. the pies were there to leave alone, or not. god says nothing but taps out his pipe, stands, with a hand to ease his aching back. time for bed. our bed is a rolling ocean that i tread alone just a head bobbing above the ash-colored waves while the moon waits for me and everything to drown, to know again the peace the moon knows, the silence interrupted by astronauts, little green men, the spectacle a mother can’t help but make of  herself. god comes to bed and i clutch a spar, a barrel, an oar, and ride out the night with it. when he fucks me still he doesn’t speak, for speech is creation but i rock with him, i roll inside what cannot be comprehended, in force. i forget that i’m a man, i forget the wild sea, i let slip my grasp and the colors i have that cover me. once i dreamed of the morning: we left the house together in identical sober suits, we stood in the street and beheld the sad little town, wreathed in black crepe for its children. as though the morning could show me his face. he coughed. and when i awoke in our ordinary bed, streaked by sun through leaded windows, i held my baby to my breast and watched the roof  beam and whispered to her,it’s all right, we are safe only and always from our dreams.

 we who must act as handmaidens to our own goddess, turn too fast, trip on our hems, to glimpse the muse gliding below her lake or sea, are left, long-staring after her, narcissists by necessity;  or water-carriers of our young till waters burst, and white streams flow artesian, from the lifted breast: cupbearers then, to tiny gods, imperious table-pounders, who are final arbiters of thirst.  fasten the blouse, and mount the steps from kitchen taps to royal barge, assume the trident, don the crown, command the water music now that men bestow on virgin queens; or goddessing above the waist,  appear as swan on thames or charles where iridescent foam conceals the paddle-stroke beneath the glide: immortal feathers preened in poems! not our true, intimate nature, stained by labor, and the casual tide.  masters of civilization, you who moved to riverbank from cave, putting up tents, and deities, though every rivulet wander through the final, unpolluted glades to cinder-bank and culvert-lip,  and all the pretty chatterers still round the pebbles as they pass lightly over their watercourse, and even the calm rivers flow, we have, while springs and skies renew, dry wells, dead seas, and lingering drouth.  water itself is not enough. harness her turbulence to work for man: fill his reflecting pools. drained for his cofferdams, or stored in reservoirs for his personal use: turn switches! let the fountains play!  and yet these buccaneers still kneel trembling at the water's verge: “cool river-goddess, sweet ravine, spirit of pool and shade, inspire!” so he needs poultice for his flesh. so he needs water for his fire.  we rose in mists and died in clouds or sank below the trammeled soil to silent conduits underground, joining the blindfish, and the mole. a gleam of silver in the shale: lost murmur! subterranean moan!  so flows in dark caves, dries away, what would have brimmed from bank to bank, kissing the fields you turned to stone, under the boughs your axes broke. and you blame streams for thinning out, plundered by man’s insatiate want?  rejoice when a faint music rises out of a brackish clump of weeds, out of the marsh at ocean-side, out of the oil-stained river’s gleam, by the long causeways and gray piers your civilizing lusts have made.  discover the deserted beach where ghosts of curlews safely wade: here the warm shallows lave your feet like tawny hair of magdalens. here, if you care, and lie full-length, is water deep enough to drown.  
NEW POEM
 everything about the young foreign taxidermist was overdone. did he absolutely have to wear the apron with the tiny red castles in the shop? or weave, at night, in and out of the trees? i don’t think so. i would bring him buckets of ice water day after day hoping he would just cool off a bit. fact is, he never did. but to be fair, he really was practicing what the papers called, “heroic medicine.” it was love. i admit it. it was fancy love. i was the envy of the world, being hitched up with such a genius, and that felt good. of course, these days, i can’t touch rope or a small child without thinking of him. without expecting his large hands to come out of nowhere. we were, as mother said, both “slowly losing our minds.” he’d talk for hours about hygiene, the water cure for example, and wrote an award-winning essay on the electric bath as a way to treat hysteria in the female fox. “too many foxes,” he would say, shaking his fist, “too many foxes running around like chickens with their heads cut off.” in the winter months we would ride our bicycles down to the scrap-metal yard where he would make love to me in devout silence. the delight in his eyes when he found that small cage! he was both tender and rough, and i had never, and will never again, be as touched by another man. i didn’t notice the black mustache growing slowly but unmercifully on his left shoulder until two or three years into the affair. at first it seemed harmless. a small patch of dead grass. but eventually i couldn’t help but only see the large dark field. its silent twitching. by then it was already early fall, and the fact is, it tore us apart.  
NEW POEM
 poor devil, dog six years on a tether clipped to a cubby box. the sun dropped into a slot on one side &amp; after a dark spell popped up on the other. birds of a weather chattered along wires overhead &amp; the yards around shrilled emergencies.  who knew? once upon afternoon a dust demon spins itself up in the master’s tumbleweed to his match scratch: puff: mega blaze &amp; four hours’ ruckus until doused out. i’ll bask  three days in wonders. i’ll slobber &amp; yawn. i’ll gnaw &amp; grunt in my groin to my heart’s content.  they say death changes a body’s mind about things. master shuts up &amp; just rots.  
NEW POEM
 it was bruise marks of hands that alluded to tracks of murder. her neck was twisted too many times in short rope, and the tree too high for a small woman.  “he was here.” he says, “he came to her new man, too, and said that he was coming for him next.”  the nightmare is black tongue. no footprints. the form in the room laughs, “ha ha, goody!” he sees that it is vapor.  later, when he cuts her down, he knows that she came to him, to him, she laughed. the night will not make her unhappy.  he had no time to hunt, since he had to bury three more brothers the next day. car wreck on ice.  the insidious soul danced across the river to entice other women to death.  if he is man, he is subject to will. if one prefers archangels, he can be cast into oblivion.  that does not comfort the people and we must battle with bell and prayer, for the brother. this will take up the nights and the rest of our thoughts. the brother has seen the foreshadowing of events. he will bring the damned down in his fisherman’s grip into the mad boil of the river’s strength.  
NEW POEM
 my darling turns to poetry at night. what began as flirtation, an aside between abstract expression and first light  now finds form as a silent, startled flight of commas on her face — a breath, a word ... my darling turns to poetry at night.  when rain inspires the night birds to create rhyme and formal verse, stanzas can be made between abstract expression and first light.  her heartbeat is a metaphor, a late bloom of red flowers that refuse to fade. my darling turns to poetry at night.  i watch her turn. i do not sleep. i wait for symbols, for a sign that fear has died between abstract expression and first light.  her dreams have night vision, and in her sight our bodies leave ghostprints on the bed. my darling turns to poetry at night between abstract expression and first light.  
NEW POEM
 he says he doesn’t feel like working today. it’s just as well. here in the shade behind the house, protected from street noises, one can go over all kinds of old feeling, throw some away, keep others. the wordplay between us gets very intense when there are fewer feelings around to confuse things. another go-round? no, but the last things you always find to say are charming, and rescue me before the night does. we are afloat on our dreams as on a barge made of ice, shot through with questions and fissures of starlight that keep us awake, thinking about the dreams as they are happening. some occurrence. you said it.  i said it but i can hide it. but i choose not to. thank you. you are a very pleasant person. thank you. you are too.  
NEW POEM
 the last train pulses across the pane and fireflies spark beside the tracks. acne’s red wing flames my face: i can’t take back  this skin. in the other room, a drugstore timex synchronizes with the faucet’s drip. if i squint, the fireflies align their lives  to map the summer’s migraine of flowers that were weeds. you say,but i think they’re just trying to survive —  
NEW POEM
 my house is the red earth; it could be the center of the world. i’ve heard new york, paris, or tokyo called the center of the world, but i say it is magnificently humble. you could drive by and miss it. radio waves can obscure it. words cannot construct it, for there are some sounds left to sacred wordless form. for instance, that fool crow, picking through trash near the corral, understands the center of the world as greasy strips of fat. just ask him. he doesn’t have to say that the earth has turned scarlet through fierce belief, after centuries of heartbreak and laughter—he perches on the blue bowl of the sky, and laughs.  
NEW POEM
 my lute awake! perform the last labour that thou and i shall waste, and end that i have now begun; for when this song is sung and past, my lute be still, for i have done.  as to be heard where ear is none, as lead to grave in marble stone, my song may pierce her heart as soon; should we then sigh or sing or moan? no, no, my lute, for i have done.  the rocks do not so cruelly repulse the waves continually, as she my suit and affection; so that i am past remedy, whereby my lute and i have done.  proud of the spoil that thou hast got of simple hearts thorough love's shot, by whom, unkind, thou hast them won, think not he hath his bow forgot, although my lute and i have done.  vengeance shall fall on thy disdain that makest but game on earnest pain. think not alone under the sun unquit to cause thy lovers plain, although my lute and i have done.  perchance thee lie wethered and old the winter nights that are so cold, plaining in vain unto the moon; thy wishes then dare not be told; care then who list, for i have done.  and then may chance thee to repent the time that thou hast lost and spent to cause thy lovers sigh and swoon; then shalt thou know beauty but lent, and wish and want as i have done.  now cease, my lute; this is the last labour that thou and i shall waste, and ended is that we begun. now is this song both sung and past: my lute be still, for i have done.  
NEW POEM
 —faulkner my mother is a fish and the sky is low and orange, and the long grass rises in the still air. the mud is black and worms turn their cold segments at my feet.  i used to walk with an old lady. it seemed far from water and the ground sank. weeds were higher than my head. slugs slept in the mud.  my mother is a fish and the sky swallows my head. a fine rain comes and softens the ferns.  in march before the crocus and the lily, eggs bunch in the shoal of green jelly. crabs glide through them. a kingfisher is dead on a rock.  my mother is an eel winding a light around the rock. even without a moon the black glows.   *  the sun grows like an egg over the bridge, the first birds are silver and swoop down for my mother.  when the lady came we jumped— she took us to find worms we could squeeze in our hands.  i went with my father to the dark water. i went with a bucket of mud. when we doubled the worm on the hook and it coiled, i could hear how a bass could thud.  i grabbed it with a wet hand, and watched its eye go black as i dropped it in a metal bucket.  hack it along the gill and throw the head to the gulls.  
NEW POEM
 i had a fascination with your dresses — the greens, brocades, the belted shapes which spoke of you more poignantly than the photos in their careful frames.  your shoes were their own country, the heels, satins, the inexplicable mud — i scraped them with small fingernails, marveling at the gorgeous debris, wishing i had a microscope.  i searched your handbags, examined them for signs, evidence — where you were going, where you had been: tickets, lipstick, inked hieroglyphics, a broken comb.  i even smelled your stockings, sniffing at the crotches like a dog, frantic for any trace of you, my eyes raking their length, wondering at ladders, searching for clues.  my father came upon me once, cross-legged on the floor, his sad smile telling me more than any detection — he took my hand, and closed the door.

 my name came from my great-great-great-grandfather. he was an indian from the choctaw tribe. his name was dark ant. when he went to get a job out in a city he changed it to emmett. and his whole name was emmett perez tenorio. and my name means:  ant; strong; carry twice its size.

 a basket of apples brown in our kitchen, their warm scent is the scent of ripening,  and my sister, entering the room quietly, takes a seat at the table, takes up the task  of peeling slowly away the blemished skins, even half-rotten ones are salvaged carefully.  she makes sure to carve out the mealy flesh. for this, i am grateful. i explain,this elegy  would love to save everything. she smiles at me, and before long, the empty bowl she uses fills,  domed with thin slices she brushes into the mouth of a steaming pot on the stove.  what can i do? i ask finally.nothing, she says,let me finish this one thing alone.  
NEW POEM
 the autumn-time has come; on woods that dream of bloom, and over purpling vines, the low sun fainter shines.  the aster-flower is failing, the hazel’s gold is paling; yet overhead more near the eternal stars appear!  and present gratitude insures the future’s good, and for the things i see i trust the things to be;  that in the paths untrod, and the long days of god, my feet shall still be led, my heart be comforted.  o living friends who love me! o dear ones gone above me! careless of other fame, i leave to you my name.  hide it from idle praises, save it from evil phrases: why, when dear lips that spake it are dumb, should strangers wake it?  let the thick curtain fall; i better know than all how little i have gained, how vast the unattained.  not by the page word-painted let life be banned or sainted: deeper than written scroll the colors of the soul.  sweeter than any sung my songs that found no tongue; nobler than any fact my wish that failed of act.  others shall sing the song, others shall right the wrong,— finish what i begin, and all i fail of win.  what matter, i or they? mine or another’s day, so the right word be said and life the sweeter made?  hail to the coming singers! hail to the brave light-bringers! forward i reach and share all that they sing and dare.  the airs of heaven blow o’er me; a glory shines before me of what mankind shall be,— pure, generous, brave, and free.  a dream of man and woman diviner but still human, solving the riddle old, shaping the age of gold!  the love of god and neighbor; an equal-handed labor; the richer life, where beauty walks hand in hand with duty.  ring, bells in unreared steeples, the joy of unborn peoples! sound, trumpets far off blown, your triumph is my own!  parcel and part of all, i keep the festival, fore-reach the good to be, and share the victory.  i feel the earth move sunward, i join the great march onward, and take, by faith, while living, my freehold of thanksgiving.

 when my hole-punch drizzles tiny paper circles onto the carpet, my wolf sister moans and bites it, covering her ears with her paws. i think she’s tired of the moon. she takes a stack of dinner plates from my cupboard and slinks off to the park to break them. our brother shows up a week later, collapses on the sofa like a fur throw. why have they come here when everything i do is wrong? they howl in the shower together but the water doesn’t mask the sound. i go in afterwards with paper towels to mop the droplets–i know there’ll be water all over–but the room is bone dry. maybe this time things will be different. i hide the home movies in case they ask for them. in the one i always watch, there’s some wobbly footage of the sky, then my father lowers the camera’s eye to mother teaching my sister and brother to “tell time.” they’re following a mother hare on her sunset rounds–one leveret mouthful at 12 o’clock, another at 3, 6, 9. then the camera zooms in on me–i’ve spat out my pacifier made of fur and i’m on the porch surrounded by bonsai trees, killing or saving barbie.  
NEW POEM
 i should be happy with my lot: a wife and mother – is it not enough for me to be content? what other blessing could be sent?  a quiet house, and homely ways, that make each day like other days; i only see time’s shadow now darken the hair on baby’s brow!  no world’s work ever comes to me, no beggar brings his misery; i have no power, no healing art with bruised soul or broken heart.  i read the poets of the age, ’tis lotus-eating in a cage; i study art, but art is dead to one who clamors to be fed  with milk from nature’s rugged breast, who longs for labor’s lusty rest. o foolish wish! i still should pine if any other lot were mine.  
NEW POEM
 like fishermen at dusk, the soldiers returned from war with stories slumped over their shoulders; their fingers firm at the knot, the netting, thick and tangled with the names of the dead.  none could explain how the flood of life all around them escaped like water from between cupped hands, how the bodies of men they loved began to crust the earth like salt, how destruction danced slapdash and unashamed everywhere, and still they survived.  when i came home from college proud, my educated mouth agape, a tackle box of words, slick and glossy and i saw the names of my friends, the young men i fought with, learned to drink with, and left behind  lil’rocc, pumpkin, ulysses, junebug, aghoster names spray-painted throughout our neighborhood in memoriam, i couldn’t understand how a god could make one life possible and strip the world clean of so many, or how, like high-watermarks the dead remind the living of the coming of storms.  
NEW POEM
 back in those days, when he told me about his adventures in sex clubs it wasn't the whys and wherefores  but technical details, like going rafting down the colorado river; and when he wrote  about a gay male friend whose first sexual experience was with his stepfather, the friend told him  it wasn't weird, but the best possible thing that could have happened . . . i saw then that god,  who i never believed in, was dwelling in my heart as a negative: that the negative had been developed  into a picture of a man who stares up at the sky on a day so clear he sees through the mountain's shadows  to the divinely human-seeming form that climbs it— a neighbor in running shoes and sunglasses  jogging up the slope with his dog, tongue panting and slavering, an acute look of happiness in its eyes  that could turn at any moment into exhaustion or pain as in a maze of cubicles called asshole alley, little pyramids  of canvas called lust of the pharaohs, different pricing for what you want, depending on the equipment,  the air thick with a sour, acidic, head-fogging reek of come. . . . and my pal the poet, who believed  in infernal chemistry, in the spirit as a kind of "spooky action at a distance," he communed  with this god, this eternally dying father of all matter who made out of our bodies his own maze of cubicles  where he hides himself away—his sanctuary asshole alley where god's own unholy loves  bubble all around him like a cauldron in his ears— and my poet pal heard the bubbling, he stirred  the pot, he showed me the holy city, the sexual new jerusalem that came prepared as a bride adorned for her husband . . .  —that was how it was in those days, back when my friend hadn't yet met the coroner who wrote down  his cause of death as "polysubstance abuse" that brought on his heart attack while fucking . . .  and regardless if i believed, whenever we were together god shone clearer—  those were the days when every morning god woke up in a blur of ecstasy and went to bed every night  in divine rage. whoever loved him, he loved. whoever hated him,  he hated back: for who can doubt the vitality of hate or the volatility of love.

 her eyes the glow-worm lend thee, the shooting stars attend thee; and the elves also, whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire, befriend thee.  no will-o'-th'-wisp mis-light thee, nor snake or slow-worm bite thee; but on, on thy way, not making a stay, since ghost there's none to affright thee.  let not the dark thee cumber; what though the moon does slumber? the stars of the night will lend thee their light, like tapers clear without number.  then julia let me woo thee, thus, thus to come unto me; and when i shall meet thy silv'ry feet, my soul i'll pour into thee.  
NEW POEM
 people would come to my great-grandmother’s house. she was in a room. they would stay in the kitchen. the words their words rolled like cars by on a train here from somewhere else and going somewhere else moving on faster almost than we could read them, sound them out my brother and me with our small mouths, chessie, a cat, see? the erie, santa fe, ferrocarril, ore cars from the southern pacific, brown and all the numbers of all the engines. the words they rolled easier, fat and longer with each beer held in a fist and hit against brown lips and thin tongues, and things slid out of those mouths then with the drinking, took shape in sounds larger than we were, those uncles’ laughs, loud things which could be called back no longer. the words they rolled into plates of food up with the smoke curling, there around the elbows, the words and the smoke, a tablecloth, a rope wound like a hypnotist’s wheel) all of it catching the heads of our mother in weak headlocks that fooled us—we had thought we were stronger with our thousand gatling short words, half tears, half whispered. we were not. the words they rolled their wheels they rolled until the mayonnaise turned light and then dark brown until we slept in the corners, my brother and my cousins, me with midnight and puerquito, our own hands held around ourselves, our voices intimate only with the animals, who understood something of us, who let us hold their heads to our chests, who looked at the things we whispered. the words, they rolled, they, they would not stop. i closed my eyes then, and their phrases became birds, long birds, fat, snake birds that would not fly. a single laugh, some thin tongue pulled to its shrill kicking roots, this one laugh, an uncle’s, it was the thinnest and strongest string pulling their faces up together like puppets and they hit each other, those wooden heads laughing, hit each other rolling, blunt-edged side hitting sides like rocks and pieces of hill heading along toward some bottom, heading somewhere, the place of the broken parts. nothing would take me by the hand, only the handle on the drawer in the corner, my hand holding it, my eyes seeing how it became a licorice stick, then thousands of them holding me, by the eyes, so i could see nothing, hear only the sounds of a second world in league with the thunder and this night of summer. the words, they rolled, they would not stop, they would not take me home.

 i am a woman. no more and no less i live my life as it is thread by thread and i spin my wool to wear, not to complete homer’s story, or his sun. and i see what i see as it is, in its shape, though i stare every once in a while in its shade to sense the pulse of defeat, and i write tomorrow on yesterday’s sheets: there’s no sound other than echo. i love the necessary vagueness in what a night traveler says to the absence of birds over the slopes of speech and above the roofs of villages i am a woman, no more and no less  the almond blossom sends me flying in march, from my balcony, in longing for what the faraway says: “touch me and i’ll bring my horses to the water springs.” i cry for no clear reason, and i love you as you are, not as a strut nor in vain and from my shoulders a morning rises onto you and falls into you, when i embrace you, a night. but i am neither one nor the other no, i am not a sun or a moon i am a woman, no more and no less  so be the qyss of longing, if you wish. as for me i like to be loved as i am not as a color photo in the paper, or as an idea composed in a poem amid the stags … i hear laila’s faraway scream from the bedroom: do not leave me a prisoner of rhyme in the tribal nights do not leave me to them as news … i am a woman, no more and no less  i am who i am, as you are who you are: you live in me and i live in you, to and for you i love the necessary clarity of our mutual puzzle i am yours when i overflow the night but i am not a land or a journey i am a woman, no more and no less  and i tire from the moon’s feminine cycle and my guitar falls ill string by string i am a woman, no more and no less!

 when my brother died i worried there wasn’t enough time to deliver the one hundred invitations i’d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary: because of the short notice no need to rsvp.  unfortunately the firemen couldn’t come. (i had hoped they’d give free rides on the truck.) they did agree to drive by the house once with the lights on— it was a party after all.  i put mom and dad in charge of balloons, let them blow as many years of my brother’s name, jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls, fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of. the scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling like they’d been filled with helium. mom blew up so many that she fell asleep. she slept for ten years— she missed the whole party.  my brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding his stained t-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up into the air like confetti.  when the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out the front door. they seemed to know where they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins at the end of our cul-de-sac. the clowns played toy bugles until the air was scented with rotten raspberries. they pulled scarves from mom’s ear—she slept through it. i baked my brother’s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting). when i counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen. we all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.  a few stray dogs came to the window. i heard their stomachs and mouths growling over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom. (there was no room in the hallway because of the magician.) the mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics. i told the dogs,no more cake here, and shut the window. the fire truck came by with the sirens on. the dogs ran away. i sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.  i wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house, taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them— remote controls, the polaroid, stereo, shop-vac, even the motor to dad’s work truck—everything my brother had taken apart and put back together doing his crystal meth tricks—he’d always been a magician of sorts.  two mutants came to the door. one looked almost human. they wanted to know if my brother had willed them the pots and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom. they said they missed my brother’s cooking and did we have any cake.no more cake here, i told them. well, what’s in the piñata? they asked. i told them god was and they ran into the desert, barefoot. i gave dad his slice and put mom’s in the freezer. i brought up the pots and pans and spoons (really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them together like a new year’s day celebration.  my brother finally showed up asking why he hadn’t been invited and who baked the cake. he told me i shouldn’t smile, that this whole party was shit because i’d imagined it all. the worst part he said was he was still alive. the worst part he said was he wasn’t even dead. i think he’s right, but maybe the worst part is that i’m still imagining the party, maybe the worst part is that i can still taste the cake.

 i went to my mother’s room at 13 past midnight, and told her i was dying. i’d wet the bed, i’d had this crazy dream, about a sexy neighbor i’d been spying on. well, i didn’t tell her that. i mean, the day before she asked who i was eyeing when i didn’t want to go outside for ice cream. the truck was parked out front, and she was buying, but i couldn’t join the other screaming kids — not with lance applying suntan lotion to his muscled teenage skin. stretched out on a beach towel in his front yard, his body mystified me, while mine seemed happy to defy me. my dick would tent my cut-offs at the sight of him. i wore two pair of underwear, but even then i thought i’d burst right through the seams. so i didn’t dare tell mother what i’d dreamed, though she did think to ask me. i’d have been a fool to tell her that. she thought my blush was any boy’s, puzzling out his sexuality, but i swear it was as much because the fantasies were always other boys. some from my baseball team, some the roughnecks at school, but usually lance. he was flying naked in the dream i had that night, the one that made me think that god was mad and killing me. i was lying (also naked — and hard as cinder block) on the beach towel i’d seen him lay across the grass the day before. i tried to understand the signs implying i might turn into some kind of freaky thing. but it would have been cruel to tell my mother that, especially when she was already crying, and trying not to laugh at the same time, when i showed her what came out of me. she apologized for throwing such a scene, said i was growing up to be a man, that’s all it meant, said it was normal for a boy my age’s thing to start uprising like a metal beam. she apologized again that i didn’t have my dad around to train an 11-year old boy in the ways of puberty. i was as stupefied as i’ve ever been. she never mentioned him. and i have never turned a deeper red than i did then, at 26 past midnight, when my mother helped me change my sheets, and said the next day she’d teach me to wash them. and then she said she’d ask the man across the street to talk to me. would that be okay? or would i feel more comfortable with someone younger, like his son?

 this happened long ago, before the onset of universal genetic correctness.  boys and girls would stand naked before mirrors studying the defects of their structure.  nose too long, ears like burdocks, sunken chin just like a mongoloid.  breasts too small, too large, lopsided shoulders, penis too short, hips too broad or else too narrow.  and just an inch or two taller!  such was the house they inhabited for life.  hiding, feigning, concealing defects.  but somehow they still had to find a partner.  following incomprehensible tastes—airy creatures paired with potbellies, skin and bones enamored of salt pork.  they had a saying then: “even monsters have their mates.” so perhaps they learned to tolerate their partners’ flaws, trusting that theirs would be forgiven in turn.  now every genetic error meets with such disgust that crowds might spit on them and stone them.  as happened in the city of k., where the town council voted to exile a girl  so thickset and squat that no stylish dress could ever suit her,  but let’s not yearn for the days of prenormalization. just think of the torments, the anxieties, the sweat, the wiles needed to entice, in spite of all.   translated by clare cavanagh

 i was always a thoughtful youngster, said the lady on the omnibus, i remember father used to say, you are more thoughtful than us.  i was sensitive too, the least thing upset me so much, i used to cry if a fly stuck in the hatch.  mother always said, elsie is too good, there’ll never be another like elsie, touch wood.  i liked to be alone, sitting on the garden path, my brother said he’d never seen a picture more like faith in the arena.  they were kindly people, my people, i could not help being different, and i think it was good for me mixing in a different element.  the poor lady now burst out crying and i saw her friend was not a friend but a nurse for she said, cheer up duckie the next stop is ours, they got off at northumberland house.  this great house of the percies is now a lunatic asylum, but over the gate there still stands the great northumberland lion.  this family animal’s tail is peculiar in that it is absolutely straight, and straight as a bar it stood out to drop after them as they went through the gate.   november 1964

 the black water.  lights dotting the entire perimeter.  their shaky reflections.  the dark tree line.  the plap-plapping of water around the pier.  creaking boats.  the creaking pier.  voices in conversation, in discussion—two men, adults—serious inflections (the words themselves just out of reach).  a rusty screen-door spring, then the door swinging shut.  footsteps on a porch, the scrape of a wooden chair.  footsteps shuffling through sand, animated youthful voices (how many?)— distinct, disappearing.  a sudden guffaw; some giggles; a woman’s—no, a young girl’s—sarcastic reply; someone’s assertion; a high-pitched male cackle.  somewhere else a child laughing.  bug-zappers.  tires whirring along a pavement... not stopping ... receding.  shadows from passing headlights.  a cat’s eyes caught in a headlight.  no moon.  connect-the-dot constellations filling the black sky—the ladle of the big dipper not quite directly overhead.  the radio tower across the lake, signaling.  muffled quacking near the shore; a frog belching; crickets, cicadas, katydids, etc.—their relentless sexual messages.  a sudden gust of wind.  branches brushing against each other—pine, beech.  a fiberglass hull tapping against the dock.  a sudden chill.  the smell of smoke, woodstove fires.  a light going out.  a dog barking; then more barking from another part of the lake.  a burst of quiet laughter.  someone in the distance calling someone too loud.  steps on a creaking porch.  a screen-door spring, the door banging shut.  another light going out (you must have just undressed for bed).  my bare feet on the splintery pier turning away from the water.

 what i adore is not horses, with their modern domestic life span of 25 years. what i adore is a bug that lives only one day, especially if it’s a terrible day, a day of train derailment or chemical lake or cop admits to cover-up, a day when no one thinks of anything else, least of all that bug. i know how it feels, born as i’ve been into these rotting times, as into sin. everybody’s busy, so distraught they forget to kill me, and even that won’t keep me alive. i share my home not with horses, but with a little dog who sees poorly at dusk and menaces stumps, makes her muscle known to every statue. i wish she could have a single day of   language, so that i might reassure her don’t be afraid— our whole world is dead and so can do you no harm.

 the blood-smear across the knuckles: painless, inexplicable. once you discover it pain will begin, in miniature. never will you learn what caused it. you forget it.  the telephone answered on the twelfth ring: silence without breath, cunning, stark. and then he hangs up. and you stand there, alone. then you forget.  and your father's inexplicable visit: two days' notice, a ten-hour reckless drive. rains, 80 mph winds, bad luck all the way, traffic backed up, a broken windshield wiper, and no stopping him.  clumsy handshakes. how are—? you seem—! how good to —! how long will—? he must leave in the morning, must get back. a gas station two blocks away repairs the wiper.  did he sense death, and so he raced to us? did he already guess at his death behind those nervous fond smiles, the tumult of memories he had to bear?  nothing we know can explain his visit, or the new, strange way he moved among us— touching us, squeezing our arms, smiling. the visit was an excuse. the words that surrounded our touching were an excuse. inexplicable, that the language we invent may be a means to get us closer, to allow us to touch one another, and then to back away.

 no, no, go not to lethe, neither twist wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine; nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd by nightshade, ruby grape of proserpine; make not your rosary of yew-berries, nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be your mournful psyche, nor the downy owl a partner in your sorrow's mysteries; for shade to shade will come too drowsily, and drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.  but when the melancholy fit shall fall sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud, that fosters the droop-headed flowers all, and hides the green hill in an april shroud; then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose, or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, or on the wealth of globed peonies; or if thy mistress some rich anger shows, emprison her soft hand, and let her rave, and feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.  she dwells with beauty—beauty that must die; and joy, whose hand is ever at his lips bidding adieu; and aching pleasure nigh, turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips: ay, in the very temple of delight veil'd melancholy has her sovran shrine, though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue can burst joy's grape against his palate fine; his soul shalt taste the sadness of her might, and be among her cloudy trophies hung.

 and now, my marian, from its shackles free, my wearied fancy turns for ease to thee; to thee, my compass through life’s varied stream, my constant object, and unfailing theme. torn from the bosom of my soul’s repose, and self-devoted to surrounding woes, oft o’er my solitary thoughts i brood— (for passing crowds to me are solitude)— catch thy loved image, on thy beauties dwell, improved by graces which no tongue can tell, the look which i have seen, by love endeared, the voice to love attuned, which i have heard. or rapt in thoughts of higher worth, adore thy virtues, drawn by mem’ry’s faithful store; or court, as now obsequious at her shrine, the muse, unkind on ev’ry theme but thine. nor foreign deem from such a frame of mind this tale, to meet thy gracious ear designed, to me, and to my state, alike belong the subject, and the moral, of my song,  ’tis true, no serpent of envenomed breath hath stung my love, ere yet a bride, to death; and, o! may heav’n for many years to come, preserve her life from nature’s final doom! yet is she lost to me, in substance dead, with half the traversed globe between us spread; dreadful transition! in one moment’s cost my soul’s whole wealth i saw, and held, and lost. the fate and silence closed life’s blissful scene, its being past, as it had never been. the sad rememberance only now remains, and by contrasting aggravates my pains. hope still attendant and delusive stands, and points, but coldly points, to distant lands; gilds their faint summits with her flatt’ring ray; but deserts, rocks, and seas obstruct the way; and age, and sickness, and the clouds that teem with unknown thunders, through the prospect gleam.  ah me! no gods, nor angels now descend, the sons of men in pity to befriend! my sufferings else might some kind spirit move to give me back on terms the wife i love: and more than half my life would i resign, for health, her purchase, and herself, for mine, borne by the pow’rs of air, or she should rise, or i rejoin her through the distant skies. no more my thoughts in solitude should mourn my sweet companion from my presence torn; nor rigid duty force me to remain, and see her sails diminish on the main. to her my destined hours, though few, i’d give, and while i lived, a life of bliss i’d live.

 six o'clock: the kitchen bulbs which blister your dark, your housewives starting to nose out each other's day, the claustrophobia of your back gardens varicose with shrubs, make an ugly sister of you suburbia.  how long ago did the glass in your windows subtly silver into mirrors which again and again show the same woman shriek at a child? which multiply a dish, a brush, ash, the gape of a fish.  in the kitchen, the gape of a child in the cot? you swelled so that when you tried the silver slipper on your foot it pinched your instep and the common hurt which touched you made you human.  no creature of the streets will feel the touch of a wand turning the wet sinews of fruit suddenly to a coach, while this rat without leather reins or a whip or britches continues sliming your drains.  no magic here. yet you encroach until the shy countryside, fooled by your plainness falls, then rises from your bed changed, schooled forever by your skill, your compromises.  midnight and your metamorphosis is now complete, although the mind which spinstered you might still miss your mystery now, might still fail to see your power defined by this detail.  by this creature drowsing now in every house— the same lion who tore stripes once off zebras. who now sleeps, small beside the coals. and may, on a red letter day, catch a mouse.

 when a creature dies ... the flesh and soft parts of the body rot quickly. all that is left are the bones and teeth. (textbook entry on ‘fossils’)  sometimes. you, mother, dying, left what was hard first: bones weeping into  your veins like flutes, teeth vanished on some hospital lunch tray. in your last  mute days you parted with one more hard thing: the gold ring i was to save  for my child. as your hand offered that bright circle (only seen as a  whole now, when empty) did your thoughts reach, like mine, for your first wedding ring?  you took that one off when i was seven or eight and sent it spinning  from a car window. i can still feel the wet blades of grass slipping through  my fingers, night dew coming on, you and father loud in the parked car.  i searched there as if life spilled from a ring that lay somewhere out of sight  but within reach, hid where only the crickets knew. i took the scraping  of their mating calls for crying, as if they shared loss—my childish heart  consoled by a soft ‘as if.’ the consolation carries on: their song  (light as air, softer than voices) plays through my thoughts about that evening  and fills the lost ring’s hollow with life’s most lasting part, cries for new love.

 radiant child of leto, farworking lord apollo, with lyre in hand and golden plectrum, you sang to the gods on mount olympus almost as soon as you were born.  you sang, and the muses sang in answer, and together your voices so delighted all your deathless elders that their perfect happiness was made more perfect still.  what was it, though, that overwhelmed them, that suffused, astonished, even the endless ether? was it the freshest, most wonderful stops of breath, the flawless intervals  and scales whose harmonies were mimicking in sound the beauty of the gods themselves, or what you joined to that, what you were singing of, our balked desires,  the miseries we suffer at your indifferent hands, devastation and bereavement, old age and death? farworking, radiant child, what do you know about us?  here is my father, half blind, and palsied, at the toilet, he’s shouting at his penis, piss, you! piss! piss! but the penis (like the heavenly host to mortal prayers)  is deaf and dumb; here, too, my mother with her bad knee, on the eve of surgery, hobbling by the bathroom, pausing, saying, who are you talking to in there?  and he replies, no one you would know, sweetheart. supernal one, in your untested mastery, your easy excellence, with nothing to overcome,  and needing nothing but the most calamitous and abject stories to prove how powerful you are, how truly free, watch them as they laugh so briefly,  godlike, better than gods, if only for a moment in which what goes wrong is converted to a rightness, if only because now she’s hobbling back to bed  where she won’t sleep, if only because he pees at last, missing the bowl, and has to get down on his knees to wipe it up. you don’t know anything about us.

 a few days after my mother died the furnace went out, and my father, who had been sitting in his chair across from hers since the funeral,  his unshaven chin on his chest, heaved himself up and went down the cold gray cellar stairs to see if he could relight the pilot himself  or would have to call for help. i know what it must have been like because i remember him other times on his back down there, cursing  match after match, god damning each for burning his fingers, as he reached through the tiny metal door as many times as it took. this time  it lit, caught, and roared back to life. when my father sat up he faced the washer, the dryer, the empty laundry basket, the ironing board,  and my mother’s radio above the sink, her absence so vivid that climbing the stairs he thought he heard her behind him, and he turned around.

 book six    chapter xliv  i   in hill-towns, from san fernando to mayagüez, the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane down the archipelago’s highways. the first breeze  rattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain marching down from the hills, like a shell at your ears. in the cool asphalt sundays of the antilles  the light brought the bitter history of sugar across the squared fields, heightening towards harvest, to the bleached flags of the indian diaspora.  the drizzling light blew across the savannah darkening the racehorses’ hides; mist slowly erased the royal palms on the crests of the hills and the  hills themselves. the brown patches the horses had grazed shone as wet as their hides. a skittish stallion jerked at his bridle, marble-eyed at the thunder  muffling the hills, but the groom was drawing him in like a fisherman, wrapping the slack line under one fist, then with the other tightening the rein  and narrowing the circle. the sky cracked asunder and a forked tree flashed, and suddenly that black rain which can lose an entire archipelago  in broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof, hammering the balcony. i closed the french window, and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hoof  tilted, watching the ropes of rain. i lay in bed with current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar of wind shaking the windows, and i remembered  achille on his own mattress and desperate hector trying to save his canoe, i thought of helen as my island lost in the haze, and i was sure  i’d never see her again. all of a sudden the rain stopped and i heard the sluicing of water down the guttering. i opened the window when  the sun came out. it replaced the tiny brooms of palms on the ridges. on the red galvanized roof of the paddock, the wet sparkled, then the grooms  led the horses over the new grass and exercised them again, and there was a different brightness in everything, in the leaves, in the horses’ eyes.   ii   i smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year in green january over the orange villas and military barracks where the plunketts were,  the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with christmas, edged with the arctic, that was christened vent noël; it stayed until march and, with luck, until easter.  it freshened the cedars, waxed the laurier-cannelle, and hid the african swift. i smelt the drizzle on the asphalt leaving the morne, it was the smell  of an iron on damp cloth; i heard the sizzle of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin; i smelt ham studded with cloves, the crusted accra,  the wax in the varnished parlour: come in. come in, the arm of the morris chair sticky with lacquer; i saw a sail going out and a sail coming in,  and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains like a petticoat, like a sail towards ithaca; i smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains.   iii   ah, twin-headed january, seeing either tense: a past, they assured us, born in degradation, and a present that lifted us up with the wind’s  noise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation that it contradicts what is past! the cannonballs of rotting breadfruit from the battle of the saints,  the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls of the redoubt. i lived there with every sense. i smelt with my eyes, i could see with my nostrils.    chapter xlv  i   one side of the coast plunges its precipices into the atlantic. turns require wide locks, since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just misses  a long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks between the trees. there is a wide view of dennery, with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose base  the african breakers end. across the flecked sea whose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace the next port is dakar. the uninterrupted wind  thuds under the wings of frigates, you see them bent from a force that has crossed the world, tilting to find purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current.  the breeze threshed the palms on the cool december road where the comet hurtled with empty leopard seats, so fast a man on a donkey trying to read  its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend  away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend, where hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet  and thought of plunkett’s warning as he heard it screel with the same sound that the tires of the comet made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel.  the rear wheels spin to a dead stop, like a helm. the piglet trots down the safer side of the road. lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame.  hector had both hands on the wheel. his head was bowed under the swaying statue of the madonna of the rocks, her smile swayed under the blue hood,  and when her fluted robe stilled, the smile stayed on her dimpled porcelain. she saw, in the bowed man, the calm common oval of prayer, the head’s usual angle  over the pew of the dashboard. her lifted palm, small as a doll’s from its cerulean mantle, indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace  of foam round the cliff’s altar, that now, if he wished, he could lift his head, but he stayed in the same place, the way a man will remain when mass is finished,  not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross forehead, heart, and shoulders swiftly and then kneel facing the altar. he bowed in endless remorse,  for her mercy at what he had done to achille, his brother. but his arc was over, for the course of every comet is such. the fated crescent  was printed on the road by the scorching tires. a salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped  the wheel. on the flecked sea, the uninterrupted wind herded the long african combers, and whipped the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.   ii   drivers leant over the rail. one seized my luggage off the porter’s cart. the rest burst into patois, with gestures of despair at the lost privilege  of driving me, then turned to other customers. in the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet with light that shot its lances over the combers.  i had the transport all to myself. “you all set? good. a good pal of mine died in that chariot of his called the comet.” he turned in the front seat,  spinning the air with his free hand. i sat, sprawled out in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet. “you never know when, eh? i was at the airport  that day. i see him take off like a rocket. i always said that thing have too much horsepower. and so said, so done. the same hotel, chief, correct?”  i saw the coastal villages receding as the highway’s tongue translated bush into forest, the wild savannah into moderate pastures,  that other life going in its “change for the best,” its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocks  of hotel development with the obsolete craft of the carpenter, as i sensed, in the neat marinas, the fisherman’s phantom. old oarlocks  and rusting fretsaw. my craft required the same crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame  or planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsolete and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete.  i watched the afternoon sea. didn’t i want the poor to stay in the same light so that i could transfix them in amber, the afterglow of an empire,  preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks to that blue bus-stop? didn’t i prefer a road from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax  of colonial travellers, the measured prose i read as a schoolboy? that cove, with its brown shallows there, praslin? that heron? had they waited for me  to develop my craft? why hallow that pretence of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fence  smothered in love-vines, scenes to which i was attached as blindly as plunkett with his remorseful research? art is history’s nostalgia, it prefers a thatched  roof to a concrete factory, and the huge church above a bleached village. the gap between the driver and me increased when he said: “the place changing, eh?”  where an old rumshop had gone, but not that river with its clogged shadows.that would make me a stranger. “all to the good,” he said. i said, “all to the good,”  then, “whoever they are,” to myself. i caught his eyes in the mirror. we were climbing out of micoud. hadn’t i made their poverty my paradise?  his back could have been hector’s, ferrying tourists in the other direction home, the leopard seat scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests.  he had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat, who longed for snow on the moon and didn’t have to face the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climate  as monotonous as this one could only produce from its unvarying vegetation flashes of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies  that shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes of fake african masks for a fake achilles rattled with the seeds that came from other men’s minds.  so let them think that. who needed art in this place where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines, and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such grace  these people had, but what they envied most in them was the calypso part, the caribbean lilt still in the shells of their ears, like the surf’s rhythm,  until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt like any eden, and they sighed at the sign: hewannorra (iounalao), the gold sea  flat as a credit-card, extending its line to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else, greece or hawaii. now the goddamn souvenir  felt absurd, excessive. the painted gourds, the shells. their own faces as brown as gourds. mine felt as strange as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.   iii   change lay in our silence. we had come to that bend where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw, shelve surely to foam. “is right here everything end,”  the driver said, and rammed open the transport door on his side, then mine. “anyway, chief, the view nice.” i joined him at the gusting edge. “his name was hector.”  the name was bent like the trees on the precipice to point inland. in its echo a man-o’-war screamed on the wind. the driver moved off for a piss,  then shouted over his shoulder: “a road-warrior. he would drive like a madman when the power took. he had a nice woman. maybe he died for her.”  for her and tourism, i thought. the driver shook himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch. “crazy, but a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain.”  cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain across serengeti. cut to the spraying fans drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild mane  scaring the scamander. cut to a woman’s hands clenched towards her mouth with no sound. cut to the wheel of a chariot’s spiked hubcap. cut to the face  of his muscling jaw, then flashback to achille hurling a red tin and a cutlass. next, a vase with a girl’s hoarse whisper echoing “omeros,”  as in a conch-shell. cut to a shield of silver rolling like a hubcap. rewind, in slow motion, myrmidons gathering by a village river  with lances for oars. cut to the surpliced ocean droning its missal. cut. a crane hoisting a wreck. a horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck.  he’d paid the penalty of giving up the sea as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed, for the taxi-business; he was making money,  but all of that money was making him ashamed of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf hustling passengers. he missed the uncertain sand  under his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave, and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand, and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans.  castries was corrupting him with its roaring life, its littered market, with too many transport vans competing. castries had been his common-law wife  who, like helen, he had longed for from a distance, and now he had both, but a frightening discontent hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a love  he could never lose made every gesture violent: ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. he drove as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent.  a man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother. mer was both mother and sea. in his lost canoe he had said his prayers. but now he was in another  kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new stereo, its endless garages, where he could not whip off his shirt, hearing the conch’s summoning note.    chapter xlvi  i   hector was buried near the sea he had loved once. not too far from the shallows where he fought achille for a tin and helen. he did not hear the sea-almond’s  moan over the bay when philoctete blew the shell, nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail rattling to rest as its day’s work was over,  and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale, then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar, the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough  when it was their turn to lie quiet as hector, lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth’s trough, to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weather  on the violet-wreathed mound. crouching for his friend to hear, achille whispered about their ancestral river, and those things he would recognize when he got there,  his true home, forever and ever and ever, forever,compère. then philoctete limped over and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder  to anchor his sorrow. seven seas and helen did not come nearer. achille had carried an oar to the church and propped it outside with the red tin.  now his voice strengthened. he said: “mate, this is your spear,” and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier  the day the african swift and its shadow raced. and this was the prayer that achille could not utter: “the spear that i give you, my friend, is only wood.  vexation is past. i know how well you treat her. you never know my admiration, when you stood crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe  with the plates of your chest like a shield; i would say any enemy so was a compliment. ’cause no african ever hurled his wide seine at the bay  by which he was born with such beauty. you hear me? men did not know you like me. all right. sleep good. good night.” achille moved philoctete’s hand, then he saw helen  standing alone and veiled in the widowing light. then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin to her. helen nodded. a wind blew out the sun.   ii   pride set in helen’s face after this, like a stone bracketed with hector’s name; her lips were incised by its dates in parenthesis. she seemed more stern,  more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed the hot street of the village like a distant sail on the horizon. grief heightened her. when she smiled  it was with such distance that it was hard to tell if she had heard your condolence. it was the child, ma kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.   iii   the rites of the island were simplified by its elements, which changed places. the grooved sea was achille’s garden, the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense  of the sea, and philoctete, on his height, often heard, in a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges, the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke,  and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work as philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset,  smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if from his enamel pot. the woodsmoke smelt of a regret that men cannot name. on the charred field, the massive  sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the great indigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves, igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egret  to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves, take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again.  at night, the island reversed its elements, the heron of a quarter-moon floated from hector’s grave, rain rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated iron  of the sea glittered with nailheads. ragged plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers over the furrows of philoctete’s garden, a chorus of aged  ancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house in the village with its back garden, with its rank midden of rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon’s cold basin.  they sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in silence at the shadows of their lamplit children.  at philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow vaseline, and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin.  at night, when yards are asleep, and the broken line of the surf hisses like philo,“bon dieu, aie, waie, my sin is this sore?” the old plantains suffer and shine.    chapter xlvii  i   islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. the citron sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half  dipped its divining rod. the white spray of the thorn, which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound  from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand. ma kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe, eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step  of the rumshop’s back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge tight. the bolt caught a finger and with that her instep arch twisted and she let out a soft catholic  curse, then crossed herself. she closed the gate. the asphalt sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick over the fence. her spectacles swam in their sweat.  she plucked an armpit. the damn wig was badly made. she was going to five o’clock mass, to la messe, and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed  until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness, the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze. in the church’s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes.  she rolled down the elastic bands below the knees of her swollen stockings. it was then that their vise round her calves reminded her of philoctete. then,  numbering her beads, she began her own litany of berries, hail mary marigolds that stiffen their aureoles in the heights, mild anemone  and clear watercress, the sacred heart of jesus pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood, called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures,  the hole in the daisy’s palm, with its drying blood that was the hole in the fisherman’s shin since he was pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisane  of her malarial childhood. there was this one for easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath, before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun  ripened like her nipples in girlhood. but what path led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl couldn’t remember. mimosa winced from her fingers,  shutting like jalousies at some passing evil when she reached for them. the smell of incense lingers in her clothes. inside, the candle-flames are erect  round the bier of the altar while she and her friends old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.   ii   the dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings  of perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms of a cedar held council. between its gnarled toes grew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flower  sprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power, rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the nose  as a spike does a circling bull. to approach it ma kilman lowered her head to one side and screened the stench with a cologned handkerchief. the mulch it  was rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened, of philoctete’s cut. in her black dress, her berried black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village,  past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried suffer the sun all day sunday, while goats forage the new wreaths. once more she pulled at the itch in her  armpits, nearly dropping her purse. then she climbed hard up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her like a wound, and rested. everything that echoed  repeated its outline: a goat’s doddering bleat, a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards, a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat.  ma kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back, passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the wood  appeared over her, thick green, the green almost black as her dress in its shade, its border of flowers flecking the pasture with spray. then she staggered back  from the line of ants at her feet. she saw the course they had kept behind her, following her from church, signalling a language she could not recognize.   iii   a swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach centuries ago from its antipodal shore, skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luck  held to its shadow. she aimed to carry the cure that precedes every wound; the reversible bight of benin was her bow, her target the ringed haze  of a circling horizon. the star-grains at night made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house for her weariness. sometimes she dozed in her flight  for a swift’s second, closing the seeds of her stare, then ruddering straight. the dry sea-flakes whitened her breast, her feathers thinned. then, one dawn the day-star  rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong east. she saw the horned island and uncurled her claws  with one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song, and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed in grass near the sand. she nestled in dry seaweed.  in a year she was bleached bone. all of that motion a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will, but the vine grew its own wings, out of the ocean  it climbed like the ants, the ancestors of achille, the women carrying coals after the dark door slid over the hold. as the weed grew in odour  so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar, where the flower was anchored at the mottled root as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot.

 o what a strange parcel of creatures are we, scarce ever to quarrel, or even agree; we all are alone, though at home altogether, except to the fire constrained by the weather; then one says, ‘’tis cold’, which we all of us know, and with unanimity answer, ‘’tis so’: with shrugs and with shivers all look at the fire, and shuffle ourselves and our chairs a bit nigher; then quickly, preceded by silence profound, a yawn epidemical catches around: like social companions we never fall out, nor ever care what one another’s about; to comfort each other is never our plan, for to please ourselves, truly, is more than we can.

 i have not disappeared. the boulevard is full of my steps. the sky is full of my thinking. an archbishop prays for my soul, even though we met only once, and even then, he was busy waving at a congregation. the ticking clocks in vermont sway  back and forth as though sweeping up my eyes and my tattoos and my metaphors, and what comes up are the great paragraphs of dust, which also carry motes of my existence. i have not disappeared. my wife quivers inside a kiss. my pulse was given to her many times,  in many countries. the chunks of bread we dip in olive oil is communion with our ancestors, who also have not disappeared. their delicate songs i wear on my eyelids. their smiles have given me freedom which is a crater i keep falling in. when i bite into the two halves of an orange whose cross-section resembles my lungs,  a delta of juices burst down my chin, and like magic, makes me appear to those who think i've disappeared. it's too bad war makes people disappear like chess pieces, and that prisons turn prisoners into movie endings. when i fade into the mountains on a forest trail, i still have not disappeared, even though its green façade turns my arms and legs into branches of oak. it is then i belong to a southerly wind, which by now you have mistaken as me nodding back and forth like a hasid in prayer or a mother who has just lost her son to gunfire in detroit. i have not disappeared.  in my children, i see my bulging face pressing further into the mysteries.  in a library in tucson, on a plane above buenos aires, on a field where nearby burns a controlled fire, i am held by a professor, a general, and a photographer. one burns a finely wrapped cigar, then sniffs the scented pages of my books, scouring for the bitter smell of control. i hold him in my mind like a chalice. i have not disappeared. i swish the amber hue of lager on my tongue and ponder the drilling rigs in the gulf of alaska and all the oil-painted plovers.  when we talk about limits, we disappear. in jasper, tx you can disappear on a strip of gravel.  i am a life in sacred language. termites toil over a grave, and my mind is a ravine of yesterdays. at a glance from across the room, i wear september on my face, which is eternal, and does not disappear even if you close your eyes once and for all simultaneously like two coffins.

 my father in the aluminum stern, cursing another fouled blood-knot: all the shits  and fucks as integral to the art of fishing as the bait-fish, little silver smelts  i sewed like a manual transmission, the same inbred order and precision  needling the leader through the ass, out the mouth, through the jaw, out the nostril  and back down—suffering as my father suffered the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering johnson  the obligatory dud, orange egg-pearls ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of duds  like every shit-luck setback that drove us on, fed by the huge image of everything  we'd never caught, moving in joint blindness under munsungun. and whatever it was it was the fight that delivered us—a tension  like a sequestered muscle, the line spooling, unspooling, the holy-shit-  litany pulled from our awed mouths contracting with distance until a whole  silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body absorbing and reflecting raw light  like the bit of cornea above a pupil. and then his tremendous, decent hands  brandishing an oar-butt; the brilliant lace of the gills, their crumpled hinge flaring  in bilge water; and the line, whipping and shuttling, feeding invisibly back,  moving on on munsungun, sons survived by the same damn hunt they heired.

 when the first mechanical picker had stripped the field, it left such a copious white dross of disorderly wispiness that my mother could not console herself to the waste and insisted on having it picked over with human hands,  though anyone could see there was not enough for ten sheets and the hands had long since gone into the factories. no matter how often my father pointed this out, she worried it the way i’ve worried the extra words  in poems that i conceived with the approximate notion that each stanza should have the same number of lines and each line the same number of syllables— and disregarded it, telling myself a ripple  or botch on the surface, like the stutter of a speaker, is all i have to affirm the deep fluency below. the hebrews distrusted greek poetry (which embodied harmony and symmetry, and, therefore, revision)  not for aesthetic reasons, but because they believed that to change the first words, which rose unsmelted from the trance, amounted to sacrilege against god. in countries where, because of the gross abundance  of labor, it’s unlawful to import harvesting machines, i see the women in the fields and think of how, when my mother used to pick, you could tell her row by the bare stalks and the scant poundage  that tumbled from her sack so pristinely white and devoid of burrs, it seemed to have already passed through the spiked mandibles of the gin. dr. williams said of eliot that his poems were so  cautiously wrought that they seemed to come to us already digested in all four stomachs of the cow. what my father loved about my mother was not just the beauty of her body and face, but the practice  of her ideas and the intelligence of her hands as they made the house that abides in us still as worry and bother, but also the perfect freedom beyond— as cleanliness is next to godliness but is not god.

 on the metro, i have to ask a young woman to move the packages beside her to make room for me; she’s reading, her foot propped on the seat in front of her, and barely looks up as she pulls them to her. i sit, take out my own book—cioran, the temptation to exist—and notice her glancing up from hers to take in the title of mine, and then, as gombrowicz puts it, she “affirms herself physically,” that is, becomes present in a way she hadn’t been before: though she hasn’t moved, she’s allowed herself to come more sharply into focus, be more accessible to my sensual perception, so i can’t help but remark her strong figure and very tan skin—(how literally golden young women can look at the end of summer.) she leans back now, and as the train rocks and her arm brushes mine she doesn’t pull it away; she seems to be allowing our surfaces to unite: the fine hairs on both our forearms, sensitive, alive, achingly alive, bring news of someone touched, someone sensed, and thus acknowledged, known.  i understand that in no way is she offering more than this, and in truth i have no desire for more, but it’s still enough for me to be taken by a surge, first of warmth then of something like its opposite: a memory—a girl i’d mooned for from afar, across the table from me in the library in school now, our feet i thought touching, touching even again, and then, with all i craved that touch to mean, my having to realize it wasn’t her flesh my flesh for that gleaming time had pressed, but a table leg. the young woman today removes her arm now, stands, swaying against the lurch of the slowing train, and crossing before me brushes my knee and does that thing again, asserts her bodily being again, (gombrowicz again), then quickly moves to the door of the car and descends, not once looking back, (to my relief not looking back), and i allow myself the thought that though i must be to her again as senseless as that table of my youth, as wooden, as unfeeling, perhaps there was a moment i was not.

 uniformly over the whole countryside the warm air flows imperceptibly seaward; the autumn haze drifts in deep bands over the pale water; white egrets stand in the blue marshes; tamalpais, diablo, st. helena float in the air. climbing on the cliffs of hunter’s hill we look out over fifty miles of sinuous interpenetration of mountains and sea.  leading up a twisted chimney, just as my eyes rise to the level of a small cave, two white owls fly out, silent, close to my face. they hover, confused in the sunlight, and disappear into the recesses of the cliff.  all day i have been watching a new climber, a young girl with ash blonde hair and gentle confident eyes. she climbs slowly, precisely, with unwasted grace.  while i am coiling the ropes, watching the spectacular sunset, she turns to me and says, quietly, “it must be very beautiful, the sunset, on saturn, with the rings and all the moons.”

 how easily happiness begins by dicing onions. a lump of sweet butter slithers and swirls across the floor of the sauté pan, especially if its errant path crosses a tiny slick of olive oil. then a tumble of onions.  this could mean soup or risotto or chutney (from the sanskrit chatni, to lick). slowly the onions go limp and then nacreous and then what cookbooks call clear, though if they were eyes you could see  clearly the cataracts in them. it’s true it can make you weep to peel them, to unfurl and to tease from the taut ball first the brittle, caramel-colored and decrepit papery outside layer, the least  recent the reticent onion wrapped around its growing body, for there’s nothing to an onion but skin, and it’s true you can go on weeping as you go on in, through the moist middle skins, the sweetest  and thickest, and you can go on in to the core, to the bud-like, acrid, fibrous skins densely clustered there, stalky and in- complete, and these are the most pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare  and rage and murmury animal comfort that infant humans secrete. this is the best domestic perfume. you sit down to eat with a rumor of onions still on your twice-washed hands and lift to your mouth a hint  of a story about loam and usual endurance. it’s there when you clean up and rinse the wine glasses and make a joke, and you leave the minutest whiff of it on the light switch, later, when you climb the stairs.

 the only mexican that ever was mexican, fought in the revolution and drank nightly, and like all machos, crawled into work crudo,  letting his breath twirl, then clap and sing before sandpaper juiced the metal. the only mexican to never sit in a catholic pew  was born on halloween, and ate his lunch wrapped in foil against the fence with the other mexicans. they fixed old fords where my  grandfather worked for years, him and the welder juan wagered each year on who would return first to the yucatan. neither did.  when my aunts leave, my dad paces the living room and then rests, like a jaguar who once drank rain off the leaves of cecropia trees,  but now caged, bends his paw on a speaker to watch crowds pass. he asks me to watch grandpa, which means, for the day; in town  for two weeks, i have tried my best to avoid this. many times he will swear, and many times grandpa will ask to get in and out of bed, want a sweater,  he will ask the time, he will use the toilet, frequently ask for beer, about dinner, when the padres play, por que no novelas, about bed.  he will ask about his house, grandma, to sit outside, he will question while answering, he will smirk, he will invent languages while tucked in bed.  he will bump the table, tap the couch, he will lose his slipper, wedging it in the wheel of his chair, like a small child trapped in a well, everyone will care.  he will cry without tears—a broken carburetor of sobs. when i speak spanish, he shakes his head, and reminds me, he is the only mexican.

 for my great aunt &amp; jonathan hicks my first venture west was in windows 98 or independence, missouri. class in the computer lab &amp; we were supposed to be playing some typing game or another. the one i remember had a haunted theme. ghosts instructing us on the finer points of where to put our fingers. these were the last days before keyboards as appendage, when typing was not nature. i should’ve been letting an apparition coach me through qwerty but rather i was at the general store deciding between ammo &amp; axles, considering the merits of being a banker or carpenter.  too young to know what profession would get me to the willamette valley in the space of a 40-minute period. i aimed my rifle with the arrow keys, tapped the space bar with a prayer for meat to haul back to the wagon.  this game came difficult as breathing underwater after trying to ford a river.  i was no good at survival. somebody always fell ill or out into the river. each new day scurvy or a raid was the fate of a character named for my crush or my baby sister. this loss i know, how to measure what it means to die premature before a school period ends.  i can’t understand the game coming to a late end. an elderly daughter grieving her elderly mother. reading the expansive obit in a suburban detroit church is a confusing newness.  when the old do the thing the world expects i retreat into my former self. focus on beating video games i’ve always sucked at, brush up on chicago bulls history, re-memorize the backstreet boys catalog, push away whatever woman is foolhardy enough to be on any road with me. i pioneer my way away from all the known world. i look at homicide rates &amp; wish we all expired the way i know best. i pray for a senseless, poetic departure. i pray for my family to not be around to miss me while i’m still here. i want a short obituary, a life brief &amp; unfulfilled, the introductory melody before a beat’s crescendo into song, the game over somewhere in the great plains.  i want to spare my descendants the confusion of watching a flame flicker slow. keep them from being at a funeral thumbing the faded family pictures like worn keys, observing the journey done, the game won, the west conquered.

 to my friends each hair is a poem i gave my son each hair is my allowance from the universe each hair is a sunspot on someone's broken heart  the secrets that emerge from the psyche have no floor they will get off on any floor when you least expect them to they wear shadows that look like my mother she could stop god but could not make it snow she said the weather was a work of art like the last streak of wonder in medea's heart  you don't have to watch human sacrifice on television shut your window lock the door wait for yourself in the corner in the night in the little house that holds your tears  there is no piano just your green velvet and the years you spent in russia as a little box in your mother's womb with all her curses and her dreams of men  when i write poetry i hear voices: kennethkoch rubbing his forehead davidshapiro swatting words frankohara blowing his noise philipbryant smiling upon me neruda drinking red wine lorca hailing a cab in new york vallejo walking in paris ronpadgett calming the world tedberrigan dignifying wise-guy poetry joeceravolo on the radio with melanoma in the milky sky are you asleep? no chopin is asleep on our new sofa he is wasting his life away his health looks like a dirty window his heart has a broken leg his breathing will go to the grave with him  i'm not one to part i'm not one to hide my feelings i'm the end of the corridor in your hands this is a song of war because love is music and its ferocious notes are oars that pull us apart  death is incredible it is man made we change the names of the dead when we bury them in time they look back at us and see us the living like old doors in the wind  in the beginning there were small islands floating on poetry these islands belonged to joe ceravolo joe's words are the body parts of poetry like the little children of the fireflies who set songs on fire when we cry  there is work to do on top of the forest there are too many words on top of the forest they are obscuring our conversation if the trees aren't pruned our words will never reach their destination: the telephones that hate love and protect the dead from living  will my daughter dress like venus wrapped in exaggerated hopes? will the pill invent love for her? will her life take place on a mental and spiritual planet? yes no my daughter is a seed full of steam leaving me behind like a bad marriage helen helen my helen of troy once i placed a kiss on a spider's web because there is no evil in nature the spider laughed now the kiss is as free as an insect and the better part of our love  my other marriages were like the four seasons that come and go they have left me small stones that spend their nights on the balcony of life watching pathos and comedy celebrate their wedding  tonight i will write poetry i will pile the world on my pillow like a paramilitary sous chef toss an avalanche of flowers with sunlight and olive oil.

 nocturnal (horizon line), 2010, by teresita fernández   i’d come to help settle your mother’s affairs. on the last night,  we ate where she worked all her life.now that she’s gone,  you said,i’ll never come back. looking out over the dark, you saw  a light in the distance, a boat crossing the bay, and told  the story of the fisherman cursed to float adrift  forever. you hadn’t thought of it since you were a child, and held  your hand across the table to show me how it trembled.  i didn’t understand until, alone, years later, wandering the city where  i was born, i stood before a black wall, polished to shimmer,  and it looked to me like the sea at night, hard and endless.

 would be coming back from some war, sending back stuffed birds or handkerchiefs in navy blue with love painted on it. some sent telegrams for birthdays, the pastel letters like jewels. the magazines were full of fathers who were doing what had to be done, were serving, were brave. someone yelped there’d be confetti in the streets, maybe no school. that soon we’d have bananas. my father sat in the grey chair, war after war, hardly said a word. i wished he had gone away with the others so maybe he would be coming back to us

 the nightclub’s neon light glows red with anxiety as i wait on the turning lane. cars blur past, their headlights white as charcoal. i trust each driver not to swerve. i trust each stranger not to kill me and let me cross the shadow of his smoky path. trust is all i have for patrons at the bar: one man offers me a line, one man buys the kamikaze, another drinks it. yet another wraps his arm around my waist. i trust him not to harm my body as much as he expects his body to remain unharmed. one man asks me to the dance floor, one asks me to a second drink, another asks me home. i dance, i drink, i follow. i can trust a man without clothes. naked he conceals no weapons, no threat but the blood in his erection. his bed unfamiliar, only temporarily. pillows without loyalty absorb the weight of any man, betray the scent of the men who came before. i trust a stranger’s tongue to tell me nothing valuable. it makes no promises of truth or lies, it doesn’t swear commitments. the stranger’s hands take their time exploring. undisguised, they do not turn to claws or pretend artistic skill to draw configurations on my flesh. they are only human hands with fingertips unsentimental with discoveries, without nostalgia for what they leave behind. i trust this stranger not to stay inside me once he enters me. i trust him to release me from the blame of pleasure. the pain i exit with no greater than the loneliness that takes me to the bar. he says good night, i give him back those words, taking nothing with me that is his. the front door shuts behind me, the gravel driveway ushers me away. the rearview mirror loses sight of threshold, house, sidewalk, street. driving by the nightclub i pass a car impatient on the turning lane. my hands are cold and itch to swerve the wheel, to brand his fender with the fury of my headlights. but i let this stranger live to struggle through the heat and sweat of false affections, anonymous and borrowed like the glass that washed my prints to hold another patron’s drink.  
NEW POEM
 i.  tripartite schemes were all very well for the builders who held their blueprints firmly in hand beforehand. what did it matter if the two vertical poles didn’t touch, seemed so far apart, in fact, that no one who visited the site could believe the architect’s arrogant babble? before they knew it, he’d bridged the two poles with a plank.  i have hidden under these structures of synthetic comfort when the sky was overcast. i have even hired a claque of unemployed actors  to stand there with me. but speaking for myself, i find their tentlike charm diminishing. over on the next hill is a line of poker-faced upright slabs, their bases deep in the dirt, their function something else entirely.   ii.  i keep seeking this pleasure-giving eye mote; you fill your pew and my view with golden uncontrollable emanation and the music surges in response, a coded story of hope and disappointment decipherable to the few. is it wrong to be overheated here, or not to have left my coat at the entrance?  the only crime would be not to swoon, to see and ignore you, or brand you a brother in spotless devotion. beneath the bleeding windows hearts must have heft, masses of skin become human tremors, to feel the force of the organ. on its own the rite is a starchy obligation; add intrigue and the altar ripples and ripples.   iii.  over the hub of the hill, a solid wall of silver leaves. underfoot, soil without burrows. blanketing soil and leaves, a scrim of hushed and unpunctured blue. then all of a sudden, rumors of something about to happen; the night restless with its own unkeepable secrets, the very air strained and achingly electric.  because you are not here, nighttime behaves this way, calling for terms i’d long since put away: susurration, intrigue, reverberant. it is only in your magnanimous absence that stony surroundings can sing your praises so; i curse even as i gape to know that their raving requires your being anywhere else. the evening hums in compensation.   iv.  his beak is open as if in mid-worm or mid-sentence, his feet impressively sturdy as they straddle the street. what gives him away, though, is the magenta pool spreading rapidly under this otherwise unruffled stomach. something ended this bird so suddenly that he never had time to strike a normal death pose.  it would be overdone and untrue to say i am the bird, to paint myself in similar terms as stunted, irretrievably downed, forever rooted to unkind ground. it would smack of self-pity. we are partners instead beneath a general rubric of doom: an arrow descended and brought him, startled, to death, me screamingly to life.   v.  i loved a statue and watered it daily. sooner or later it softened and let me break a vital part of it off; with my hard-won prize in my pocket i explored the streets with a secret, but before long the plundered piece was dust in my hands, and painful to look at.  now another effigy makes me shudder at its criminal threshold. more than ever i entertain a shameless urge to steal or caress it, but the facts of history tell me otherwise: you get what you pray for and the statue dwindles to rubble.   vi.  although others lack the sharpened knives to be villains, they do what they can with blunter instruments. sparring to kill time, falling to fisticuffs when eloquence evades them, they get their day’s entertainment from instruction manuals bought at auctions; when one utters his bored “touché,” a gaggle of fans surround him.  how much deadlier is your collection of swords with a history, scimitars that glint even when strung up and inactive. although i would gladly lay a whetstone at your door for one blinding night of thrust-and-parry, you have no need of anything resembling aid: one twist of your weapon outstabs the meanest ranks of dullard soldiers.   vii.  the avuncular figure with grizzled beard, the bearer of balm for the stricken and abandoned, the craggy but spirited sickle-carrier paces the page of a long-forgotten book of days and never once frowns. there is no need to: our days may be numbered, but . . . (and here his eyes mist over with comforting thoughts of gold and rainbows).  his evil twin wants none of this waiting, this starry-eyed torpor. hoping to scare eternity into submission, he too brandishes a sickle, but everything goes wrong: he pierces his own leg and must go on crutches. before long, he falls into childish fits of self-pity, proffering sickle and leg to hirelings, saying “lop it off, boys, and be quick.”   viii.  during the first stages of frenzy, a glut of meaning descends on nature. as if to spite cynics who call dirt nothing but dirt, terrific breezes mere conveyors of pollen, something in the sufferer’s mind seeks out and finds corroboration in vast planets and puny insects; all are as prone to nervous tics, all whirring with badly kept secrets.  time passes, and the system turn on you. when all is sacred, nothing is safe: silent lampposts suddenly pipe up in irresistible  colloquy a tone too high, the sky calls you but does not want your replies, and water-bound birds decline pronouns in latin. it is a hotbed that cannot stand the addition of an offending presence; it whispers until you are well on your way.   ix.  before you came on the scene and blasted the image to bits, i thought of love as a spacious courtroom where evidence was presented graphically and up front, where deserving plaintiffs got what they wanted legally, and where judges beamed beneath picturesque wigs when they saw happy verdicts amicably arrived at.  these days, law is something to be left at the door along with galoshes; i spend my nights in sinister mock-trial, playing all the parts. “guilty or not?” booms our pot-bellied, exquisitely bored judge. i answer for you: “not, your holiness; this harridan framed me.” and then i object. and then, hunched over in a corner of the courtroom, a juror suggests we all go out to lunch.   x.  it was a run of the mill journey until the windows seemed to have melted; outside the train, the foliage of early summer received an instantaneous drenching. startled, i thought of you like a lovesick heroine out of an old romance: “holding her heart, agawp at nature’s rages, she would watch the storm from inside, and secretly like it.”  no longer dainty hand-to-the-head, the tragic meaningful stare out the window. no storm buffets alone; however stunningly leaves may shudder and press against the pane, it is a wasted downpour if nobody comes out soggy. reaching my stop, i left my cap and trenchcoat inside a locker and headed for the wet jungle, hot on your heels.   xi.  our meeting is as stiff as a long-dead thoroughbred. like its former coat, we too are glossy and brief; no frizzy wire springs up that is not dutifully cropped; our every neigh is strictly by the book; place us in a lineup of similarly frozen stallions, and you will not know one rigor mortis from another and another.  i could endure a salvo of kicking, a brutish uprearing nag, or a vicious race to the finish, over this wingless duo of moribund mares. i could even stand it if you leapt up and started poking holes in my horse metaphor. anything other than the way our speech resembles the two extremes of stunted growth: gorgeous stillborns, cynical has-beens. this is no time for pleasantry!   xii.  i have been dreaming you into the picture when you bound, unseeing, past me. i tingle onward with knees of jelly, glad to be confirmed in my scheming: this walk is no hopeless ramble, but a perfect way of seeing and being seen. fate, sensing my hopes, obligingly guides you outdoors.  what rankles is the time it takes me to realize that you are truly, tangibly here. i have been holding so many secret meetings with you that this brief encounter, this perfect opportunity passes, doesn’t register. i see you in retrospect: you were here, jacket flapping in the noon breeze, and gone by the time i had presence of mind to grasp it.   xiii.  explaining camouflage: a useful way of suiting yourself to your habitat so that you steal its features more than it steals yours; in war, a surefire method of avoiding skirmishes; in love, a vanishing act that lets you watch the object of your affection, in whose vagrant eyes you might as well be a pebble, a flaw on the leaf.  or, a ruinous self-effacement, brainchild of the timid, deserving to be trounced by the rustle in the trees which announces a vital presence, the force which, storming a fortress, subjects its tenant to a scrutiny of his most cherished beliefs, the stunning hybrid you look at once and cannot get out of your mind.   xiv.  hearing you praised is enough to make my overbaked brain a warpath for feuding goddesses. only instead of swords, their messages clash, each one a model of what i might do. on one side, silence, stately in black, shows no sign of unrest: her only response to the beaming crowd is to nod.  on the other side in see-through red, a goddess named outrage deafens her rival with laudatory overdrive; next to her encomia both clean and unclean, the excesses of the laurel-throwers positively began to pale. it is her manner that somehow filters out; the walls start to rumble, the floorboards, feeble at keeping secrets, murmur “swear it.”   xv.  in the handed-down inventory of love’s habits we find images of lowering: down at the mouth, down on the knees, prostrate with the shock of the marvelous. contact more than shame-faced with the elevated figure is therefore impossible; hazard more than a bow, and a trapdoor opens beneath you; offer a hand, and see love disappear.  there is never a mention of the sudden boost the run-down ego receives when, flinging a jest from toad-high levels, it witnesses more than haughty approval. nor is it told how the jest (some minor impromptu line) gets told and retold in the prolonged wake of the moment; seraphs laugh at it, trees love it; you see your dullness shine in another’s eyes.   xvi.  a dream straight out of a textbook: having been tied up and pointed at the wall by a swarthy, hairy- faced thug and her henchman, i hear the incredible shouts as an old babysitter is disemboweled. severed organs flap to the floor like pancakes, but i do not think, “me next,” fearing instead that it will fall on me to clean up the horrible mess.  what can i do, on waking, but clench my stomach in sharp, instinctive need to keep it closed? in wars between the hirsute and the nurturing, nobody dares to cheer for the former, though her company, being moody, is hellishly more alive. will this day or the next bring pearly surfaces to the brink of spilling over? (somewhere the babysitter screams your name.)   xvii.  once a day, you report to the resident loony for clues leading to the whereabouts of the author of a love letter you have received. she is mad but useful, delving as she can into alternate worlds; and as you grill her from the other side of the bars, a strange bond begins to form between you. she seems to have felt as you do.  little do you know that this sibyl is also a relentless self-promoter. she ladles out counsel (“you can tell she wants to be tracked down”) and misinformation (“i think i know where she lives”) like a watery broth that keeps you coming back for the meaty pay-off at the bottom. all this you realize and tolerate, never suspecting that she’s the one you want.   xviii.  when you are within shouting distance it is no matter, or next to none, what you say or whether we speak at all. it is enough to see, and covertly to love, your bright array of colorful traits. they are no sooner parceled out than stored up, secret accounts to be gone over until the whole single-spaced ledger is memorized.  but when you leave, ledgers cannot contain you; time passes and the beloved blurs, the riotous gestures faded in substance, though not in force. i cannot hear your voice if i try; and what do i do when a free-floating affection outraces its visible target? from your splendid outpost that dazzles merely by being yours, send photos.   xix.  abroad, you are a mass of extra shadow falling on all you see. on its own a square is stiff and formidable; walk in it and the arches tremble, the smells from the canal soften and linger. the red of the hills at evening is fit for a postcard home, until you step in the picture—and hand it back to the masters.  it is straight out of a shoddy french novel to squeeze the continents into us/them categories and chapters—mold here, fruit there, stubble in places and wheat in others. think me less a philistine when i say how little the steps of the journey frame you. it is you, torchbearer to shrouded lands, who flood them with living color.   xx.  when i call you to mind, you respond sluggishly if at all. it is as if, being busy, you send a very expensive mannequin in your stead, a robot who dresses and walks like you but cannot capture your puzzling essence. memory loves paradox: the more i require a stand-in, the looser the seams, the phonier the puppet.  but i do not know this until the unexpected happens. sifting my horde of jewels and praising their cut, i come upon a diamond that puts them to shame; catching a glimpse of familiar patterns of color in the street, i realize the cheapness of the household dolls i have been thinking about, relieved that even now, surprises like this put you fleetingly back in the picture.   xxi.  it will be objected that in missing you i forfeit a key to the room reserved for bona fide lovers. there, an air of resolute calm prevails: it is always “our minds are as one, and that is enough,” or “i saw him last night in the shape of a cloud,” or, harder still to believe, “look at the useful machine i built instead of grieving.”  they may brace themselves and speak of the salubrious sublime; they may grit their teeth and bear it; their tourniqueted hearts are as undone as mine. away, you are no homing compass or dove, but a roving, ceaselessly altering scoundrel. to miss you is to miss the loot you add to your repository of noises.   xxii.  horses, birds, babysitters and jails, shadows, churches and trains; one would think you’d sat up with me all night, filling out forms on what images you preferred, or at least been consulted in the matter. failing that, one might suppose you to have stood on the sidelines in mounting horror as, one by one, strange pictures of you took flight.  but you stumbled into this mess of blocks like the bumbling idiot in a screwball comedy. center stage contained in cardboard boxes you tripped over before smiling and wandering on, in your madcap way, to new scrapes. meanwhile, the whirligig thrives in your absence: booted cubes swoon for their muse, a poltergeist in a bowtie.   xxiii.  a spider loved a bee and, knowing that to trap him would be to kill him, devised webs just flashy enough to keep the insect guessing. and soon, seeing in the spider’s handiwork traces of his own flower-hopping, the bee came closer. arachnid vapors wafted over them as the bee proposed to die in the spider’s service.  “no!” screamed the latter, tightening up her floss, and the spurned bee flew on to more accustomed turf—roses and lilies next to whom (he saw) the spider was nothing. but she was not so lucky. the web she’d spun for him got tangled in her post mortem antenna-flailing, and finally wound around her neck and choked her. it was the end of the fable.   xxiv.  the more love grows, the bigger its sealed-off palace becomes, and the more pinched and dark its stoical keeper. inside, sun breeds space: a ray that snuck past the keeper enters a room and lights it— only now there is not one room but many. beams bright as lasers but gentler give away the safe behind the painting, the corridor under the rug.  if only the keeper, hardened by circumstance, could learn from this endless illumination and turn the room inside out. light would then seep through leathery skin, giving its secrets away in a gradually spreading glow, turning skin the orange of pure beatitude. but there are only two options for the keeper: to be charbroiled all at once or eternally silent.   xxv.  then, any enterprise requiring new clothes was privately hissed, if openly hailed; too close to a floral militia thinking as one were the standard frills, the required rustles, and thinking myself a beacon among dark ladies, i called the clothes by their hidden agendas: ethical corsets, trusses of the spirit.  now i cry out for the colorful front of fancy dress, bow down in belated awe before silk and organza. it is not the delusion of being at my best, but the promise of further secrecy that thrills me; these veils only make unveiling all the stranger and wilder, and under my gown claw ghosts you’ll never see.   xxvi.  this sideshow of outlandish images is nothing like the main attractions of another time. just after one picture clicks on and the eyes have adjusted, another, altogether different one takes its place, and another, and another. what in the world is going on? did the projector gather together the uppermost slides on the pile?  nothing could be falser. it is only that the replacement of the reel calls for as many tricks and turns as possible to be an even passable substitute. everything is its field; its lens is a gaping hole with a passion for things encyclopedic. this is the only way it can capture your many angles—small comfort, yet comfort still.   xxvii.  the next time our paths cross there will be none of this shilly-shallying, this bondage, like it or not, to fickle time, brute locale. the crossing itself will slow down the march of the passing moment with its own unstoppable steam, its tenebrous and sultry collection of vapors. it will be love in a bottle.  but there is always a screw loose somewhere, a gap in the glass that lets in a limber array of interlopers. from the mutual friend who smells a levity and wants in, to the premature bonging of the hour, to the false confines of the walls of our houses, there is always a damnable flaw in the system . . . and incoming elves who taunt “excuses, excuses.”   xxviii.  what is it about this flame i label passion that burns the world and its newspapers to a crisp? how can i call myself hungry for the facts of one kind but wince at another? the lover’s room may be an all-white, tiny room with a view of woods, but why, if a well-meaning friend slides a special report under my door, do i look for tongs and a furnace?  because the flame is not only self-infatuated, given to burning documents for the sake of flaunting its own reds, but also in a state of permanent warfare; all worldly flare-ups, all currencies not its own, remind it that amid the worst incendiary horrors, it goes on stoking itself for want of a proper spark.   xxix.  the catechism of the far gone: isn’t it too good to be coincidental that our eyes have looked at that billboard with the same unqualified disgust? can we ignore the fact that you happened to witness the accident only minutes after i did? is there more than just a flimsy link in a story jointly loved, a pastime avoided?  no, yes, and by no means. these are the very traits which, observed in an enemy, get shelved or denied by their once proud possessor. i could pillage an igloo, travel to the torrid antipodes and produce thousands like you, featured like you, like you in raves and complaints. i was bedazzled by a ray of fool’s gold.   xxx.  go, tyrant. in your heart will nest no more desperate slaves. come again, days of productivity, nights of rest and no nightmares. i have spent so much time under the shade of your massive umbrella that i will draw it shut for a minute to see what i once saw, and what i have missed since seeing you. eyes, look unchained around you.  it is a landscape of moldering stones and bones. when the eyes are free to roam, they are not so much free as useless—i see a sky of fledgling clouds and do nothing to help them, peer into the living record of a severed oak and can decipher nothing. return, dark glasses, come again, morbid parasol; only in shade do mountains have features.   xxxi.  in the final tally of divine overseers who will be ours? suppose we claim the moon, whose bottomless bag of stardust enchants a forest of two, softens and shrinks the volume of venomous air between us, and lovingly coats all former fears with beams of forgetful, nourishing light?  our watcher is the moon, but only after a brutal shake-up is through with her. she has never learned the knack of lighting two people at once; instead it is always me illumined, you off in the bushes, you posed in your halo, me waist-deep in darkness. and she is a clumsy goddess for the reason that she borrows (poor moon) what light she has from me.   xxxii.  though you are by definition a slippery freedom, if forced to freeze you in a single image i would call you a beam of light with hidden powers to strike and alter forever. here is a room: regard its monotone grimness. enter your incandescent highness: gladly around you objects sparkle, knowing a beam when they see it.  next to your flawless arc i am a damaged bulb in a fleabag hotel, clattering on to reveal paintings on velvet and objets trouvés(but where?), rattling off to plunge the run-down room into dark desuetude. what if we pooled our forces? would we stand together like heartless neon sculpture or deck ourselves in loving chiaroscuro?   xxxiii.  perfect, you say? it is enough to make me perform operations on myself in order to test your love: taking in the wreckage, you would be forced to say “yes, gouging out one eye makes the other shine all the brighter; the smell of your fungus reminds me of summer; your leprous stump is a modish charmer since, after all, green is my favorite color.”  and yet, for all our tirades against deception, how easily do we succumb to the lover’s flattery, and with what treachery. if i am perfect, it is only by being perfect that you, myopic, dependable you can keep me; so go on, keep on calling me faultless, come on, hurry up with my supper, leave me, and come back at midnight, but don’t come back if you hear a noise in the room.   xxxiv.   still the inveterate skulker, the ghost of chaos past, i have come back to the place where it all began, where leaving, you gave me leave to see you wherever i went— in the home, in the wild, in the sky, in the gutter— and where columns, scribbled on and abandoned, took one look at my raving, and rose again.  strangest of all is that, given the chance to see my subject in the fabulous flesh at last, i would flatly refuse. these barren days when i heat my room by the fading coals of my goals, this ache for an ache is as good as it gets, so go on running; i will go on looking for you as the willow bends, as the stomach hunts for the ulcer.

 the very flatness of portraits makes for nostalgia in the connoisseur.  here’s the latest little lip of wave to flatten and spread thin.  let’s say it shows our recklessness,  our fast gun,  our self-consciousness which was really  our infatuation with our own fame,  our escapes,  the easy way we’d blend in  with the peasantry,  our loyalty to our old gang  from among whom it was our nature  to be singled out

 past the congested interstate, past the long lines outside the dorothy day center, past the cheering bleachers, the steam rising from the coach’s face, the fathers straining in prayer,  past the rusting letters on the marquee, the dim lights along main, the couples who will fuck during the movie &amp; the couples who won’t, past the frozen orchard, past the defaced statue of a saint, a dog  chews thin the leather cord around his neck. the opposite of hunger is not satisfaction, it is birth. it is what makes a man chisel a face into stone. it is what drives the body to lie in the fresh snow. it is what quiets the world  when she pulls you in close. it is the winning pass, the crowd too busy counting down to notice. the world puts its mouth on you &amp; you don’t say a thing. the world digs a hole in your yard  &amp; it’s up to you to fill it, up to you to find something useful to do with your sadness. strange, the yellow beetle, dried between the pages of the dictionary, staining the page  with its flattened body — its outline, a dirty halo circling the word pleased— please, you’ve circled the same two blocks in search of a place to park, circled the yard howling a name that won’t respond,  but you still think you know enough to call that enough? the boat smacks against the dock it’s tied to. your mother fixes your father’s tie before closing the casket.  everyone you loved refused to die in this town before they died in this town. the woman beside you on the plane wants to know where you’re going.

 for 1995 it was the dead center of summer, &amp; anyone but us would’ve been outside hours ago, flailing  like a system of larks against the hydrant’s icy spray. but a girl had her orders, &amp; to disobey  our mother was, in a sense, to invite one’s own destruction, cause to pray that a god of mercy might strike first.  so we lay, still as stars on the living room floor, poring over algorithms: divisors &amp; dividends,quotient  the first synonym for resolution i ever learned, &amp; would later come to love for its sound alone,  how it reminded me, even then, of words like quantum&amp;quotation mark, both ways of saying nothing  means what you think it means all the time. the observable universe hides behind its smooth  obsidian dress, &amp; all we can do is grasp at it in myths &amp; figures, see what sticks,  give all our best language to the void. what dark irony, these coy, child philosophers,  theorizing how things break from the floor of a house where everything is more  or less in flux, indeterminate as the color of the blood in a body. or the speed  at which i learned to obliterate the distance between myself  &amp; any given boy on the block, the optimal angle of the swing  most likely to drop another kid cold in front of his crew,  to square up, square off, &amp; this too was a kind of education, the way  my sister held both fists semi-adjacent, each an inch or so from her switchblade  eyes, showed me the stance you take when the math doesn’t  quite shake out, so it’s just you &amp; the unknowns &amp; the unknowns  never win.

 in october of the year, he counts potatoes dug from the brown field, counting the seed, counting the cellar’s portion out, and bags the rest on the cart’s floor.  he packs wool sheared in april, honey in combs, linen, leather tanned from deerhide, and vinegar in a barrel hooped by hand at the forge’s fire.  he walks by his ox’s head, ten days to portsmouth market, and sells potatoes, and the bag that carried potatoes, flaxseed, birch brooms, maple sugar, goose feathers, yarn.  when the cart is empty he sells the cart. when the cart is sold he sells the ox, harness and yoke, and walks home, his pockets heavy with the year’s coin for salt and taxes,  and at home by fire’s light in november cold stitches new harness for next year’s ox in the barn, and carves the yoke, and saws planks building the cart again.

 it was a green barn coat from l. l. bean that he had ordered, thinking of her walking the snowy hillside of his dream though she detested the style and color.  that it arrived two days after he died did not dispose her to detest it less though she may have wished she did, the way she wished she’d kept house  more neatly or baked instead of fried, for every coronary’s a latent homicide— if not what we did, what we did not do. if not what we said, what we did not say.  in this, the inner jury’s always out, no different for man or woman— for everyone over forty, the human condition is grief complicated by guilt.  it’s unexceptional really, what’s left after deaths. we’re thrown back on our own taste. that coat, for instance. if that was a gift, she would have to hide to throw it away.

 ere on my bed my limbs i lay, it hath not been my use to pray with moving lips or bended knees; but silently, by slow degrees, my spirit i to love compose, in humble trust mine eye-lids close, with reverential resignation no wish conceived, no thought exprest, only a sense of supplication; a sense o'er all my soul imprest that i am weak, yet not unblest, since in me, round me, every where eternal strength and wisdom are.  but yester-night i prayed aloud in anguish and in agony, up-starting from the fiendish crowd of shapes and thoughts that tortured me: a lurid light, a trampling throng, sense of intolerable wrong, and whom i scorned, those only strong! thirst of revenge, the powerless will still baffled, and yet burning still! desire with loathing strangely mixed on wild or hateful objects fixed. fantastic passions! maddening brawl! and shame and terror over all! deeds to be hid which were not hid, which all confused i could not know whether i suffered, or i did: for all seemed guilt, remorse or woe, my own or others still the same life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame.  so two nights passed: the night's dismay saddened and stunned the coming day. sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me distemper's worst calamity. the third night, when my own loud scream had waked me from the fiendish dream, o'ercome with sufferings strange and wild, i wept as i had been a child; and having thus by tears subdued my anguish to a milder mood, such punishments, i said, were due to natures deepliest stained with sin,— for aye entempesting anew the unfathomable hell within, the horror of their deeds to view, to know and loathe, yet wish and do! such griefs with such men well agree, but wherefore, wherefore fall on me? to be loved is all i need, and whom i love, i love indeed.

 if there is a word in the lexicon of love, it will not declare itself. the nature of words is to fail men who fall in love with men.  it will not declare itself, the perfect word.boyfriend seems ridiculous: men who fall in love with men deserve something a bit more formal.  the perfect word? boyfriend? ridiculous. but partner is . . . businesslike— we deserve something a bit less formal, much more in love with love.  but if partner is businesslike, then lover suggests only sex, is too much in love with love. there is life outside of the bedroom,  and lover suggests only sex. we are left with roommate, or friend. there is life, but outside of the bedroom. my friend and i rarely speak of one another.  to my left is my roommate, my friend. if there is a word in the lexicon of love, my friend and i rarely speak it of one another. the nature of words is to fail.  
NEW POEM
 today i woke and believed in nothing. a grief at once intimate and unfelt, like the death of a good friend’s dog.   tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue i praise the day. i don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant like the mindless mindfulness specialist who at the terminal cancer convention (not that it was called that) exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters (ditto) to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive. (the chicken glistened.) nor do i mean a day devoid of past and future as craved that great craze of minds and times fernando pessoa, who wanted not “the present” but reality itself, things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them. time is in the table at which i sit and in the words i type. in the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear when she was gardening and which i kept because it held her smell (though it does no longer) there is still plenty of time.   two murderers keep their minds alive while they wait to die. they talk through slots in their doors of whatever mercy or misery the magazine has ordained for the day — the resurgence of the taliban in afghanistan, say, ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks. when their communion flags, as communions will, they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions, humor. this is a true story, one of them says sometimes by way of preface, as if that gave the moment more gravity, asked of the listener a different attention, at once resisted and reinforced an order wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace, and every death is by design.   “love is possible for anyone,” i hear the tv talk-show host say, which is true in the way most things in this life are true, which is to say, false, unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt. love is possible for anyone because it is equally impossible for everyone. to be is to be confronted with a void, a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls. once known — known by the void, i mean — one has three choices. walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe. walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you. are you with me, love?    (for love read faith.)    naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “die, vermin, die!” banging the broomstick over and over on the floor so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself. this is my mother’s story, though i was there, i’m told, and no small part of the pandemonium. we were five souls crammed into one life, and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it, and not with irony but in earnest ignorance, just as like meant lack, as in “how much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?” and just as i and every other child i knew, before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie, solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off. ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap (“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old scot still say). when do we first know? that there’s a world to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly, but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else? heaven is over. or hell. did you forget the rat? it thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast, and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens is empty. what happens when we die, every child of every father eventually asks. what happens when we don’t is the better question.   to kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed. my brother who is other has a mind of lead. i with my stinging griefs watch from away. how can it be there are no adults left? what matters here is timing, not time. his hand is high and white above the blue. a wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch. even wings are not a clean distinction. down comes the slap like a rifle shot. what vengeance can there be on blank necessity? my brother who is other has a way. his hand is high and white. and then it’s not.    once when my father’s mother’s health was failing and she found it more and more difficult to tend to the tiny family plot at champion, texas, which is less town than time at this point, a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver flashes past, i took it upon myself to salt the graves as i must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths. as indeed it did. in the months after, every sunday when we spoke, she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness, (my words, of course) this new ease i had allowed her mind. until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother tumbled right down among the bones of the woman from whom she’d first emerged. to see that image you have to be that sky. it has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue that is so deeply in you that it is not you. “o, law’, honey, i like to died.”   you don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you. some shell themselves with wealth. some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a jesus lizard. but for those whose souls have known true want — whose souls perhaps are true want — money remains, in some sense, permanently inert, like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain. in 1980 my father bought his first airplane, a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside, which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone. unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives, then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire that was his aspect and atmosphere. homes, schemes, thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!) that did not, it turned out, exist. a hole is hard to carry.   people ask if i believe in god and the verb is tedious to me. not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing. tedious. today i saw a hawk land on elizabeth’s chimney. it sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast above the proud houses of hamden. are you with me? then see, too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue (or so it seems) to be a pigeon fluttering dumbly down next to that implacable raptor, suddening a world of strange relations wherein there is no need for fear, or far, or meat.   there was a man made of airplane parts, one of which was always missing. he wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder, an aileron, or some other fragment that would let him fly from this place where he was not meant to be. there was a woman who emitted invective ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine. one timid gentleman saved saran wrap for five full years and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull of the first soul he saw the dawn god blessed his weapon. (a success story, alas.) another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes. (ditto.) my father moved among them like a father. he attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled. late to the trade, he worked too much, and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should, but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.   for love read faith into these lines that so obviously lack it. for love let words turn to life in the way life turns to world under the observer’s eye, the swirl of particles with their waves and entanglements, their chance and havoc, resolving into some one thing: a raptor on a rooftop, say. no power on earth can make it stay. but is it lost or released into formlessness when we look away?   to be is to believe that the man or woman who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphy fuck da money—trust no one on the rough blanket of the residential motel where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor that left my father, whom i had not seen in years, and i, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself, erupting in laughter until we cried.   before my good friend’s good dog died ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his “to confirm the world and her place in it.” now she won’t even say his name. strange how the things that burn worst in one heart one must keep silent to keep.   ten to one you thought of men. the murderers, i mean. but no. this is a true story. there is another cell, you see, in which a woman i have known since childhood, and since childhood have known to be suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless, lies on the cold stone floor. she is even more naked than they have made her. she has killed no one not even herself. punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here, her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open, pondering the parable of perfect silence.   remember, he said,memory is a poor man’s prison. make to have and to love one live infinitive

 the greeks are sitting on the beach wondering what to do when the war ends. no one wants to go home, back to that bony island; everyone wants a little more of what there is in troy, more life on the edge, that sense of every day as being packed with surprises. but how to explain this to the ones at home to whom fighting a war is a plausible excuse for absence, whereas exploring one’s capacity for diversion is not. well, this can be faced later; these are men of action, ready to leave insight to the women and children. thinking things over in the hot sun, pleased by a new strength in their forearms, which seem more golden than they did at home, some begin to miss their families a little, to miss their wives, to want to see if the war has aged them. and a few grow slightly uneasy: what if war is just a male version of dressing up, a game devised to avoid profound spiritual questions? ah, but it wasn’t only the war. the world had begun calling them, an opera beginning with the war’s loud chords and ending with the floating aria of the sirens. there on the beach, discussing the various timetables for getting home, no one believed it could take ten years to get back to ithaca; no one foresaw that decade of insoluble dilemmas—oh unanswerable affliction of the human heart: how to divide the world’s beauty into acceptable and unacceptable loves! on the shores of troy, how could the greeks know they were hostages already: who once delays the journey is already enthralled; how could they know that of their small number some would be held forever by the dreams of pleasure, some by sleep, some by music?

 i find i am descending in a propeller plane upon pasco in the state of washington. i accept this; i have reasons for participating in the experiential sequence that has brought me here. down below the land is printed with huge circles, doubtless an irrigation system, doubtless it makes sense. there are people who understand it living with dignity in square houses and the result possibly is one billion radishes. now some so-called time has passed. this nation is a huge nation in which the infinity of for example washington state is just one segment of an even less thinkable hugeness and yet zim zim zim zim united airlines has me here in my eastern metropolis with its ten thousand makers of third-rate pizza uncannily far from the possible radishes of washington state. the taxi driver experiments with narrow streets to shorten our detour caused by sports fans and he says the eagles will out-tough the steelers. i defer to his judgment, i am conserving my powers. after “a while” i have this unsettlingly smooth tuna salad with a pale pickle in a drugstore designed by dwight d. eisenhower, reading a few poems by david rivard. i have thoughts. i have my uncle ralph’s jacket soft and droopy giving me a sense of the past. the rain out there on the roofs of retail outlets is saying no guarantee and in a way i am nowhere, in another way maybe definitely not. in a wide wet parking lot i turn back toward the store to explain to the cashier that she charged me for six cans of seltzer when in fact i only had one from a six-pack but the idea of justice seems so fatiguing i would rather read a surprisingly serious detective novel so i vibrate with indecision in the parking lot till all the car windows rattle imperceptibly. then an alleged interval ostensibly intervenes, at the mall a woman at a piano has played 1800 songs from memory according to the radio personality who stands with a mike explaining her bid for the guinness book of records. i am walking away at an unplanned angle singing “tiny montgomery” which i bet she wouldn’t have been ready to play. i have this inner life, i think of my father lonely in vermont, i think of myself lonely in syracuse and my old poem about a detective who can’t solve his biggest case and as a result i have feelings—but my teacher said the future of american poetry can’t be merely the notation of sensibility. when he said that i felt a chilly fear at the edge of consc-consc-consc-consciousness like an ice cube in the corner of my stomach. that’s how i felt. so then, so then consequently i thought “i must gather up some serious ideas” but then ashberry phoned and left a message after the beep. “don’t be a sucker, ideas are where it isn’t.” this made my throat get sort of dry so i drank a classic coke and then another classic coke two hours later as time so-to-say passed. what was always there? texture, that’s what, how it was/is, the how of how; when i pick up my color prints at the camera shop the disappointment i always feel is actually a blessing is it not? i can say “i’ll go along with this charade until i can think my way out” even though i’ll never think my way out. i’ve come this far; that day in 1971 i hitchhiked all the way to montpelier didn’t i? and here i am. suddenly i have a son who focuses with tremendous insistence upon dogs, balloons, air conditioners, hats, clocks, and noses. to him i convey that the world is okay: life is good: we accept it. your dad is a little mixed up but your shoes got tied, right? as barbara cohen in high school said about politics it’s interesting, giving the word four earnest syllables, in-ter-est-ing.

 they explained to me the bloody bandages on the floor in the maternity ward in rochester, n.y., cured the backache i acquired bowing to my old master, made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed.  they showed me an officer on horseback, waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse and a barefoot woman in a nightgown, throwing stones after him and calling him lucifer.  i was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls. come dark a chicken would roost in my hair. some even laid eggs as i played my ukulele and my mother and father crossed themselves.  next, i saw myself inside an abandoned gas station constructing a spaceship out of a coffin, red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers, when a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear.  some days, however, they opened door after door, always to a different room, and could not find me. there’d be only a small squeak now and then, as if a miner’s canary got caught in a mousetrap.

 i am always hungry &amp; wanting to have sex. this is a fact. if you get right down to it the new unprocessed peanut butter is no damn good &amp; you should buy it in a jar as always in the largest supermarket you know. and i am an enemy of change, as you know. all the things i embrace as new are in fact old things, re-released: swimming, the sensation of being dirty in body and mind summer as a time to do nothing and make no money. prayer as a last re- sort. pleasure as a means, and then a means again with no ends in sight. i am absolutely in opposition to all kinds of goals. i have no desire to know where this, anything is getting me. when the water boils i get a cup of tea. accidentally i read all the works of proust. it was summer i was there so was he. i write because i would like to be used for years after my death. not only my body will be compost but the thoughts i left during my life. during my life i was a woman with hazel eyes. out the window is a crooked silo. parts of your body i think of as stripes which i have learned to love along. we swim naked in ponds &amp; i write be- hind your back. my thoughts about you are not exactly forbidden, but exalted because they are useless, not intended to get you because i have you &amp; you love me. it’s more like a playground where i play with my reflection of you until you come back and into the real you i get to sink my teeth. with you i know how to relax. &amp; so i work behind your back. which is lovely. nature is out of control you tell me &amp; that’s what’s so good about it. i’m immoderately in love with you, knocked out by all your new white hair  why shouldn’t something i have always known be the very best there is. i love you from my childhood, starting back there when one day was just like the rest, random growth and breezes, constant love, a sand- wich in the middle of day, a tiny step in the vastly conventional path of the sun. i squint. i wink. i take the ride.

 matthew xiii i know the ways of learning; both the head and pipes that feed the press, and make it run; what reason hath from nature borrowed, or of itself, like a good huswife, spun in laws and policy; what the stars conspire, what willing nature speaks, what forc'd by fire; both th'old discoveries and the new-found seas, the stock and surplus, cause and history; all these stand open, or i have the keys: yet i love thee.  i know the ways of honour; what maintains the quick returns of courtesy and wit; in vies of favours whether party gains when glory swells the heart and moldeth it to all expressions both of hand and eye, which on the world a true-love-knot may tie, and bear the bundle wheresoe'er it goes; how many drams of spirit there must be to sell my life unto my friends or foes: yet i love thee.  i know the ways of pleasure; the sweet strains the lullings and the relishes of it; the propositions of hot blood and brains; what mirth and music mean; what love and wit have done these twenty hundred years and more; i know the projects of unbridled store; my stuff is flesh, not brass; my senses live, and grumble oft that they have more in me than he that curbs them, being but one to five: yet i love thee.  i know all these and have them in my hand; therefore not seeled but with open eyes i fly to thee, and fully understand both the main sale and the commodities; and at what rate and price i have thy love, with all the circumstances that may move. yet through the labyrinths, not my grovelling wit, but thy silk twist let down from heav'n to me did both conduct and teach me how by it to climb to thee.

 i have met people who, asked after their names, shyly—as if they had no title to an appellation all to themselves— replied “fräulein christian” and added: “like the first name,” they wanted to make it easy for the other, not a difficult name like “popiol” or “babendererde”— “like the first name”—please, don’t burden your memory overmuch!  i have met people who grew up in a single room with their parents and four brothers and sisters, and studied at night with their fingers in their ears at the kitchen table, and grew up to be beautiful and self-possessed as duchesses— and innerly gentle and hard-working as nausicaa, clear-browed as angels.  i have often asked myself and never found an answer whence kindness and gentleness come, i don’t know it to this day, and now must go myself.

 it doesn’t matter when i cross. two seconds and they’re gone. the ferry facing ulus. the trees that spanked of green. the narrow bags of temples. beyond that – just – these peri scenes  when the human body sweats the skin produce an oil  when peri bodies sweat it does not produce the oil  the ropes fall to the pavement their waters slap me still their green glow sweats into the pavement waters slap me still –  i could curl among the roses  i would make an aqualung  we will reach the edge of this walk soon. all lights torn out for fuel.  move my fingers in the dark  awoke without a start. peri here – my name is peri –  my name is perihan

 1  i seek a permanent home, but this structure has an appearance of indifferent compoundedness and isolation, heading toward hopelessness.  the boy pulls an animal on a leash.  the house with a red roof rests between two hills.  i can look through its windows to the sea.  his aggression opposes what in a domestic animal, cold open space, large enough to work with isolation?  house is the projection, space around it intermediary, theater.  you don’t have to consume the space to exist, distance, point-to-point, in which a beloved ruin is middle ground, for example.    2  first house and space negate one another.  then, they’re a series.  the boy watches a mouse run around the rim of a lampshade.  he relates wanting to catch a mouse with the room, ground.  wanting a master image obscures ground, like objects in space.  house and space are composite, like my dream, a bubble, lightning, starting point and any second place.    3  rain pours out a gutter onto the poor horse.  horse runs under a tin roof supported by poles.  stockpiles of beams, salvaged wood, brick melt into contextless waste.  i understand the situation by perceiving parts, one after another, then reversing in a glance that removes time.  so, i can intuit contextless waste as ground.    4  the water tank sits on a frame of used wood, like a packing crate.  i look through it to an extinct volcano.  the panorama is true figuratively as space, and literally in a glass wall, where clouds appear like flowers, and the back-lit silhouette of a horse passes by.  a file of evergreens secures the cliff amid debris from a crew bilding, as at the edge of the sea.  oranges, dumplings, boiled eggs take on the opaque energy of a stranger.  knowledge as lintel, bond beam (model signs) holds the world at a distance.  a master image like bone condenses from the indistinct point-to-point feeling of self with which construction began.  my house returns from outside, as if my spirit had been blocking my path, when i wasn’t going anywhere in particular.    5  materials and freedom combine, so materials aren’t subjective.  the material of space is like having a skeleton to gain a vantage point on seamless distance, as in a comparison.  it’s a style of accumulating materials that does not become a solid thing, anymore.  accommodating a view by being able to be seen through is perceptual, not abstract, like space painted white.  give a house the form of an event.  relate it to something there, a form of compassion.  your point of view is: it’s solid already, so there’s warmth.  in this primitive situation, pure form translates a former empire of space as wilderness.  chinese space breaks free from the view in front of me, while my house continues to rotate on earth.  
NEW POEM
 i have seen eternity and it is like this, a man and woman dancing in a bar in a poor street on an unswept floor.  it clings and plots and is desperate, at a point between violence and abjection, between warmth and agoraphobic fear.  let me reverse this and accept the fear. let me drop all objections to abjection, since life itself  is desperate  and has to tread the unswept floor carefully, lovingly, while the bar hovers in eternity. like this.

 “that all these dyings may be life in death” i was living in san francisco my heart was in manhattan it made no sense, no reference point hearing the sad horns at night, fragile evocations of female stuff the 3 tones (the last most resonant) were like warnings, haiku-muezzins at dawn the call came in the afternoon “frank, is that really you?”  i'd awake chilled at dawn in the wooden house like an old ship stay bundled through the day sitting on the stoop to catch the sun i lived near the park whose deep green over my shoulder made life cooler was my spirit faltering, grown duller? i want to be free of poetry's ornaments, its duty, free of constant irritation, me in it, what was grander reason for being? do it, why? (why, frank?) to make the energies dance etc.  my coat a cape of horrors i'd walk through town or impending earthquake. was that it? ominous days. street shiny with hallucinatory light on sad dogs, too many religious people, or a woman startled me by her look of indecision near the empty stadium i walked back spooked by my own darkness then frank called to say “what? not done complaining yet? can't you smell the eucalyptus, have you never neared the pacific? ‘while frank and free/call for musick while your veins swell’” he sang, quoting a metaphysician "don't you know the secret, how to wake up and see you don't exist, but that does, don't you see phenomena is so much more important than this? i always love that.” “always?” i cried, wanting to believe him “yes.” “but say more! how can you if it's sad &amp; dead?” “but that's just it! if! it isn't. it doesn't want to be do you want to be?” he was warming to his song “of course i don't have to put up with as much as you do these days. these years. but i do miss the color, the architecture, the talk. you know, it was the life! and dying is such an insult. after all i was in love with breath and i loved embracing those others, the lovers, with my body.” he sighed &amp; laughed he wasn't quite as i'd remembered him not less generous, but more abstract did he even have a voice now, i wondered or did i think it up in the middle of this long day, phone in hand now dialing manhattan

 we dine at adorno and return to my beauvoir. she compliments me on my bachelard pad. i pop in a santayana cd and saussure back to the couch. on my way, i pull out two fine kristeva wine glasses. i pour some merleau-ponty and return the aristotle to descartes. after pausing an unamuno, i wrap my arm around her hegel. her hair smells of wild lukacs and labriola. our small talk expands to include dewey, moore and kant. i confess to her what's in my eckhart. we locke. by this point, we're totally blavatsky. we stretch out on the schopenhauer. she slips out of her lyotard and i fumble with my levi-strauss. she unhooks her buber and i pull off my spinoza. i run my finger along her heraclitus as she fondles my bacon. she stops to ask me if i brought any kierkegaard. i nod. we foucault. she lights a cigarette and compares foucault to lacan. i roll over and derrida.

 i was one year old when my nanny went away leaving no memory of a face that watched, arms that held, hands that fed and cleaned me, left no record of her voice or name. my father died, leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory.  my mother went away to write in london, left me at her home place, ballyrankin, a sheltered farm in the slaney river valley. i listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire.  statia cooked every day for the dining room, churned butter, gave sugared bread to me and her child bernie, fed outside men in dirty boots and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that smelt of damp clothes, roasting meat, and cake.  i fished for minnows in shillelagh stream under ash trees where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water. on one side horses grazed and swished their tails at flies, on the far side cows rubbed their backs against low beech tree branches.  my mother went away to hospital, left me with english neighbors, the smythe vigours’ hairy legs banged on passage floorboards, my bedroom filled with evening sun. they warned against crying. i cried louder.  they took my pearl pink rosary beads given to me by a monk from a mountain monastery. he told me holy mary answered children’s prayers. a protestant child, i didn’t know the words, but i knew she’d hear me if i could catch the sunlight on her beads.

 at night chinamen jump on asia with a thump  while in our willful way we, in secret, play  affectionate games and bruise our knees like china’s shoes.  the birds push apples through grass the moon turns blue,  these apples roll beneath our buttocks like a heath  full of chinese thrushes flushed from china’s bushes.  as we love at night birds sing out of sight,  chinese rhythms beat through us in our heat,  the apples and the birds move us like soft words,  we couple in the grace of that mysterious race.

 the stroll from my cell along the path above the donkeys past a door open, a door shut and a strong smell of wood and cigarettes ends where music helps white marguerites cut through the masonry. * dark for words with a clicking wren a yellow tit and over the clover a shovel and a rustle of grain. he’s training calves with shouts and food to follow him to another field before the second bell. * broom loops over the buttercups. these names give birth to cones and needles, ferns with mini-sacs of pollen attached. it only takes one shot of spittle on green for my brother to explain the sexual life of the forest and honeybees. * simon says he would like to live alone in a cottage with a garden, no humans, no obligations.  solitary i prefer a pod while he likes hives. we confess we both wear armor outside our habitats. * water was our first armor before our skin. then came the bristle of sunshine. and a thickening of blood into oil or syrup in the lower veins. * i hate the thistledown covering my prototype now interior layer cowering at power or shout, but can laugh with the one who has sap under his skin pouring the bucket the hand is carrying. * brother, help me find an animal who will rescue me from sharp delirium of fear beyond armor and my friends the birds by an open window:  to be clear would be wonderful. a sigh without the ghostly gasps that accompany a certain voice. still i still do desire more of the kind no one can see or hear. not that second, rasping breath of triumph. find me instead more like the breathy saint bernard. but a little dog a cask of brandy hanging at his neck

 the day gets slowly started. a rap at the bedroom door, bitter coffee, hot cereal, juice the color of sun which isn’t out this morning. a cool shower, a shave, soothing noxzema for razor burn. a bed is made. the paper doesn’t come until twelve or one. a gray shine out the windows. “no one leaves the building until those scissors are returned.” it’s that kind of a place. nonetheless, i’ve seen worse. the worried gray is melting into sunlight. i wish i’d brought my book of enlightening literary essays. i wish it were lunch time. i wish i had an appetite. the day agrees with me better than it did, or, better, i agree with it. i’ll slide down a sunslip yet, this crass september morning.

 rachel sherwood 1954-1979  "what can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died?" —erich segal, love story the first time we talked was in the rooftop cafeteria at cal state northridge. misplaced poets, we sat amidst a crop of clean-cut freshmen while, round the college, smog-smudged san fernando valley beckoned, panoramic and bland. i’d just returned from my debauched year up north—sad, drunken sex at the baths, in dark parks. you still yearned for st. david’s, your stint as a foreign exchange student. in wales, something fearless woke you up: you drank, wrote, fucked. now, stuck in the suburbs, we talked poets, punk rock. this was the late seventies, disco’s zenith. we both wanted to look like patti smith.  we both wanted to look like patti smith on her horses album: disheveled, pale, thin, intense. you were scanning meredith’s “modern love” for british lit. i thought stale anyone before sexton. you laughed, threw back your head. i puffed a marlboro light. in truth, you were too hearty, and i too uptight, to do punk. i praised, as twilight dimmed the gray valley, a poem you’d read at the student reading: a pitcher cracks, foreshadows a car crash. the skyline bled behind you. i’d also read that night—racked with stage fright, trembling uncontrollably. you seemed at ease, more confident than me.  you seemed at ease, more confident than me, more independent. lived on amigo avenue with a roommate, a moody science major; and your alter ego, a tomcat named baby tubbs. still at home, i had no wheels. you drove a battered white hatchback full of newspapers, beer cans, comb, brush, books—half wastebasket, half purse. one night early on, we split a fifth of scotch, spread your tarot cards on the living room floor. you predicted long life for me, then said of yourself: “i might make twenty-five.” your roommate walked by, shot a look. later, i passed out beneath lord byron’s watchful eye.  passed out beneath lord byron’s watchful eye— the poster tacked above your secondhand couch—i dreamt i was falling down the side of a mountain, a scarecrow, twisted and limp, limbs ripped, bouncing from rock to rock. on every wall an idol: toulouse-lautrec cancan in kitchen, young chatterton’s wan figure over your desk. shuffling the deck, you asked the same question, drew the same black card: death. together we consulted all your oracles: ouija board, zodiac, i ching, palm, a fickle magic 8 ball. hoping for more time, you inquired, believed like a convict praying for a reprieve.  like a convict praying for a reprieve, you were more alive than the complacent suburbanites i despised. drunk and peeved at the world, i started an argument that ended with you hurling a full coors at me as i fumed down your stairs. four weeks passed before we spoke, a rift i endured by writing a poem about the freak- ish night a black cloud followed us—we lit candles, toasted oblivion. battle scarred, we entered the undergraduate poetry contest at northridge. daniel halpern guest judged...or was it may swenson? after your death, i’d be happy you won.  what can you say about a twenty-five- year-old girl who died? that as a child she loved horses. and dogs. and cats. that monty python made her laugh. that she was alive to the disruptions of her time. that she liked byron, rod stewart, mozart, waugh, poe, keats, the cars. that she lived on amigo and was my friend. that she once threw her keys in anger; once threw a new yorker, shout- ing “i hate john ashbery!” and that she once, after a speed- and scotch-fueled orgy— some girls blasting, her last boyfriend passed out beside us—straddled, rode me like a horse. rachel, can i say this: your cunt felt coarse.  after your death, i’d be happy you won the contest—at least you had that. “don’t turn on me,” you pleaded. losing wasn’t fun, but i couldn’t begrudge you your prize. burned out from an abortion, a vicious bite— a german shepherd lunged at your nose, slit its tip—and a violent unrequit- ed affair with your “don j,” a closet case obsessed with kerouac, you spoke of making a change. by then it was summer: blondie on the car radio, fourth of july, craving fireworks. i remember headlights; reaching for the steering wheel, you. next thing i knew, i woke in icu.  next thing i knew, i woke in icu: machines beeping around me, doctors and nurses hovering in an eerie blue light. tube down my throat, i scrawled, with bruised hand, your name, question mark. my sister was steered in, wept to tell you were dead. the night they moved me to a private room, you appeared, pulsating white presence, in the hallway outside my door. “i’m all right,” you said, “you don’t have to worry about me.” i’d lie there in traction for six weeks, almost two decades ago, a ghost that fell from my own scarecrow dream, numb to that deadly drop. the first time we talked was on a rooftop.  
NEW POEM
 to w.s. merwin i said, “nothing for the last time.” you said, “everything for the last time.” later i thought you made everything more precious with “everything for the last time”: the last meditation, the last falling asleep, the last dream before the final makebelieve, the last kiss good night, the last look out the window at the last moonlight. last leaves no time to hesitate. i would drink strong coffee before my last sleep. i’d rather remember childhood, rehearse forgiveness, listen to birdsong or a spanish housemaid singing, scrubbing a tiled floor in seville— i’d scrub and sing myself.o susanna susanna, quanta pena mi costi. i would strangle the snakes of lastness like herakles in his crib before i cocked my ear to mozart for the last time. there is not sky or clouds enough to cover the music i would hear for the last time. i know a bank whereon the wild thyme of everything for the last time grows, covered with deadly nightshade and poison hemlock.  no last, no first, thinking in the moment, years ago, you prepared the soil in hawaii before you planted your palm trees, then shared most of your days and nights with them as equals. you built your house with a zen room. i made no prayer when i dug a hole and pushed in a twelve-foot white pine, root ball locked in green plastic netting. i did not cut the netting, so twenty years later a tall, beautiful, white pine died. i lynched the roots. to save my life i would let them seize, cut out a bear’s heart, i would partake in its flesh. but you would die before you’d let them kill that bear. again, i say, “nothing for the last time.” you say, “everything for the last time.” sailor, i would have killed a stranger to save the world. sailor, you would not. we kissed goodbye on the cheek. i hope not for the last time.  home, i look into my brass telescope— at the far end, where the moon and distant stars should be, i see my eye looking back at me, it’s twinkling and winking like a star. i go to bed. my dogs, donkeys and wife are sleeping. i am safe. you are home with your wife you met and decided to marry in four days.

 your mind and you are our sargasso sea, london has swept about you this score years and bright ships left you this or that in fee: ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things, strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price. great minds have sought you — lacking someone else. you have been second always. tragical? no. you preferred it to the usual thing: one dull man, dulling and uxorious, one average mind —   with one thought less, each year. oh, you are patient, i have seen you sit hours, where something might have floated up. and now you pay one.   yes, you richly pay. you are a person of some interest, one comes to you and takes strange gain away: trophies fished up; some curious suggestion; fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two, pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else that might prove useful and yet never proves, that never fits a corner or shows use, or finds its hour upon the loom of days: the tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work; idols and ambergris and rare inlays, these are your riches, your great store; and yet for all this sea-hoard of deciduous things, strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff: in the slow float of differing light and deep, no! there is nothing! in the whole and all, nothing that's quite your own. yet this is you.

 we’re talking about when we met and you say  it was easier to fall for me thinking (i’ll remember  this pause) it was likely i’d be dead by now.  talking. falling. thinking. waiting . . . have i  undone what you’ve tried to do? you say no.  you say the surprise of still being is something  being built— the machine of our living, this saltwork of luck,  stylish, safe, comfortable and unintended.  meanwhile, i haven’t had the opportunity to tell you, but  our lovely little dog has just killed a possum.  maybe it’s unfair, a possum entering the argument here.  but i lay it down before us: because an ugly  dying  possum played dead and didn’t run,  its dubious cunning was brought to an end outside our door  by our brutal, beautiful and very pleased little dog.  so how do i say that this is not about death or sadness  or even whether you really first loved me  waiting, thinking i’d be dying young?  it’s just that standing there a few minutes ago  holding a dead possum by its repellent bony tail,  i was struck by how eerily pleased i was to be a spectator  to teeth, spit, agony and claw, feeling full of purpose,  thinking how different in our adversaries we are from possums.  we try love— the fist of words, their opening hand.  and whether we play dead or alive, our pain, the slow  circulation of happiness, our salt and work, the stubborn questions  we endlessly give names to haunt us with choice.

 now that i have cooled to you let there be gold of tarnished masonry, temples soothed by the sun to ruin that sleep utterly. give me hand for the dances, ripples at philae, in and out, and lips, my lesbian, wall flowers that once were flame.  your hair is my carthage and my arms the bow, and our words arrows to shoot the stars who from that misty sea swarm to destroy us.  but you there beside me— oh how shall i defy you, who wound me in the night with breasts shining like venus and like mars? the night that is shouting jason when the loud eaves rattle as with waves above me blue at the prow of my desire.  
NEW POEM
 i want to write a love poem for the girls i kissed in seventh grade, a song for what we did on the floor in the basement  of somebody’s parents’ house, a hymn for what we didn’t say but thought: that feels good or i like that, when we learned how to open each other’s mouths  how to move our tongues to make somebody moan. we called it practicing, and one was the boy, and we paired off—maybe six or eight girls—and turned out  the lights and kissed and kissed until we were stoned on kisses, and lifted our nightgowns or let the straps drop, and, now you be the boy:  concrete floor, sleeping bag or couch, playroom, game room, train room, laundry. linda’s basement was like a boat with booths and portholes  instead of windows. gloria’s father had a bar downstairs with stools that spun, plush carpeting. we kissed each other’s throats.  we sucked each other’s breasts, and we left marks, and never spoke of it upstairs outdoors, in daylight, not once. we did it, and it was  practicing, and slept, sprawled so our legs still locked or crossed, a hand still lost in someone’s hair . . . and we grew up and hardly mentioned who  the first kiss really was—a girl like us, still sticky with moisturizer we’d shared in the bathroom. i want to write a song  for that thick silence in the dark, and the first pure thrill of unreluctant desire, just before we’d made ourselves stop.

 for asja in predawn dark, a rat falling from a rafter is a dollop, wind a whir, and suddenly i'm remembering my mother teaching me to bake her hot water sponge cake.  how we whipped the egg whites with the electric mixer until stiff peaks formed. how she warned me not to allow a single thread of yolk to taint the white, or the cake  would fail. to fold white into yolk-sugar-flour was slow, patient. she let me carve a wedge with the rubber spatula, drop it to the batter's surface, then lift from the bowl's bottom  up and over the dollop, turning it in. warned me never to beat or mix or even stir—the cake would fall. once, dinking around, i stuck a wooden spoon into  the still-whirring beaters, bent the metal, splintered the spoon into the batter. once i cut her grandmother's precious lace for a doll's clothes, and she cried, the savaged pieces  draped across her wrists. so many times i tried to shove my peasant feet into her dainty pumps, hand into her evening gloves. one spoon at a time, that first thin layer drawn across  the airy white forming a little hill. folding only just enough. the batter growing lighter by increments. it was mostly space we folded in, taming down  the cloy. it was never so good as then, licked off the finer, the cake itself, to me, disappointing, layers smeared with homemade jam, topped with a stiff merengue.  never so good as then, her instructing, trying to domesticate my impertinence, teach me a little grace, me resisting, the sweet on my tongue dissolving so easily  in that state of matter. never so good as straight from the pyrex bowl. never so gentle as the slide of batter into an angel food pan. the rest up to her, what she  created from the baked version, brown on top and bottom. here i am, decades later sitting uner the halogen of a full moon, and that moment, which was many  folded into one, is so pure and specific, the sugar sharp on my tongue, the spatula pushing as if through an undertow. my mother taught me to fold. never so  sweet as now. we were incorporating lightness into a deep bowl. as some bird—probably an owl out hunting—chacks its was across the lawn,  sounding like a key chain, and now the garden sprinkler comes on, so i know it's 6:00 a.m. there's the first hint of dawn slow-dissolving one more night. this is a fifty-  year-old love. it's heavy, so i fold in moonlight, the sound of water spattered on leaves. dim stars, bright moon— our lives. the cake imperfect, but finished.  —12.17.2013

 once more the storm is howling, and half hid under this cradle-hood and coverlid my child sleeps on. there is no obstacle but gregory's wood and one bare hill whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind, bred on the atlantic, can be stayed; and for an hour i have walked and prayed because of the great gloom that is in my mind.  i have walked and prayed for this young child an hour, and heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower, and under the arches of the bridge, and scream in the elms above the flooded stream; imagining in excited reverie that the future years had come dancing to a frenzied drum out of the murderous innocence of the sea.  may she be granted beauty, and yet not beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught, or hers before a looking-glass; for such, being made beautiful overmuch, consider beauty a sufficient end, lose natural kindness, and maybe the heart-revealing intimacy that chooses right, and never find a friend.  helen, being chosen, found life flat and dull, and later had much trouble from a fool; while that great queen that rose out of the spray, being fatherless, could have her way, yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man. it's certain that fine women eat a crazy salad with their meat whereby the horn of plenty is undone.  in courtesy i'd have her chiefly learned; hearts are not had as a gift, but hearts are earned by those that are not entirely beautiful. yet many, that have played the fool for beauty's very self, has charm made wise; and many a poor man that has roved, loved and thought himself beloved, from a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.  may she become a flourishing hidden tree, that all her thoughts may like the linnet be, and have no business but dispensing round their magnanimities of sound; nor but in merriment begin a chase, nor but in merriment a quarrel. oh, may she live like some green laurel rooted in one dear perpetual place.  my mind, because the minds that i have loved, the sort of beauty that i have approved, prosper but little, has dried up of late, yet knows that to be choked with hate may well be of all evil chances chief. if there's no hatred in a mind assault and battery of the wind can never tear the linnet from the leaf.  an intellectual hatred is the worst, so let her think opinions are accursed. have i not seen the loveliest woman born out of the mouth of plenty's horn, because of her opinionated mind barter that horn and every good by quiet natures understood for an old bellows full of angry wind?  considering that, all hatred driven hence, the soul recovers radical innocence and learns at last that it is self-delighting, self-appeasing, self-affrighting, and that its own sweet will is heaven's will, she can, though every face should scowl and every windy quarter howl or every bellows burst, be happy still.  and may her bridegroom bring her to a house where all's accustomed, ceremonious; for arrogance and hatred are the wares peddled in the thoroughfares. how but in custom and in ceremony are innocence and beauty born? ceremony's a name for the rich horn, and custom for the spreading laurel tree.

 the light snow started late last night and continued all night long while i slept and could hear it occasionally enter my sleep, where i dreamed my brother was alive again and possessing the beauty of youth, aware that he would be leaving again shortly and that is the lesson of the snow falling and of the seeds of death that are in everything that is born: we are here for a moment of a story that is longer than all of us and few of us remember, the wind is blowing out of someplace we don’t know, and each moment contains rhythms within rhythms, and if you discover some old piece of your own writing, or an old photograph, you may not remember that it was you and even if it was once you, it’s not you now, not this moment that the synapses fire and your hands move to cover your face in a gesture of grief and remembrance.

(they seem to think gay pride’s this weekend’s yawn.) (pit stop at mcd’s, can’t clip pack back on.) who knew she’d march beside me hand-in-hand and who’d expect me to remember names when liz’s girlfriend saw us and waved “hi. it’s . . . anna”? (cnn shot feed, then frames.) booze-stymied by the glare of girls and sky, how could i choose? should i grip hand, or pray wondering: is today today the day she’ll let me turn the key, lead her inside?   2  okay, i’m sober now. today is just the kind of day she talks but feels no lust.   3  beside her isn’t bad. fan-stirred, the air is humid and the theater is packed. an ear-cuffed thespian tries to fix the cold, our leading ladies sweat it out in back. a prim man to my right begins to sneeze. my nose is in agreement. the perfume from queen mother there could clear the room. this shadow play across her face is fine. her arm’s near mine, which means exactly nothing. hope’s hope hums on through separate listening. that skull, opaque to me as midland’s vault, her silky crop, its pepper dabbed with salt — i chuckle at an apt sardonic line. her suede complexion, lifts up, checks the time.   4. les nouvceaux from la nouvelle justine  i don’t love her. she doesn’t love me. neither does this waiter who may think it strange when young girls dine with staid dames twice their age on salade de bastille and pain de sade. i don’t like sitting by her like wet cloth. i don’t like restaurants whose queers pawn sex to the bachelor bunch who want a thrill. i don’t like dining with my, well, not-ex, both measuring the humid air for signs of sparks i see by parts will not ignite. i’d rather have a knock-down, drag-out fight that cleared the joint than watch another guy get spanked by corset kris, who’d like to grab a tit, not spend hip humping hairy thighs. i’d rather i were twice her age and wise. i’d spin cruel stories of past day of bliss then give my own hands covert exercise and send her home to bed without a kiss.   5. l’addition  30 for the play and 10 for gins, 10 for two cabs and 40 for the eats, at least the metro home was freezer-cold, at least the broadway local still had seats at 96th, the local went express. i blistered home ten sockless humid blocks back to my solo digs for solo sex. i got this poem for my 90 bucks.

 of what sins have you made confession here, ardent cecile? not passion’s intimacy, or tangles of desire that mutineer a bold way through your maiden ecstasy. those are not blamed...the penance not severe!  pray rather, with cool-lidded conscious eyes for warm juvescence of those ichored limbs, for laughter checked by no repentant cries, for lips unstained by pattering of hymns. men’s glances have embraced you. they are wise.  they have seen you, cumbent by the ruddy fire, lending your curves to cushioned wantonness, or leaping to the stroke of an earthy lyre twanged in the joy of throbbing noon’s excess and cried no pause for love. you, they require.  of what sins have you made confession here, ardent cecile? the wood receives your knees; the organ stirs your prayer. now you revere the god that made you beautiful among these, the gnarled and ugly. your book receives no tear.

 her body is not so white as anemony petals nor so smooth—nor so remote a thing. it is a field of the wild carrot taking the field by force; the grass does not raise above it. here is no question of whiteness, white as can be, with a purple mole at the center of each flower. each flower is a hand’s span of her whiteness. wherever his hand has lain there is a tiny purple blemish. each part is a blossom under his touch to which the fibres of her being stem one by one, each to its end, until the whole field is a white desire, empty, a single stem, a cluster, flower by flower, a pious wish to whiteness gone over— or nothing.

 kurt, early twenties. met him after an aa meeting in silverlake (november, eighty-five). i remem- ber standing with him up- stairs, in the clubhouse, how i checked his body out. but not who approached whom. or what we talked about before we leaned against my car and kissed, under that tarnished l.a. moon. drove to my place and un- dressed him in the dark. he was smaller than me. i couldn’t keep my hands off his ass. next morning, smoked till he woke, took him back. he thanked me sweetly. i couldn’t have said what i wanted, though must have known. drove home and put him in a poem ("november") i was at the end of.  later that day it rained (i know from the poem).  
NEW POEM
 little has been made of the soft, skirting action of magnets reversed, while much has been made of attraction. but is it not this pillowy principle of repulsion that produces the doily edges of oceans or the arabesques of thought? and do these cutout coasts and incurved rhetorical beaches not baffle the onslaught of the sea or objectionable people and give private life what small protection it's got? praise then the oiled motions of avoidance, the pearly convolutions of all that slides off or takes a wide berth; praise every eddying vacancy of earth, all the dimpled depths of pooling space, the whole swirl set up by fending-off— extending far beyond the personal, i'm convinced— immense and good in a cosmological sense: unpressing us against each other, lending the necessary never to never-ending.  
NEW POEM
 the man sits in a timelessness with the horse under him in time to a movement of legs and hooves upon a timeless sand.  distance comes in from the foreground present in the picture as time he reads outward from and comes from that beginning.  a wind blows in and out and all about the man as the horse ran and runs to come in time.  a house is burning in the sand. a man and horse are burning. the wind is burning. they are running to arrive.

 just as he changes himself, in the end eternity changes him. —mallarmé on the phonograph, the voice of a woman already dead for three decades, singing of a man who could make her do anything. on the table, two fragile glasses of black wine, a bottle wrapped in its towel. it is that room, the one we took in every city, it is as i remember: the bed, a block of moonlight and pillows. my fingernails, pecks of light on your thighs. the stink of the fire escape. the wet butts of cigarettes you crushed one after another. how i watched the morning come as you slept, more my son than a man ten years older. how my breasts feel, years later, the tongues swishing in my dress, some yours, some left by other men. since then, i have always wakened first, i have learned to leave a bed without being seen and have stood at the washbasins, wiping oil and salt from my skin, staring at the cupped water in my two hands. i have kept everything you whispered to me then. i can remember it now as i see you again, how much tenderness we could wedge between a stairwell and a police lock, or as it was, as it still is, in the voice of a woman singing of a man who could make her do anything.  
NEW POEM
 barbed wires on rusted nails can’t hold lone bulls at home when they smell pasture. they thrust their bone skulls under barbs, tongues quivering for a taste of strange  and shove until the post gives way. days later, we find wires sagging, reset the post, and tighten bent wires like a fiddle and rope the worn-out bull,  wishing there was only a fence between us and our heart’s desire. but something with spurs and a rope would find us, cursing and yelling on horseback,  cutting us from escape down arroyos, dragging us frothing and wild-eyed back to the sun-bleached yellow range, the same whirlpool of buzzards.  
NEW POEM
 ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread; for love is dead— all love is dead, infected with plague of deep disdain; worth, as nought worth, rejected, and faith fair scorn doth gain. from so ungrateful fancy, from such a female franzy, from them that use men thus, good lord, deliver us!  weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said that love is dead? his death-bed, peacock's folly; his winding-sheet is shame; his will, false-seeming holy; his sole exec'tor, blame. from so ungrateful fancy, from such a female franzy, from them that use men thus, good lord, deliver us!  let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read, for love is dead; sir wrong his tomb ordaineth my mistress' marble heart, which epitaph containeth, "her eyes were once his dart." from so ungrateful fancy, from such a female franzy, from them that use men thus, good lord, deliver us!  alas, i lie, rage hath this error bred; love is not dead; love is not dead, but sleepeth in her unmatched mind, where she his counsel keepeth, till due desert she find. therefore from so vile fancy, to call such wit a franzy, who love can temper thus, good lord, deliver us!  
NEW POEM
 if you don't know the kind of person i am and i don't know the kind of person you are a pattern that others made may prevail in the world and following the wrong god home we may miss our star.  for there is many a small betrayal in the mind, a shrug that lets the fragile sequence break sending with shouts the horrible errors of childhood storming out to play through the broken dike.  and as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail, but if one wanders the circus won't find the park, i call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.  and so i appeal to a voice, to something shadowy, a remote important region in all who talk: though we could fool each other, we should consider— lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.  for it is important that awake people be awake, or a breaking line may discourage them back to sleep; the signals we give — yes or no, or maybe — should be clear: the darkness around us is deep.  
NEW POEM
 a loon dives in the swollen river. it followed the river first. the town lies between it and canals diverted from the river. the beak of the loon is orange, its wingspan broader than a duck’s.  my father’s legs were swollen. his once thin ankles barely fit his shoes. his heart no longer fed his body. toxins and liquids began to drown him. his silly doctors didn’t see he couldn’t breathe.  my father took me to the river. we fished for bass and bluegill, sunfish, cats. fat suckers, their lips like suction cups, we put back. too many little bones to catch and make you choke.  i no longer want to go fishing. i don’t even want to play in the water. the boat here has no oars, the current is too swift. in the dark, teenagers discover their body together.  the body feels like a prison. i kneel by my father’s stapled body. he suctions thick liquid from his lungs. he coughs to clear them; it hurts. he wants more air. he wants to live, the heart’s valve's parachutes  opening with oxygen to feed the body’s healing. a tube empties the chest cavity. he excretes liquids and poisons. his shocked kidneys come to life. his stunned heart beats. his lung  opens again. he eats. he poops. he walks. he wants to go home. on the phone, i catch my sister taking him home. it’s snowing. it’s cold. my brother and mother help him climb the stairs.  i walk down the path by the shallow canal. i see a falcon fishing. the power plant breathes steam. i hope the wind won’t singe me. i come to the falls  where a little dog barks and bounces hello. his owner smiles and greets me. in the church of saint laurence i kneel, i give thanks, my heart jumps.

 backward, turn backward, o time, in your flight, make me a child again just for tonight! mother, come back from the echoless shore, take me again to your heart as of yore; kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, smooth the few silver threads out of my hair; over my slumbers your loving watch keep;— rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  backward, flow backward, o tide of the years! i am so weary of toil and of tears,— toil without recompense, tears all in vain,— take them, and give me my childhood again! i have grown weary of dust and decay,— weary of flinging my soul-wealth away; weary of sowing for others to reap;— rock me to sleep, mother – rock me to sleep!  tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue, mother, o mother, my heart calls for you! many a summer the grass has grown green, blossomed and faded, our faces between: yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain, long i tonight for your presence again. come from the silence so long and so deep;— rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  over my heart, in the days that are flown, no love like mother-love ever has shone; no other worship abides and endures,— faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours: none like a mother can charm away pain from the sick soul and the world-weary brain. slumber’s soft calms o’er my heavy lids creep;— rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, fall on your shoulders again as of old; let it drop over my forehead tonight, shading my faint eyes away from the light; for with its sunny-edged shadows once more haply will throng the sweet visions of yore; lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;— rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  mother, dear mother, the years have been long since i last listened your lullaby song: sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem womanhood’s years have been only a dream. clasped to your heart in a loving embrace, with your light lashes just sweeping my face, never hereafter to wake or to weep;— rock me to sleep, mother, – rock me to sleep!  
NEW POEM
 johannes brahms and clara schumann the modern biographers worry “how far it went,” their tender friendship. they wonder just what it means when he writes he thinks of her constantly, his guardian angel, beloved friend. the modern biographers ask the rude, irrelevant question of our age, as if the event of two bodies meshing together establishes the degree of love, forgetting how softly eros walked in the nineteenth-century, how a hand held overlong or a gaze anchored in someone’s eyes could unseat a heart, and nuances of address not known in our egalitarian language could make the redolent air tremble and shimmer with the heat of possibility. each time i hear the intermezzi, sad and lavish in their tenderness, i imagine the two of them sitting in a garden among late-blooming roses and dark cascades of leaves, letting the landscape speak for them, leaving us nothing to overhear.  
NEW POEM
 the same to me are sombre days and gay. though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright, because my dearest love is gone away within my heart is melancholy night.  my heart beats low in loneliness, despite that riotous summer holds the earth in sway. in cerements my spirit is bedight; the same to me are sombre days and gay.  though breezes in the rippling grasses play, and waves dash high and far in glorious might, i thrill no longer to the sparkling day, though joyous dawns the rosy morn, and bright.  ungraceful seems to me the swallow's flight; as well might heaven's blue be sullen gray; my soul discerns no beauty in their sight because my dearest love is gone away.  let roses fling afar their crimson spray, and virgin daisies splash the fields with white, let bloom the poppy hotly as it may, within my heart is melancholy night.  and this, oh love, my pitiable plight whenever from my circling arms you stray; this little world of mine has lost its light ... i hope to god, my dear, that you can say the same to me.

 love faded in my heart— i thought it was dead. now new flowers start, fresh leaves outspread. why do these flowers upstart and again the leaves spread? oh, when will it be dead— this root that tears my heart!  
NEW POEM
 the girl’s father laughs a little too hard when i say:she knows what’s important in life as his daughter whips the dime store jump rope over her head for the twelve thousandth time— laughs as if i’m joking, when really, she has it down— sparkly pink handles grimy with effort, her face obscured by her hair, shins thin and bruised, socks down at the ankles. abandoned by the rest of the crowd, the concrete square an archipelago, an alignment with rigor the others cannot fathom, she moves with fierce persistence into afternoon, the heft of the handles, smack of the rope— no double dutch, limbo, no communal game, but this resolute definition of rhythm, slatted bench shadows lengthening into space, the other kids simply forgetting she’s there, her solitary corner of the playground darkening as the dinner hour approaches, while pigeons pause on their branches, squirrels come down the trunk and stop, with rush hour beyond the fence, cars idling, and the rope’s metronome, forgotten as breath, weaving all the disparate energies of girl— elation, fury, eagerness, song— into one singular strand.  
NEW POEM
 to tell you the truth i’d have thought it had gone out of use long ago; there is something so 19th-century about it,  with its absurd reverse puritanism.  can withdrawal from reality or interpersonal commitment be gauged by uneasiness at being summoned to a small closed room to discuss ambiguously sexual material with a total stranger?  alone in the presence of the grave examiner, it soon becomes clear that, short of strangling yourself, you are going to have to find a way of suppressing the snickers of an eight-year-old sex fiend, and feign cu- riosity about the process to mask your indignation at being placed in this situation.  sure, you see lots of pretty butterflies with the faces of ancient egypt- ian queens, and so forth—you see other things, too.  flying stingray vaginas all over the place, along with a few of their male counterparts transparently camouflaged as who knows what pil- lars and swords out of the old brain’s unconscious.  you keep finding yourself thinking, “god damn it, don’t tell me that isn’t a pussy!”  but after long silence come out with, “oh, this must be christ trying to prevent a large crowd from stoning a woman to death.”  the thing to do is keep a straight face, which is hard. after all, you’re supposed to be crazy  (and are probably proving it).  maybe a nudge and a chuckle or two wouldn’t hurt your case. yes,  it’s some little card game you’ve gotten yourself into this time, when your only chance is to lose. fold,  and they have got you by the balls—  just like the ones you neglected to identify.  
NEW POEM
 wherein she martyrs the mirror: this carnival of stone, her lips dilate the negation—space into starpoint  wherein she, to be both sacrum &amp; wrist— neither the fugitive epidermis, nor the unlocked ashblack— sovereigns the shadow swell as love  wherein she ardors the emptiness open, proof the unanchored spirit of my silence, her revisions clothing my brightest orgasm—  wherein she says, i can hear you, the seed under the belly’s flesh—love the far shore, she says, for she withdraws the spring wild  thrust in her mother’s surrender, iron ocean blackened to aurora.

 well, this is nothing new, nothing to rattle the rafters in the noggin,  this moment of remembering and its kissing cousin the waking dream.  i wonder if i'll remember it? i've had a vision of a woman  reclining underneath a tree: she's about half naked and little by little  i'm sprinkling her burial mounds with grass. this is the kind of work  i like. it lets me remember, and so i do. i remember the time i laid  my homemade banjo in the fire and let it burn. there was nothing else  to burn and the house was cold; the cigar box curled inside the flames.  but the burst of heat was over soon, and once the little roar was done,  i could hear the raindrops plopping up the buckets and kettles, scattered out  like little ponds around the room. it was night and i was a boy, alone  and left to listen to that old music. i liked it. i've liked it ever since.  i loved the helpless people i loved. that's what a little boy will do,  but a grown man will turn it all to sadness and let it soak his heart  until he wrings it out and dreams about another kind of love,  some afternoon beneath a tree. burial mounds—that's hilarious.  
NEW POEM
 angered, may i be near a glass of water; may my first impulse be to think of silence, its deities (who are they? do, in fact, they exist? etc.).  may i recall what aristotle says of the subject: to give vent to rage is not to release it but to be increasingly prone to its incursions.  may i imagine being in the inferno,  hearing it asked: “virgilio mio, who’s that sulking with achilles there?” and hearing virgil say: “dante,  that fellow, at the slightest provocation, slammed phone receivers down, and waved his arms like a madman. what attila did to europe, what genghis khan did  to asia, that poor dope did to his marriage.” may i, that is, put learning to good purpose, mindful that melancholy is a sin, though stylish at present.  better than rage is the post-dinner quiet, the sink’s warm turbulence, the streaming platters, the suds rehearsing down the drain in spirals in the last rinsing.  for what is, after all, the good life save that conducted thoughtfully, and what is passion if not the holiest of powers, sustaining only if mastered.

 i am locked in a little cedar box with a picture of shepherds pasted onto the central panel between carvings. the box stands on curved legs. it has a gold, heart-shaped lock and no key. i am trying to write my way out of the closed box redolent of cedar. satan comes to me in the locked box and says,i’ll get you out. say my father is a shit. i say my father is a shit and satan laughs and says,it’s opening. say your mother is a pimp. my mother is a pimp. something opens and breaks when i say that. my spine uncurls in the cedar box like the pink back of the ballerina pin with a ruby eye, resting beside me on satin in the cedar box. say shit, say death, say fuck the father, satan says, down my ear. the pain of the locked past buzzes in the child’s box on her bureau, under the terrible round pond eye etched around with roses, where self-loathing gazed at sorrow. shit. death. fuck the father. something opens. satan says don’t you feel a lot better? light seems to break on the delicate edelweiss pin, carved in two colors of wood. i love him too, you know, i say to satan dark in the locked box. i love them but i’m trying to say what happened to us in the lost past.of course, he says and smiles,of course. now say: torture. i see, through blackness soaked in cedar, the edge of a large hinge open. say: the father’s cock, the mother’s cunt, says satan,i’ll get you out. the angle of the hinge widens until i see the outlines of the time before i was, when they were locked in the bed. when i say the magic words, cock, cunt, satan softly says,come out. but the air around the opening is heavy and thick as hot smoke. come in, he says, and i feel his voice breathing from the opening. the exit is through satan’s mouth. come in my mouth, he says,you’re there already, and the huge hinge begins to close. oh no, i loved them, too, i brace my body tight in the cedar house. satan sucks himself out the keyhole. i’m left locked in the box, he seals the heart-shaped lock with the wax of his tongue. it’s your coffin now, satan says. i hardly hear; i am warming my cold hands at the dancer’s ruby eye— the fire, the suddenly discovered knowledge of love.

 green and brown current of river: reverberant iron bridge: crossing over, woman and child fixed at the center, holding hands and both weeping:  because her child is weeping: because his mother weeps: because the river, far underfoot, glitters through cracks in the wooden flooring that widen  perceptively as he steps. ahead, heightened by a hill, dwarfed in yellow trees, the house is made ready. all should have been primer-perfect,  including the train rushing headlong past the station, always in arrears, never deigning to stop and put down a stepping-stool. nothing more is given:  except perhaps an assignment of cause: a plank has fallen away to the river. the two figures clasp hands across the gulf, rocking back and forth in soundless  oscillation there on the bridge where my mind proposes to leave them in place, my mother and me, on the first day of school, 1921.

 natchez afternoon burns everything off franklin street. even the birds, even the flies.  or iced-tea sugar and chicken grease weigh everyone into a doze, all indoors, in a cool  they said would never come eighty years ago when this was still the center of business  and the civilized left these high hours to the dogs, ice in a highball, and let each house  close its lids a while. they've kept their quiet, so i'm alone before the windows,  the radiant panes, each with its scrim of clay, the finish the river gives everything,  so nothing, not even glass, is clear. it's almost painful, this saturation,  this street and its stores of rugs and signs and flags, bright and strange as a magazine photo  you'd find in an attic or an antique store, hard to believe the color was ever real.  the teacups, the painted china and jeweled eggs, even the bottles, medicine vials  and flasks each with its ounce of dirt, even the smell of the prolific earth,  the sedimentary atmosphere of empire chairs and oak armoires and mantles that survive  their tall, white homes, like the plantation house where, later, i'll witness again  the marriage of gray suit and hoop skirt that still feels like a dream, where i'll walk  out of—or is it into?—myself, the maitre'd's small, solicitous voice  proffering another julep—cotton-leaf hand, silver cup—though even he must be  a reenactment or a revenant, a hanger for the clothes of memory.  i will take it, i would, a handful of refuge in unthinking weather, will take  the same lethargic joy in a breeze, any chill in the throat, any kind of shade—  so i enter the dim of one old cotton house, its air-conditioned maze of hand-tools  and quilts, corn cribs and cotton gins, and of course the owner's smile, porcelain, bright, almost  blinding, blooming in welcome and how-you-do and what-brings-you. we talk amid rows  of cook-stoves, stew-pots, and cast-iron skillets about the wedding i've come to see  on the famed estate, the time the town exploded, the rhythm club's inferno, and then  she ventures she knows the accent, knows i'm from alabama, and soon she's eloquent  on our lakes and rivers, where the mister takes her every chance they get. she's seen it all,  so she asks where i'm from, and when i say she starts to glow, gushing over mountains  all the way to gatlinburg. she's walked each one, even skied the state's one slope, which conjures  not the "southern snow" that required almost everything around us, but snow, cold snow, a thought  that cools me further, so my sweat is nearly dry when the smile tightens across her teeth  and she leans in to say ijust love it you know—there are no darkies there.  then afternoon is a conspiracy of color, an echo the heat or the history  in our voices draws us into— someone else's version of ourselves—  and the inevitable, painful quiet in which an answer must arrive.  what can you say? and how long do you have to wait before you can leave, before you can walk  out of yourself and down the cotton-trading streets into the smother of trees  on some more recent lane? how long do you have to wait before you can leave and not be followed,  and how long do you have to walk before the mockingbirds drown in bass and drum and anger,  before you can cross back into the proper century? the smell of the river stays with you,  maybe even grows as you move so you don't know where you're going, and the key in your hand  could open a car door or a plantation room or nothing at all, some door that's vanished  in the air, june's shimmer from the asphalt and the roofs of every house, so you walk  toward that moment when the sun starts burning and the magnolias' thick perfume washes  all around and you find yourself on a corner, all linen and sweat, again the only one  who'd walk in a heat like this. you have no idea where you are, so you cock your head  as if you might hear your way through the afternoon, and when you raise your head, you see,  across the street, two men hunched in shadow on a barbershop's stoop, ties  dangling like smoke in the solid air. they've seen you and now their brows sharpen  as if they know, too, you're not from here, and in the space between you anything  could pass, the ghosts of farragut or grant or a hot white caddy rattling new orleans bounce,  you're waiting to see, it seems like years or centuries, then one rises, ties his tie, and steps back in,  leaving the other, who keeps your eye a moment longer then looks into the distance  through that lace of smoke that seems etched in the air for something far behind you, something  you don't even know how to look for, something that may never arrive.  
NEW POEM
 when the trains come into strange cities the citizens come out to meet the strangers. i love you, jack, he said i love you, jack, he said at another station. when passengers come in from strange cities the citizens come out to help the strangers. i love you too, i said i love you too, i said from another station. the citizens are kind to passing strangers and nourish them and kiss their lips in kindness. i walk the unbelieving streets i walk the unbelieving streets in a strange city. at night in cold new beds the welcomed strangers achieve in memory the city's promise. i wake in love with you i wake in love with you at last year's station. then say goodbye to citizens and city admit this much—that they were kind to strangers. i leave my love with you i leave my love with you in this strange city.  
NEW POEM
 it sat between my husband and my children. a place was set for it—a plate of greens. it had been there: i had seen it but not somehow—but this was like a dream— not seen it so that i knew i saw it. it was as if i could not know i saw it because i had never once in all my life not seen it. it was an eland. an eland!that is why the children would ask my husband, for a joke, at christmas: “father, is it donner?” he would say, “no, blitzen.” it had been there always. now we put silver at its place at meals, fed it the same food we ourselves ate, and said nothing. many times when it breathed heavily (when it had tried a long useless time to speak) and reached to me so that i touched it—of a different size and order of being, like the live hard side of a horse’s neck when you pat the horse— and looked with its great melting tearless eyes fringed with a few coarse wire-like lashes into my eyes, and whispered to me so that my eyes turned backward in their sockets and they said nothing— many times i have known, when they said nothing, that it did not exist. if they had heard they could not have been silent. and yet they heard; heard many times what i have spoken when it could no longer speak, but only breathe— when i could no longer speak, but only breathe.  and, after some years, the others came and took it from me—it was ill, they told me— and cured it, they wrote me: my whole city sent me cards lilac-branches, mourning as i had mourned— and i was standing by a grave in flowers, by dyed rolls of turf, and a canvas marquee the last brown of earth.  it is over. it is over so long that i begin to think that it did not exist, that i have never— and my son says, one morning, from the paper: “an eland. look, an eland!” —it was so.  today, in a german dictionary, i saw elend and the heart in my breast turned over, it was—  it was a word one translates wretched.  it is as if someone remembered saying: “this is an antimacassar that i grew from seed,” and this were true. and, truly, one could not wish for anything more strange— for anything more. and yet it wasn’t interesting.  .  . —it was worse than impossible, it was a joke.  and yet when it was, i was— even to think that i once thought that i could see it to feel the sweat like needles at my hair-roots, i am blind  —it was not even a joke, not even a joke. yet how can i believe it? or believe that i owned it, a husband, children? is my voice the voice of that skin of being—of what owns, is owned in honor or dishonor, that is borne and bears— or of that raw thing, the being inside it that has neither a wife, a husband, nor a child but goes at last as naked from this world as it was born into it—  and the eland comes and grazes on its grave.  this is senseless? shall i make sense or shall i tell the truth? choose either—i cannot do both.  i tell myself that. and yet it is not so, and what i say afterwards will not be so: to be at all is to be wrong. being is being old and saying, almost comfortably, across a table from— from what i don’t know— in a voice rich with a kind of longing satisfaction: “to own an eland! that’s what i call life!”

 this was the winter mother told time by my heart ticking like a frayed fan belt in my chest. this was the fifties &amp; we were living on nothing &amp; what of her, the black girl, my own black nurse, what of her who arrived on greyhound in the heart of so dramatic a storm it froze the sleeves at her wrists &amp; each nostril was rimed with white like salt on a glass, what of her who came up the dark stair on the limp of her own bad ticker, weary, arrogant, thin, her suitcase noosed with rope, in the grip of a rage she came, a black woman, into our white lives, like a splinter, &amp; stayed. charming &amp; brilliantly condescending, she leaned down to kiss “the baby,” &amp; hissed my little princess&amp; hushed the jordan &amp; set the chariots on the golden streets &amp;mother, i cried to her, &amp; went out like a light.

 i know i promised to stop talking about her, but i was talking to myself. the truth is, she’s a child who stopped growing, so i’ve always allowed her to tag along, and when she brings her melancholy close to me i comfort her. naturally you’re curious; you want to know how she became a gnarled branch veiled in diminutive blooms. but i’ve told you all i know. i was sure she had secrets, but she had no secrets. i had to tell her mine.

 i stood inside myself like a dead tree or a tower. i pulled the rope of braided hair and high above me a bell of leaves tolled.  because my hand stabbed its brother, i said: make it stone.  because my tongue spoke harshly, i said: make it dust. and yet it was not death, but her body in its green dress i longed for. that’s why i stood for days in the field until the grass turned black and the rain came.

 dazzling emptiness of the black green end of summer no one running in the yard pulse pulse the absence.  leave them not to the empty yards.  they resembled a family. long quiet hours. sometimes one was angry sometimes someone called her "wife" someone's hair receding.  an uptick in the hormone canopy embodied a restlessness and oh what to do with it.  (how she arrived in a hush in a looking away and not looking.)  it had been some time since richness intangible and then they made a whole coat of it.  meanwhile august moved toward its impervious finale. a mood by the river. gone. one lucid rush carrying them along.  borderless and open the days go on—

 i’ve been sad and can’t find a seasonal sequence. i go forward then my order reverses and it’s winter again two years ago, with that sticky ice that lost your footing as you gripped that container of greek yogurt you brought to the doctor’s, even when you couldn’t speak; you only darted your eyes with a fear that continually registered in your pupil size. you clutched your sets of things. i am full of what are sets of things i know well then i go backwards and i don’t have any sets of things. i see your pink-stained washcloth from your wool coat. your cerebellum tumor is inside with your other tumors but i don’t know it’s there yet neither do you. it appeared and controlled your brain and the things you couldn’t hold. i wonder what things really are, if they are just a set of symbols we sequence and then find purposeful. i wonder if they are like rituals that we learn for our brain. we have those for our body and those for our brain. i look at you — you are alive — and you breathe labored breaths then you died. there, in the hospital bed, when i let time lapse not knowing how to hold you. i let you die for seven days. your daughter, bigger than i am, could hold you. she could use her muscles to grip you, but i couldn’t hold you, even though you lost forty pounds your last month. i couldn’t find the sequence because i reversed everything into its pain cycle and you didn’t want me to watch you die but i couldn’t understand how everyone could let it happen and i could too, but only if i could let it fall into its hole, its awkward sequence, around death; it’s not awkward it’s just not right. i could make as many intuitive decisions, and many logical sequences occurred around your treatments, but i didn’t know you were stepping out of sequence, and treatments are not producing remedies, and i left myself at the side of the hospital bed. you were in another light, exiting slowly. i thought the sequence of grieving would banish all the anxiety but it came back this year. i became debilitated. i have a debilitating anxiety that i thought was gone.  i have too many anxious sequences now and they are blurring meaning. they are blurring my truths like time-lapses and i don’t rush to find the joy of the occurrence without looking for the traps, and my logic, and my stumbling out into another bed that places me in this now-future and you don’t see me because you are no longer alive with me and i can’t rectify this sequence. and i worry that when i love him he will die too. i can’t happen into its learning like it’s wisdom. it’s still deeply unconscious to hold this fear after i banished worry because i looked it in the eyes and it was real and i felt i knew what it looked like. it’s the unknowing learning that i was deeply afraid to imagine and yet it’s your empty bed, your empty closet, you’re empty of the spirited you that gave you to me, in that human way we come to rely upon and that shames us so. and every night of this thinking is a long night of this thinking. do you fall into bed with us, and i have no idea of this? i’d love to think it’s so, and we have room for your sets of things.

 since you were not hume’s sunrise i watch the late-may moonrise alone  and a nicotine trance assures me that summer is coming, and the arrival  of painted toenails; that at last i truly understand aubades  and james stewart’s vacant hospital gaze after his wits have vanished with his love;  that the transmigration of bruises from skin to spirit brings about  such splendid depths of character you’ll drop a dime and never hear a sound.  clouds race across the moon’s pale face. i have character to spare, it is  no comfort; i will write us down, making nothing happen, it won’t repair  this ache of failed induction, these eye that live for sunlight, though the sky stays dark.

 plum black &amp; the blush white of an apple shoulder, melon &amp; cream, in tones to list the flesh; in light, washed colors off at last &amp; textures sheer with damp i slowly pull from you with your quick help. weekend's ample procrastinations to forget the least of what we want to do. april, half a blast of cold, half new light, green &amp; simple. now dusk. now fear. we pencil what we owe on this short form, our numbers good enough. the goose-neck glare undoes how we spent the day. each bite each bee-sting kiss each bitten o all aftertaste. later, at the drop-off, postmark queue, we joke: "now we can die!"

 a girl who, in 1971, when i was living by myself, painfully lonely, bereft, depressed, offhandedly mentioned to me in a conversation with some friends that although at first she’d found me— i can’t remember the term, some dated colloquialism signifying odd, unacceptable, out-of-things— she’d decided that i was after all all right ... twelve years later she comes back to me from nowhere and i realize that it wasn’t my then irrepressible, unselective, incessant sexual want she meant, which, when we’d been introduced, i’d naturally aimed at her and which she’d easily deflected, but that she’d thought i really was, in myself, the way i looked and spoke and acted, what she was saying, creepy, weird, whatever, and i am taken with a terrible humiliation.

 she dwelt among the untrodden ways beside the springs of dove, a maid whom there were none to praise and very few to love:  a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye! —fair as a star, when only one is shining in the sky.  she lived unknown, and few could know when lucy ceased to be; but she is in her grave, and, oh, the difference to me!

 the first four leaders had broken knees the four old dams had broken knees the flock would start to run, then freeze the first four leaders had broken knees  ‘why is the flock so docile?’ asked the hawk. ‘yes, why is the flock so docile,’ laughed the dog,  ‘the shepherd’s mallet is in his hand, the shepherd’s hand is on the land, the flock will start to run, then freeze— the four old dams have broken knees,’ the dog explained.  the hawk exclaimed: ‘the shepherd leads an easy life!’  ‘i know, i know,’ cried the shepherd’s wife, ‘he dresses me out in a narrow skirt and leaves me home to clean his dirt. whenever i try to run, i freeze— all the old dams have broken knees.’  ‘well, i’m so glad he doesn’t dare to bring his breaking power to bear on me,’ said the hawk, flying into the sun; while the dog warned, in his dog run: ‘hawk—the shepherd has bought a gun!’  ‘why is the hawk so docile?’ asked the flock,  ‘he fell to the ground in a feathery breeze; he lies in a dumb lump under the trees, we believe we’d rather have broken knees than lose our blood and suddenly freeze like him.’  but the oldest dam gave her leg a lick, and said, ‘some die slow and some die quick, a few run away and the rest crawl, but the shepherd never dies at all— damn his soul.  i’d will my wool to the shepherd’s wife if she could change the shepherd’s life, but i myself would bring him low if only,only i knew how.’

 all the old photographs, hidden like buried treasure. broken prayer sticks under my dreams  and my worn mattress. each one like a postcard sent back home; wonders only seen in slick travel magazines.  boxed up under my bed, colored souls on kodak paper— i can still see grandma’s smile next to her resting sheep dog.  like a blue lightning strike over the northern sky, over two black houses, i pull the first leaf out, at random.  a picture-flash: tom and susie worker are sitting together on a couch covered with a large navajo chief’s blanket woven  by her brown hands and sheep’s wool. the pattern of stripes— blue to black to white, shifting like rain clouds to clear skies.  my grandparents look tired. the day was christmas 1992, with a little bit of snow on the earth. tired from traveling  over 100 miles away from their painted desert to the city, tired from raising eleven children of the deer  spring before the depression, before roosevelt, before the world wars, before computers, before  satellite phones and televisions . . . . outside, the north wind was blowing tuba city away. but, grandma’s and grandpa’s  eyes are glazed red from happiness. outside, the clouds swelled full of snow and ice.  a blue lightning flash, another photograph, another place: new york, 1985: i see the statue of liberty, tiny, like a pin  stuck in the gray ocean, surrounded by the wrought metal edges of gotham city. it was the only picture i took:  the dollar-bill green lady holding her torch, guiding moths, reality, men and ferries. as she stood in iconic  pose, grandma flooded back, quickly: strong in her own green velvet dress, she stretched dough over her palms, making frybread.  a foghorn wailed just past the emerald city’s fiery torch. my mind refocused on the warm glow of a new moon.  the lady’s light filled the starless sky like grandma’s teardrop turquoise and silver brooch. made from a thousand tiny kingman  nuggets, its shine captured in a perfect burst— a sunflower high on a green stem. each seed a raindrop  made of smooth sky. when the sun touched the brooch, it was blinding. a perfect mosaic of water-light-sky stones.  a blue strike—bright from a cigarette—steals lady liberty’s light. the staten island ferry moves on to crow agency, montana.  at custer battlefield, my cousins smile for a picture, tourists next to custer’s grave. defiant, wearing dark shades,  they hold up cans of coors light waiting for custer to rise again so they can take up their bows, arrows, uzis. warriors,  proud and ready to hide deep in the yellowtail prairie grass. their women and children safe in tipi camps by the little  bighorn river. i know they would die again and again. rise again and again to put up more white marble tombstones.  they would do this to save our future children, to save our grandmas—mary black eagle, susie worker, great great great  grandmother lefthand . . . . they would save our grandfathers too— sonny black eagle, tom worker, the horned toad . . . .  lodge grass indians, the high school basketball team, plays a few miles from mary’s block house and her ten grazing horses.  her basketball team is waiting for the final winning basket to end time, an orange ball to shoot dead the visiting team  from billings. another war of savages versus whites. won this time by the “skins”—class “b” state champs again.  two leggings, a ’49, a warrior’s party. the tranquil dark raven feathers, a deep cold night fueled by a bonfire and beer.  victory runs hot, steaming piss into the trout-filled river lined by a hundred cars, nights caws, and some more tame  drinking brawls. all night long, the happy indian basketball warriors sing ’49 songs:we won, but my dark-hair girlfriend  left with one of the blue-eyed. he na ya na  
NEW POEM
 essentially, for some time, in an effort to determine whether i loved you or not, i've been praying to you, even though the inside of the tabernacle, as i thought, is empty: oxygen, carbon dioxide, brass, nickel, and a sheet, a sheet of gilded plywood. (and in the rectory, the housekeeper is cooking pasta, stamped in the shape of shells, all of a uniform size and color.) in an effort to determine, in an effort to determine whether i loved you, whether i loved you or not, i learned old lovers are christs or bodhisattvas. slowly at first, and then with greater skill, in an effort to determine whether i loved you, i loved you or not, i've been praying without knowing it, in the daylight, in the white afternoon, and singing, and singing with records, my head tilted up into the black walnut, the windows alive with listening ravens to whom i sing about your boxy feet with rind of callus at the heel, (as elsewhere noted), your smiting eyes, your nose pugged slightly, like socrates, your dark skin, your dark. your voice like a woodwind, a basset clarinet; the wind you went out on, the wind you came in on, your hair the color of a violin, the unambiguous quality of many of your pronouncements, i.e., the time you said i was tortured by life, your eyes boring through me, right for the wrong reasons, again. the time in new orleans you were so angry, i was so drunk, lurching in the curio shops full of shells. a shell grows around itself, folding over the first pattern, calcified into a whorled shape, not dissimilar to the whorl on the top of our two heads, the pattern of gorgeous irreplaceable error, and for a while the only assurance we belonged, we belonged to the same species. and the joy was piercing, this piercing joy came up in me, a whirring train, night, on the way home, somewhere before memphis. the singing in my ears. a hurricane, a hurricane outside to my right was photographed from a satellite even as a criminal was being printed, his thumb whorl down, twisted clockwise, and the trees out in the dark strained, growing, forming knots, their flesh burled in the timedrift. i've wondered: does the twisting hurt them, and did all your turnings and hidings wound you as they did me, and did you notice my imprint, my concealment in that fold of air beside you, when into your boxy feet and brown hands nails, nails were driven, when you got into that car and went west, when you sat under that tree almost forever?  
NEW POEM
 exploring the farm as a child i would part the tall grasses, moving through the dirt beneath the thick rushes. consisting mainly of overgrown clover and clusters of foliage, i’d map the distance that made up our property. it seemed endless, that innocent drive to run further beneath the ceiling of leaves, expanses of earth shifting beneath a child’s slight weight. i would imagine how far the landscape stretched.  one afternoon when my parents were at the races i followed the pasture floor to the fenceline at the back of the property. wanting to go further, i hovered a blade of grass over the ticking wire as i had watched dad do so many times, to test if it was safe to cross. feeling nothing, i wrapped my hands around one of the copper threads — struck by that first surge through the body, electricity running like a vein of blood beneath the skin as though a voice screamed through a haze, blinding my eyes and rattling my mind with panic.  no longer wishing to know more, to understand, i stood startled at the trapped earth and wires that had run a painful electric current through my body. it would have been foolish to even attempt climbing over into the neighboring paddock. all i could do then was give up.  
NEW POEM
 some people might describe this room as spare: a bedside table and an ashtray and an antique  chair; a mattress and a coffee mug; an unwashed cotton blanket and a rug  my mother used to own. i used to have a phone. i used to have another  room, a bigger broom, a wetter sponge. i used to water my bouquet  of paper clips and empty pens, of things i thought i’d want to say if given chance;  but now, to live, to sit somehow, to watch a particle of thought dote on the dust  and dwindle in a little grid of shadow on the sunset’s patchy rust seems like enough.

 here comes the shadow not looking where it is going, and the whole night will fall; it is time. here comes the little wind which the hour drags with it everywhere like an empty wagon through leaves. here comes my ignorance shuffling after them asking them what they are doing.  standing still, i can hear my footsteps come up behind me and go on ahead of me and come up behind me and with different keys clinking in the pockets, and still i do not move. here comes the white-haired thistle seed stumbling past through the branches like a paper lantern carried by a blind man. i believe it is the lost wisdom of my grandfather whose ways were his own and who died before i could ask.  forerunner, i would like to say, silent pilot, little dry death, future, your indirections are as strange to me as my own. i know so little that anything you might tell me would be a revelation.  sir, i would like to say, it is hard to think of the good woman presenting you with children, like cakes, granting you the eye of her needle, standing in doorways, flinging after you little endearments, like rocks, or her silence like a whole sunday of bells. instead, tell me: which of my many incomprehensions did you bequeath me, and where did they take you? standing in the shoes of indecision, i hear them come up behind me and go on ahead of me wearing boots, on crutches, barefoot, they could never get together on any door-sill or destination— the one with the assortment of smiles, the one jailed in himself like a forest, the one who comes back at evening drunk with despair and turns into the wrong night as though he owned it—oh small deaf disappearance in the dusk, in which of their shoes will i find myself tomorrow?

 1 desert heat, high clouds, and sky the color of lapis. on this journey, anything seems possible, so we stop by an ancient cottonwood to kiss. the beauty trembles, doesn't say a word, just watches me, so open. small birds fly by, flock in the shady tree above us. what settles in her heart? what congeals? hope? despair? far off, the river churns in its sandy banks, swallows veer, turn in fiery air. will these kisses seal her to me? i her lover, she my wife? is all of this a dream, my whole life?  2 she is just this side of wonderful, and suddenly the glamorous world fills itself with shining and we laugh at highway monuments that explain how hard the trek had been for franciscans in the indian wilderness, poor fellows— conversion is the devil's own work! then the stones of her dream turn up under her feet, the back of a huge land turtle. i know we must be circling paradise because the ants enter the fleshy petals of the roadside flowers with evident joy and purpose (oh, my dark, pretty one).  3 music, my adored. when is there never music? my accordion puffs up with drinkable melodies. i spill her tunes into your listening ear, one after the other: the squeeze-box enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy with its hard rhythms, lilts the back- breaking labor song the worker croons to earth, warbles romantic notes of dissolving borders. you melt like a woman beneath her lover's touch. music is happy and pitiless when it sets fire to combustible souls. even the raspy bandoneon's voice is lyric.  4 sacred. sacred. sacred. sacred. (speak in a whisper.) we slip into this space half cognizant. the land is very large indeed: bones of the earth worn down, though she is a living thing. see how she exposes her grace? antelopes graze on the far plain—their high, white tails—the red soil throbs its slow heartbeat, and the blue sky clears so smartly, perfectly, like radiance. are the ancestors near? what can we know? we decide to wander around this prairie, mistaken for utes, buy commodities in little towns.  5 late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked malheur after the long curve of the snake river plain. (above the falls where the shoshone went to pray we soaked our feet in cold water, and i observed the arch of her brown foot.) rabbitbrush and sage along the highway, juniper on far hills and bluffs. sundown, and dusk falls over the wide basin of land. in burns we eat eggs in a cafe, take a room in the motel 6. in the dark, i can see her black hair, black against the pillows. its clean scent makes me think of corn. at dawn, i hold her and there are kisses. then more kisses. then more. the day is cold; a north wind blew last night. but the land is open. rain falls in showers of light.  6 her hand on my thigh, my shoulder, in my hair. she leans over to kiss my cheek. we look at each other, smile. for miles we travel this way, nearly silent, point with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king- fisher on the snag above the swollen creek. one night i weep in her arms as she cries,"oh, oh, oh!" because i have touched her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts. in that communion of lovers, thick sobs break from me as i think of my love back home, all that i have done and cannot say. this is the first time i have left her so completely, so alone.

 tip their mouths open to the sky. turquoise, amber, the deep green with fluted handle, pitcher the size of two thumbs, tiny lip and graceful waist.  here we place the smallest flower which could have lived invisibly in loose soil beside the road, sprig of succulent rosemary, bowing mint.  they grow deeper in the center of the table.  here we entrust the small life, thread, fragment, breath. and it bends. it waits all day. as the bread cools and the children open their gray copybooks to shape the letter that looks like a chimney rising out of a house.  and what do the headlines say?  nothing of the smaller petal perfectly arranged inside the larger petal or the way tinted glass filters light. men and boys, praying when they died, fall out of their skins. the whole alphabet of living, heads and tails of words, sentences, the way they said, “ya’allah!” when astonished, or “ya’ani” for “i mean”— a crushed glass under the feet still shines. but the child of hebron sleeps with the thud of her brothers falling and the long sorrow of the color red.

 1  this one’s on route 80 south of water’s end, arizona, speeding anywhere else when i’m tired of reading the yellow dash-and-dash, highway’s old adage. sunglasses coaxed yellows to reds, though there are none where i look into the camera. behind me, a blur of roadside cactus called “succulents,” for the moisture they save for years. the sky cut from indigo to blue to white until i wished for the sunset’s truncations to stay there, thinking, too, that the verge of its curve could flirt me into the absolute.   2  moving on, in bangkok, i’m always crouching in these, wanting to keep my head lower than his to show i know he’s mother’s father.  asked, on going in, not to say anything if he brought up the distant old dealings, metallic shrillings of long-dead women, asked to ignore what they’d do for him, offerings he could almost eat a meal on.  and this from the aunt who was asked to leave the family when she was young, “for the sake of the children,” drawing the bad lot. no one told me why.  that’s my foot in the foreground. that was the daylight’s assignment of unwavering white, the background.  these are only the circumstances. as for an end to the glare getting the last word in, there was none.   3  he’d set the machine on the tripod himself, return to read the newspaper, wait for the click, and want to keep it, the stop-time, that is, the pretending to read the newspaper. held half in the shadow fans of the palm tree, half in a browbeat of sun. so that the machine had to catch him quickly, the clarity, the shot of his legs as  suddenly: brown leather sheaves holding bone.   4  say the moment arrives at the frame, and she who is about to enter the picture approaches. at the end of the road trip, she turns back in the hopes of memorizing what’s been passed, the colors that changed, the mirror-winks, the real moisture, invisible, along side mirage.  his face was a once-darker shade of dust in his country. some days he’d set the aperture, the opening, as wide as he could, to ruin the picture, to let all the light in.  
NEW POEM
 to the memory of the household it describes this poem is dedicated by the author  “as the spirits of darkness be stronger in the dark, so good spirits, which be angels of light, are augmented not only by the divine light of the sun, but also by our common wood fire: and as the celestial fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our fire of wood doth the same.” —cor. agrippa, occult philosophy, book i.ch. v.  “announced by all the trumpets of the sky, arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields, seems nowhere to alight: the whited air hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven, and veils the farm-house at the garden’s end. the sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace, enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm.” emerson, the snow storm. the sun that brief december day rose cheerless over hills of gray, and, darkly circled, gave at noon a sadder light than waning moon. slow tracing down the thickening sky its mute and ominous prophecy, a portent seeming less than threat, it sank from sight before it set. a chill no coat, however stout, of homespun stuff could quite shut out, a hard, dull bitterness of cold, that checked, mid-vein, the circling race of life-blood in the sharpened face, the coming of the snow-storm told. the wind blew east; we heard the roar of ocean on his wintry shore, and felt the strong pulse throbbing there beat with low rhythm our inland air.  meanwhile we did our nightly chores,— brought in the wood from out of doors, littered the stalls, and from the mows raked down the herd’s-grass for the cows; heard the horse whinnying for his corn; and, sharply clashing horn on horn, impatient down the stanchion rows the cattle shake their walnut bows; while, peering from his early perch upon the scaffold’s pole of birch, the cock his crested helmet bent and down his querulous challenge sent.  unwarmed by any sunset light the gray day darkened into night, a night made hoary with the swarm and whirl-dance of the blinding storm, as zigzag, wavering to and fro, crossed and recrossed the wingëd snow: and ere the early bedtime came the white drift piled the window-frame, and through the glass the clothes-line posts looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts.  so all night long the storm roared on: the morning broke without a sun; in tiny spherule traced with lines of nature’s geometric signs, in starry flake, and pellicle, all day the hoary meteor fell; and, when the second morning shone, we looked upon a world unknown, on nothing we could call our own. around the glistening wonder bent the blue walls of the firmament, no cloud above, no earth below,— a universe of sky and snow! the old familiar sights of ours took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers rose up where sty or corn-crib stood, or garden-wall, or belt of wood; a smooth white mound the brush-pile showed, a fenceless drift what once was road; the bridle-post an old man sat with loose-flung coat and high cocked hat; the well-curb had a chinese roof; and even the long sweep, high aloof, in its slant splendor, seemed to tell of pisa’s leaning miracle.  a prompt, decisive man, no breath our father wasted: “boys, a path!” well pleased, (for when did farmer boy count such a summons less than joy?) our buskins on our feet we drew; with mittened hands, and caps drawn low, to guard our necks and ears from snow, we cut the solid whiteness through. and, where the drift was deepest, made a tunnel walled and overlaid with dazzling crystal: we had read of rare aladdin’s wondrous cave, and to our own his name we gave, with many a wish the luck were ours to test his lamp’s supernal powers. we reached the barn with merry din, and roused the prisoned brutes within. the old horse thrust his long head out, and grave with wonder gazed about; the cock his lusty greeting said, and forth his speckled harem led; the oxen lashed their tails, and hooked, and mild reproach of hunger looked; the hornëd patriarch of the sheep, like egypt’s amun roused from sleep, shook his sage head with gesture mute, and emphasized with stamp of foot.  all day the gusty north-wind bore the loosening drift its breath before; low circling round its southern zone, the sun through dazzling snow-mist shone. no church-bell lent its christian tone to the savage air, no social smoke curled over woods of snow-hung oak. a solitude made more intense by dreary-voicëd elements, the shrieking of the mindless wind, the moaning tree-boughs swaying blind, and on the glass the unmeaning beat of ghostly finger-tips of sleet. beyond the circle of our hearth no welcome sound of toil or mirth unbound the spell, and testified of human life and thought outside. we minded that the sharpest ear the buried brooklet could not hear, the music of whose liquid lip had been to us companionship, and, in our lonely life, had grown to have an almost human tone.  as night drew on, and, from the crest of wooded knolls that ridged the west, the sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank from sight beneath the smothering bank, we piled, with care, our nightly stack of wood against the chimney-back,— the oaken log, green, huge, and thick, and on its top the stout back-stick; the knotty forestick laid apart, and filled between with curious art the ragged brush; then, hovering near, we watched the first red blaze appear, heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam on whitewashed wall and sagging beam, until the old, rude-furnished room burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom; while radiant with a mimic flame outside the sparkling drift became, and through the bare-boughed lilac-tree our own warm hearth seemed blazing free. the crane and pendent trammels showed, the turks’ heads on the andirons glowed; while childish fancy, prompt to tell the meaning of the miracle, whispered the old rhyme: “under the tree, when fire outdoors burns merrily, there the witches are making tea.”  the moon above the eastern wood shone at its full; the hill-range stood transfigured in the silver flood, its blown snows flashing cold and keen, dead white, save where some sharp ravine took shadow, or the sombre green of hemlocks turned to pitchy black against the whiteness at their back. for such a world and such a night most fitting that unwarming light, which only seemed where’er it fell to make the coldness visible.  shut in from all the world without, we sat the clean-winged hearth about, content to let the north-wind roar in baffled rage at pane and door, while the red logs before us beat the frost-line back with tropic heat; and ever, when a louder blast shook beam and rafter as it passed, the merrier up its roaring draught the great throat of the chimney laughed; the house-dog on his paws outspread laid to the fire his drowsy head, the cat’s dark silhouette on the wall a couchant tiger’s seemed to fall; and, for the winter fireside meet, between the andirons’ straddling feet, the mug of cider simmered slow, the apples sputtered in a row, and, close at hand, the basket stood with nuts from brown october’s wood.  what matter how the night behaved? what matter how the north-wind raved? blow high, blow low, not all its snow could quench our hearth-fire’s ruddy glow. o time and change!—with hair as gray as was my sire’s that winter day, how strange it seems, with so much gone of life and love, to still live on! ah, brother! only i and thou are left of all that circle now,— the dear home faces whereupon that fitful firelight paled and shone. henceforward, listen as we will, the voices of that hearth are still; look where we may, the wide earth o’er, those lighted faces smile no more. we tread the paths their feet have worn, we sit beneath their orchard trees, we hear, like them, the hum of bees and rustle of the bladed corn; we turn the pages that they read, their written words we linger o’er, but in the sun they cast no shade, no voice is heard, no sign is made, no step is on the conscious floor! yet love will dream, and faith will trust, (since he who knows our need is just,) that somehow, somewhere, meet we must. alas for him who never sees the stars shine through his cypress-trees! who, hopeless, lays his dead away, nor looks to see the breaking day across the mournful marbles play! who hath not learned, in hours of faith, the truth to flesh and sense unknown, that life is ever lord of death, and love can never lose its own! we sped the time with stories old, wrought puzzles out, and riddles told, or stammered from our school-book lore “the chief of gambia’s golden shore.” how often since, when all the land was clay in slavery’s shaping hand, as if a far-blown trumpet stirred the languorous sin-sick air, i heard: “does not the voice of reason cry, claim the first right which nature gave, from the red scourge of bondage to fly, nor deign to live a burdened slave!“ our father rode again his ride on memphremagog’s wooded side; sat down again to moose and samp in trapper’s hut and indian camp; lived o’er the old idyllic ease beneath st. françois’ hemlock-trees; again for him the moonlight shone on norman cap and bodiced zone; again he heard the violin play which led the village dance away. and mingled in its merry whirl the grandam and the laughing girl. or, nearer home, our steps he led where salisbury’s level marshes spread mile-wide as flies the laden bee; where merry mowers, hale and strong, swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along the low green prairies of the sea. we shared the fishing off boar’s head, and round the rocky isles of shoals the hake-broil on the drift-wood coals; the chowder on the sand-beach made, dipped by the hungry, steaming hot, with spoons of clam-shell from the pot. we heard the tales of witchcraft old, and dream and sign and marvel told to sleepy listeners as they lay stretched idly on the salted hay, adrift along the winding shores, when favoring breezes deigned to blow the square sail of the gundelow and idle lay the useless oars.  our mother, while she turned her wheel or run the new-knit stocking-heel, told how the indian hordes came down at midnight on concheco town, and how her own great-uncle bore his cruel scalp-mark to fourscore. recalling, in her fitting phrase, so rich and picturesque and free (the common unrhymed poetry of simple life and country ways,) the story of her early days,— she made us welcome to her home; old hearths grew wide to give us room; we stole with her a frightened look at the gray wizard’s conjuring-book, the fame whereof went far and wide through all the simple country side; we heard the hawks at twilight play, the boat-horn on piscataqua, the loon’s weird laughter far away; we fished her little trout-brook, knew what flowers in wood and meadow grew, what sunny hillsides autumn-brown she climbed to shake the ripe nuts down, saw where in sheltered cove and bay, the ducks’ black squadron anchored lay, and heard the wild-geese calling loud beneath the gray november cloud.  then, haply, with a look more grave, and soberer tone, some tale she gave from painful sewel’s ancient tome, beloved in every quaker home, of faith fire-winged by martyrdom, or chalkley’s journal, old and quaint,— gentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint!— who, when the dreary calms prevailed, and water-butt and bread-cask failed, and cruel, hungry eyes pursued his portly presence mad for food, with dark hints muttered under breath of casting lots for life or death, offered, if heaven withheld supplies, to be himself the sacrifice. then, suddenly, as if to save the good man from his living grave, a ripple on the water grew, a school of porpoise flashed in view. “take, eat,” he said, “and be content; these fishes in my stead are sent by him who gave the tangled ram to spare the child of abraham.”  our uncle, innocent of books, was rich in lore of fields and brooks, the ancient teachers never dumb of nature’s unhoused lyceum. in moons and tides and weather wise, he read the clouds as prophecies, and foul or fair could well divine, by many an occult hint and sign, holding the cunning-warded keys to all the woodcraft mysteries; himself to nature’s heart so near that all her voices in his ear of beast or bird had meanings clear, like apollonius of old, who knew the tales the sparrows told, or hermes, who interpreted what the sage cranes of nilus said; a simple, guileless, childlike man, content to live where life began; strong only on his native grounds, the little world of sights and sounds whose girdle was the parish bounds, whereof his fondly partial pride the common features magnified, as surrey hills to mountains grew in white of selborne’s loving view,— he told how teal and loon he shot, and how the eagle’s eggs he got, the feats on pond and river done, the prodigies of rod and gun; till, warming with the tales he told, forgotten was the outside cold, the bitter wind unheeded blew, from ripening corn the pigeons flew, the partridge drummed i’ the wood, the mink went fishing down the river-brink. in fields with bean or clover gay, the woodchuck, like a hermit gray, peered from the doorway of his cell; the muskrat plied the mason’s trade, and tier by tier his mud-walls laid; and from the shagbark overhead the grizzled squirrel dropped his shell.  next, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer and voice in dreams i see and hear,— the sweetest woman ever fate perverse denied a household mate, who, lonely, homeless, not the less found peace in love’s unselfishness, and welcome wheresoe’er she went, a calm and gracious element, whose presence seemed the sweet income and womanly atmosphere of home,— called up her girlhood memories, the huskings and the apple-bees, the sleigh-rides and the summer sails, weaving through all the poor details and homespun warp of circumstance a golden woof-thread of romance. for well she kept her genial mood and simple faith of maidenhood; before her still a cloud-land lay, the mirage loomed across her way; the morning dew, that dries so soon with others, glistened at her noon; through years of toil and soil and care, from glossy tress to thin gray hair, all unprofaned she held apart the virgin fancies of the heart. be shame to him of woman born who hath for such but thought of scorn.  there, too, our elder sister plied her evening task the stand beside; a full, rich nature, free to trust, truthful and almost sternly just, impulsive, earnest, prompt to act, and make her generous thought a fact, keeping with many a light disguise the secret of self-sacrifice. o heart sore-tried! thou hast the best that heaven itself could give thee,—rest, rest from all bitter thoughts and things! how many a poor one’s blessing went with thee beneath the low green tent whose curtain never outward swings!  as one who held herself a part of all she saw, and let her heart against the household bosom lean, upon the motley-braided mat our youngest and our dearest sat, lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes, now bathed in the unfading green and holy peace of paradise. oh, looking from some heavenly hill, or from the shade of saintly palms, or silver reach of river calms, do those large eyes behold me still? with me one little year ago:— the chill weight of the winter snow for months upon her grave has lain; and now, when summer south-winds blow and brier and harebell bloom again, i tread the pleasant paths we trod, i see the violet-sprinkled sod whereon she leaned, too frail and weak the hillside flowers she loved to seek, yet following me where’er i went with dark eyes full of love’s content. the birds are glad; the brier-rose fills the air with sweetness; all the hills stretch green to june’s unclouded sky; but still i wait with ear and eye for something gone which should be nigh, a loss in all familiar things, in flower that blooms, and bird that sings. and yet, dear heart! remembering thee, am i not richer than of old? safe in thy immortality, what change can reach the wealth i hold? what chance can mar the pearl and gold thy love hath left in trust with me? and while in life’s late afternoon, where cool and long the shadows grow, i walk to meet the night that soon shall shape and shadow overflow, i cannot feel that thou art far, since near at need the angels are; and when the sunset gates unbar, shall i not see thee waiting stand, and, white against the evening star, the welcome of thy beckoning hand?  brisk wielder of the birch and rule, the master of the district school held at the fire his favored place, its warm glow lit a laughing face fresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared the uncertain prophecy of beard. he teased the mitten-blinded cat, played cross-pins on my uncle’s hat, sang songs, and told us what befalls in classic dartmouth’s college halls. born the wild northern hills among, from whence his yeoman father wrung by patient toil subsistence scant, not competence and yet not want, he early gained the power to pay his cheerful, self-reliant way; could doff at ease his scholar’s gown to peddle wares from town to town; or through the long vacation’s reach in lonely lowland districts teach, where all the droll experience found at stranger hearths in boarding round, the moonlit skater’s keen delight, the sleigh-drive through the frosty night, the rustic party, with its rough accompaniment of blind-man’s-buff, and whirling-plate, and forfeits paid, his winter task a pastime made. happy the snow-locked homes wherein he tuned his merry violin, or played the athlete in the barn, or held the good dame’s winding-yarn, or mirth-provoking versions told of classic legends rare and old, wherein the scenes of greece and rome had all the commonplace of home, and little seemed at best the odds ’twixt yankee pedlers and old gods; where pindus-born arachthus took the guise of any grist-mill brook, and dread olympus at his will became a huckleberry hill.  a careless boy that night he seemed; but at his desk he had the look and air of one who wisely schemed, and hostage from the future took in trainëd thought and lore of book. large-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he shall freedom’s young apostles be, who, following in war’s bloody trail, shall every lingering wrong assail; all chains from limb and spirit strike, uplift the black and white alike; scatter before their swift advance the darkness and the ignorance, the pride, the lust, the squalid sloth, which nurtured treason’s monstrous growth, made murder pastime, and the hell of prison-torture possible; the cruel lie of caste refute, old forms remould, and substitute for slavery’s lash the freeman’s will, for blind routine, wise-handed skill; a school-house plant on every hill, stretching in radiate nerve-lines thence the quick wires of intelligence; till north and south together brought shall own the same electric thought, in peace a common flag salute, and, side by side in labor’s free and unresentful rivalry, harvest the fields wherein they fought.  another guest that winter night flashed back from lustrous eyes the light. unmarked by time, and yet not young, the honeyed music of her tongue and words of meekness scarcely told a nature passionate and bold, strong, self-concentred, spurning guide, its milder features dwarfed beside her unbent will’s majestic pride. she sat among us, at the best, a not unfeared, half-welcome guest, rebuking with her cultured phrase our homeliness of words and ways. a certain pard-like, treacherous grace swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash, lent the white teeth their dazzling flash; and under low brows, black with night, rayed out at times a dangerous light; the sharp heat-lightnings of her face presaging ill to him whom fate condemned to share her love or hate. a woman tropical, intense in thought and act, in soul and sense, she blended in a like degree the vixen and the devotee, revealing with each freak or feint the temper of petruchio’s kate, the raptures of siena’s saint. her tapering hand and rounded wrist had facile power to form a fist; the warm, dark languish of her eyes was never safe from wrath’s surprise. brows saintly calm and lips devout knew every change of scowl and pout; and the sweet voice had notes more high and shrill for social battle-cry.  since then what old cathedral town has missed her pilgrim staff and gown, what convent-gate has held its lock against the challenge of her knock! through smyrna’s plague-hushed thoroughfares, up sea-set malta’s rocky stairs, gray olive slopes of hills that hem thy tombs and shrines, jerusalem, or startling on her desert throne the crazy queen of lebanon with claims fantastic as her own, her tireless feet have held their way; and still, unrestful, bowed, and gray, she watches under eastern skies, with hope each day renewed and fresh, the lord’s quick coming in the flesh, whereof she dreams and prophesies!  where’er her troubled path may be, the lord’s sweet pity with her go! the outward wayward life we see, the hidden springs we may not know. nor is it given us to discern what threads the fatal sisters spun, through what ancestral years has run the sorrow with the woman born, what forged her cruel chain of moods, what set her feet in solitudes, and held the love within her mute, what mingled madness in the blood, a life-long discord and annoy, water of tears with oil of joy, and hid within the folded bud perversities of flower and fruit. it is not ours to separate the tangled skein of will and fate, to show what metes and bounds should stand upon the soul’s debatable land, and between choice and providence divide the circle of events; but he who knows our frame is just, merciful and compassionate, and full of sweet assurances and hope for all the language is, that he remembereth we are dust!  at last the great logs, crumbling low, sent out a dull and duller glow, the bull’s-eye watch that hung in view, ticking its weary circuit through, pointed with mutely warning sign its black hand to the hour of nine. that sign the pleasant circle broke: my uncle ceased his pipe to smoke, knocked from its bowl the refuse gray, and laid it tenderly away; then roused himself to safely cover the dull red brands with ashes over. and while, with care, our mother laid the work aside, her steps she stayed one moment, seeking to express her grateful sense of happiness for food and shelter, warmth and health, and love’s contentment more than wealth, with simple wishes (not the weak, vain prayers which no fulfilment seek, but such as warm the generous heart, o’er-prompt to do with heaven its part) that none might lack, that bitter night, for bread and clothing, warmth and light.  within our beds awhile we heard the wind that round the gables roared, with now and then a ruder shock, which made our very bedsteads rock. we heard the loosened clapboards tost, the board-nails snapping in the frost; and on us, through the unplastered wall, felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall. but sleep stole on, as sleep will do when hearts are light and life is new; faint and more faint the murmurs grew, till in the summer-land of dreams they softened to the sound of streams, low stir of leaves, and dip of oars, and lapsing waves on quiet shores.  next morn we wakened with the shout of merry voices high and clear; and saw the teamsters drawing near to break the drifted highways out. down the long hillside treading slow we saw the half-buried oxen go, shaking the snow from heads uptost, their straining nostrils white with frost. before our door the straggling train drew up, an added team to gain. the elders threshed their hands a-cold, passed, with the cider-mug, their jokes from lip to lip; the younger folks down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled, then toiled again the cavalcade o’er windy hill, through clogged ravine, and woodland paths that wound between low drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed. from every barn a team afoot, at every house a new recruit, where, drawn by nature’s subtlest law, haply the watchful young men saw sweet doorway pictures of the curls and curious eyes of merry girls, lifting their hands in mock defence against the snow-ball’s compliments, and reading in each missive tost the charm with eden never lost.  we heard once more the sleigh-bells’ sound; and, following where the teamsters led, the wise old doctor went his round, just pausing at our door to say, in the brief autocratic way of one who, prompt at duty’s call, was free to urge her claim on all, that some poor neighbor sick abed at night our mother’s aid would need. for, one in generous thought and deed, what mattered in the sufferer’s sight the quaker matron’s inward light, the doctor’s mail of calvin’s creed? all hearts confess the saints elect who, twain in faith, in love agree, and melt not in an acid sect the christian pearl of charity!  so days went on: a week had passed since the great world was heard from last. the almanac we studied o’er, read and reread our little store of books and pamphlets, scarce a score; one harmless novel, mostly hid from younger eyes, a book forbid, and poetry, (or good or bad, a single book was all we had,) where ellwood’s meek, drab-skirted muse, a stranger to the heathen nine, sang, with a somewhat nasal whine, the wars of david and the jews. at last the floundering carrier bore the village paper to our door. lo! broadening outward as we read, to warmer zones the horizon spread in panoramic length unrolled we saw the marvels that it told. before us passed the painted creeks, and daft mcgregor on his raids in costa rica’s everglades. and up taygetos winding slow rode ypsilanti’s mainote greeks, a turk’s head at each saddle-bow! welcome to us its week-old news, its corner for the rustic muse, its monthly gauge of snow and rain, its record, mingling in a breath the wedding bell and dirge of death: jest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale, the latest culprit sent to jail; its hue and cry of stolen and lost, its vendue sales and goods at cost, and traffic calling loud for gain. we felt the stir of hall and street, the pulse of life that round us beat; the chill embargo of the snow was melted in the genial glow; wide swung again our ice-locked door, and all the world was ours once more!  clasp, angel of the backword look and folded wings of ashen gray and voice of echoes far away, the brazen covers of thy book; the weird palimpsest old and vast, wherein thou hid’st the spectral past; where, closely mingling, pale and glow the characters of joy and woe; the monographs of outlived years, or smile-illumed or dim with tears, green hills of life that slope to death, and haunts of home, whose vistaed trees shade off to mournful cypresses with the white amaranths underneath. even while i look, i can but heed the restless sands’ incessant fall, importunate hours that hours succeed, each clamorous with its own sharp need, and duty keeping pace with all. shut down and clasp with heavy lids; i hear again the voice that bids the dreamer leave his dream midway for larger hopes and graver fears: life greatens in these later years, the century’s aloe flowers to-day!  yet, haply, in some lull of life, some truce of god which breaks its strife, the worldling’s eyes shall gather dew, dreaming in throngful city ways of winter joys his boyhood knew; and dear and early friends—the few who yet remain—shall pause to view these flemish pictures of old days; sit with me by the homestead hearth, and stretch the hands of memory forth to warm them at the wood-fire’s blaze! and thanks untraced to lips unknown shall greet me like the odors blown from unseen meadows newly mown, or lilies floating in some pond, wood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond; the traveller owns the grateful sense of sweetness near, he knows not whence, and, pausing, takes with forehead bare the benediction of the air.

 kant says time is neither event nor thing.  well, i think. that’s that.  but then teresa calls. she’s found my old letters. there are dead dogs in them, old boyfriends; the miscarriage is happening (has happened) and i have to catch a plane. the plane has      (not yet) taken off.  sundials, t squares, heartbeats, and the equinox. in places of worship, incense burns. all to mark no thing.  here, wind moves water in one direction, then another. some mornings, nothing ripples, not leaves, not iridescence on birdwing, beetle back. some mornings, both: stillness, unrest.  last season’s loon calls. and sometimes? i can’t remember the lake where i first heard that sound, though the vision of it rises through a paint-flecked pane.  on my morning walk: a hawk perched on a telephone wire above what used to be a hayfield: rusted new holland baler, bobolinks and meadowlarks saved from the mower. that was a generation ago, dead farmers, dead cows.  now is not the time, moles, voles, mice, to dart into the light.  nothing stops in stillness except solstice when the sun stands still in declination.  i should tell someone this, that we are not propelled beyond a moment of observation, even loss, into something else: field edge, lakeside, motherhood. but that, instead, we are always on our way.  on my return, the wire’s empty. the hawk has hunted or not, is sated or continues, hungry. hunger, at least, returns.  once, in different water, my daughters waded naked after mussels. appendages, these daughters were. i was accustomed to the creases behind their knees where i kept their pulse.  keep these, too: ships’ bells and steeple chimes, an hourglass, the pharaoh’s water clock.  now, on a floating dock, my daughters sun themselves, swing limbs above water that soon enough will be ice.  these days, you can lift saliva off the back of a stamp, determine who licked it. and that woman? that sender?  she will have stopped and she will not yet have stopped        and she will still be  bleeding.

 the galloping collection of boards are the house which i afforded one evening to walk into just as the night came down.  dark inside, the candle lit of its own free will, the attic groaned then, the stairs led me up into the air.  from outside, it must have seemed a wonder that it was the inside he as me saw in the dark there.  
NEW POEM
 observe the cautious toadstools still on the lawn today though they grow over-evening; sun shrinks them away. pale and proper and rootless, they righteously extort their living from the living. i have been their sort.  see by our blocked foundation the cold, archaic clay, stiff and clinging and sterile as children mold at play or as the lord god fashioned before he breathed it breath. the earth we dig and carry for flowers, is strong in death.  woman, we are the rich soil, friable and humble, where all our murders rot, where our old deaths crumble and fortify my reach far from you, wide and free, though i have set my root in you and am your tree.  
NEW POEM
 you shout my name from beyond my dreams, beyond the picture window of this rosarito beach house. rushing from bed to shore i glimpse their backs— volcanoes rising out of the sea. your back, a blue-black silhouette, feet wet with the wash of morning waves. fountains spring from mammal minds, my hands lifting a splash of sand. i'm on my knees, toes finding a cool prayer beneath them, fingers pressing sea foam to my temples, while you open arms wide as a generation, raise them to a compass point, dive. if you could reach them, you would ride their fins under the horizon, then surf the crash of waves left in their wake. and if i could grasp my own fear, i'd drown it, leave it breathless and blue as this ocean, as the brilliant backs of whales surfacing for air.  
NEW POEM
 my love is in a light attire among the apple trees, where the gay winds do most desire to run in companies.  there, where the gay winds stay to woo the young leaves as they pass, my love goes slowly, bending to her shadow on the grass.  and where the sky’s a pale blue cup over the laughing land, my love goes lightly, holding up her dress with dainty hand.  
NEW POEM
 from an evening's love calm was the even, and clear was the sky, and the new budding flowers did spring, when all alone went amyntas and i to hear the sweet nightingale sing; i sate, and he laid him down by me; but scarcely his breath he could draw; for when with a fear, he began to draw near, he was dash'd with a ha ha ha ha!  he blush'd to himself, and lay still for a while, and his modesty curb'd his desire; but straight i convinc'd all his fear with a smile, which added new flames to his fire. o silvia, said he, you are cruel, to keep your poor lover in awe; then once more he press'd with his hand to my breast, but was dash'd with a ha ha ha ha!  i knew 'twas his passion that caus'd all his fear; and therefore i pitied his case: i whisper'd him softly, there's nobody near, and laid my cheek close to his face: but as he grew bolder and bolder, a shepherd came by us and saw; and just as our bliss we began with a kiss, he laugh'd out with a ha ha ha ha!  
NEW POEM
 go and catch a falling star, get with child a mandrake root, tell me where all past years are, or who cleft the devil's foot, teach me to hear mermaids singing, or to keep off envy's stinging, and find what wind serves to advance an honest mind.  if thou be'st born to strange sights, things invisible to see, ride ten thousand days and nights, till age snow white hairs on thee, thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me, all strange wonders that befell thee, and swear, no where lives a woman true, and fair.  if thou find'st one, let me know, such a pilgrimage were sweet; yet do not, i would not go, though at next door we might meet; though she were true, when you met her, and last, till you write your letter, yet she will be false, ere i come, to two, or three.      poetry out loud note : in the print anthology, this poem is titled simply "song." the student may give either title during the recitation.  
NEW POEM
 i prithee spare me gentle boy, press me no more for that slight toy, that foolish trifle of an heart; i swear it will not do its part, though thou dost thine, employ’st thy pow’r and art.  for through long custom it has known the little secrets, and is grown sullen and wise, will have its will, and like old hawks pursues that still that makes least sport, flies only where’t can kill.  some youth that has not made his story, will think perchance the pain’s the glory, and mannerly sit out love’s feast; i shall be carving of the best, rudely call for the last course ’fore the rest.  and oh when once that course is past, how short a time the feast doth last; men rise away and scarce say grace, or civilly once thank the face that did invite, but seek another place.  
NEW POEM
 i’ve stayed in the front yard all my life. i want a peek at the back where it’s rough and untended and hungry weed grows. a girl gets sick of a rose.  i want to go in the back yard now and maybe down the alley, to where the charity children play. i want a good time today.  they do some wonderful things. they have some wonderful fun. my mother sneers, but i say it’s fine how they don’t have to go in at quarter to nine. my mother, she tells me that johnnie mae will grow up to be a bad woman. that george’ll be taken to jail soon or late (on account of last winter he sold our back gate).  but i say it’s fine. honest, i do. and i’d like to be a bad woman, too, and wear the brave stockings of night-black lace and strut down the streets with paint on my face.  
NEW POEM
 (from twelfth night ) o mistress mine where are you roaming? o stay and hear, your true love's coming, that can sing both high and low. trip no further pretty sweeting. journeys end in lovers' meeting, every wise man's son doth know.  what is love, 'tis not hereafter, present mirth, hath present laughter: what's to come, is still unsure. in delay there lies no plenty, then come kiss me sweet and twenty: youth's a stuff will not endure.

 came now to another crossroads. stick people stood awaiting us, to the left, straight ahead, to the right. what was that song you sang, they asked, spoke without sound sound’s immanence, not without song but only one song, the one song summon- ing song’s eclipse... the one song sang song’s inconsequence, crooned it could not’ve been otherwise, song song’s own lament... the one song sang song’s irrelevance, we were exhausted, we looked straight ahead, left, right. the stick people’s question fa- tigued us, glyphed riddle whose decipherment they said we’d someday be, exegetes against our will... lack, reluctance, pallor, eidolon. crossroads cryptogram, they themselves were sing- ing, nothing not what could be seen they said, soul not sign if not eyelight, song more what could be seen than they could say, wan unwillingness they said... slick stick people, tricky, soul a sick thing they said... signs all said stick city. stick city straight ahead, to the left, to the right, signs pointed every which way... stick sublimity sent us reeling, a we that wasn’t we against one that was. mass, intangible we it was we were, beads thrown off in a row... we’d have given anything to get to stick city and there we were. whatever way we took would take us there. stick city loomed ahead and to the left and to the right, any which way but in back of us, stick city meant no turning back... signs all said stick city. we read them all out loud, “stick city.” “styxicity,” itamar quipped... it wasn’t water we crossed, it wasn’t hell we were in. stick city housed our hearts’ desires we were told, stick city stood without end or assistance, line long since what stuck... line was all point, point all extensity, stick’s own deictic drop... no longer point less point than point’s target, stick city made them one and the same... so it was on to where the signs said next, stick the one place we were yet to arrive at, diddie wa diddie’s twin. a winding road it now was we were on, so curved we could see our backs. no work, no worry up ahead we heard, music’s utopic stir... hogs lay stuck with knives and forks, chickens likewise we heard. a wall of beats for backup, stick city

stick city lay before us, lied about. legbaland it might’ve been... diddie wa diddie’s non-identical twin if twin it was, no way the way we heard it was    •   stick-figure escorts ushered us in, pointed out what was what. stick people's gait was flawless, they said, unstick people limped on sticks... a strand of horsehair lay in the road, hair from a horse's tail. come rain it became a snake, would-be stick though stick city said no... it was getting to be late again, the arcade's light less intense... come night we lay under a horse, shouted voiceless trying to wake each other up and woke up, coiled hair stiffened with earwax, as if at last we were stick city's own... not so we saw soon enough. no home, no haven was it, noise what of it we could keep... west l.a. it might've been,

alternate, half where we were nowhere near where we were, were where's discontent... it was getting to be light again, noise the new day's largesse. sound was what sign turned out from, sound itself exed out... what the song was we sang no longer what we were asked, stick inquisitors gathered, mum to the bone. frown, furrowed brow, grimace the glyphs met us, faces lined up in a row. line was what pressed us, point egged us on, what the song was we sang no song we sang, what the song was we sang moot... the strand-of-horsehair-become-a-snake became a rope around our necks, rope what the song we sang was. we'd have given anything to say stick city was where we were... breath it was we gave, rope round our necks... we were neck- less, bobbing heads, barbershop xtet, calabashes hit with sticks. whatever we were, whatever noise there was we made ours. “this is our dispatch,” we said... euphemistic necktie, eu- phemistic float. horsehair tickling the tops of our throats. wet, euphemistic scruff... as it was getting to be noon we got our necks and bodies back. a cartoon watch dog bit us, a pinscher with painted lips. we were stick people now, initiates. stick legs only a blur, we were running, pant legs and hem- lines ripped... cross. chiliasm. crisis. stick bisected stick. more hopeless the less we needed it, less real the more shot with stick vaccine, less real the more stick we

 let me call a ghost, love, so it be little: in december we took no thought for the weather.  whom now shall i thank for this wealth of water? your heart loves harbors where i am a stranger.  where was it we lay needing no other twelve days and twelve nights in each other’s eyes?  or was it at babel and the days too small we spoke our own tongue needing no other?  if a seed grow green set a stone upon it that it learn thereby holy charity.  if you must smile always on that other, cut me from ear to ear and we all smile together.  
NEW POEM
 strephon, your breach of faith and trust affords me no surprise; a man who grateful was, or just, might make my wonder rise.  that heart to you so fondly tied, with pleasure wore its chain, but from your cold neglectful pride, found liberty again.  for this no wrath inflames my mind, my thanks are due to thee; such thanks as gen'rous victors find, who set their captives free.  
NEW POEM
 sweetest love, i do not go, for weariness of thee, nor in hope the world can show a fitter love for me; but since that i must die at last, 'tis best to use myself in jest thus by feign'd deaths to die.  yesternight the sun went hence, and yet is here today; he hath no desire nor sense, nor half so short a way: then fear not me, but believe that i shall make speedier journeys, since i take more wings and spurs than he.  o how feeble is man's power, that if good fortune fall, cannot add another hour, nor a lost hour recall! but come bad chance, and we join to'it our strength, and we teach it art and length, itself o'er us to'advance.  when thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind, but sigh'st my soul away; when thou weep'st, unkindly kind, my life's blood doth decay. it cannot be that thou lov'st me, as thou say'st, if in thine my life thou waste, that art the best of me.  let not thy divining heart forethink me any ill; destiny may take thy part, and may thy fears fulfil; but think that we are but turn'd aside to sleep; they who one another keep alive, ne'er parted be.  
NEW POEM
 after porfirio barba jacob’s canción de la vida profunda variable, changeable, yes, there are days when people like us are like that. maybe under  some other sky something like glory smiles on us, maybe there life is clear, maybe there things open up  on the way the sea stretches out to the horizon— but us, we’re blown by chance the way wind blows  blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way.   and then there are days when we feel april, the fields of april making us feel our bodies  longing to be held and fucked into oblivion, bodies fertile as a field in april, swollen,  trembling to be touched: and under the influences of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured  into us like rain, that thing called “soul” sprouts and branches and entangles us  in lush bowers and thickets of illusion.   oh yes, days come along when we’re calm, clear —childhood sunsets, lagoons rippling sapphire!—  days when a verse, a sudden whistle, days when a mountain and bird passing over it, days when even our own pain  and what we feel it to be like make us smile. and sure, there are days when we're so disgusting, so sordid to ourselves  it’s like we’re dark stone in the darkness inside flint: then nighttime surprises us,  its lamplight dizzying, cold, profuse, glinting off tossed coins of the good, the terrible  shining with the gleam of that primal metal.   and other days come, come when women want to cry their come cries and use us  as their own, days when we’re itching to get a woman naked, and then we can’t face it, can’t  stand it somehow, they want us but we don’t know how to want them back: arm tightening around  a waist, hand cupping a breast, we don’t dare touch the roundness of an apple or a pear,  the round earth spins us off into space.   and then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove  sounds like weeping: and what some idiot called the soul whines and wails and carries on  with what some other idiot calls “the pain of the world”: and maybe not god himself, that absolute fool, can make that wind less cutting, or make it stop.   and then there comes, certain to come, oh my earth i love beyond any of my days, a day . . . a day . . . a day  when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor up out of the bottom muck, and nothing can withstand  that wind blowing by, talking to itself, talking, talking . . . and the day is mine and yours and every living thing’s . . .  the day when nobody and nothing can keep us from getting up and going, no matter who we are . . .  the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving.  
NEW POEM
 drink to me only with thine eyes, and i will pledge with mine; or leave a kiss but in the cup, and i’ll not look for wine. the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine; but might i of jove’s nectar sup, i would not change for thine.  i sent thee late a rosy wreath, not so much honouring thee as giving it a hope, that there it could not withered be. but thou thereon didst only breathe, and sent’st it back to me; since when it grows, and smells, i swear, not of itself, but thee.  
NEW POEM
 ask me no more where jove bestows, when june is past, the fading rose; for in your beauty's orient deep these flowers as in their causes, sleep.  ask me no more whither doth stray the golden atoms of the day; for in pure love heaven did prepare those powders to enrich your hair.  ask me no more whither doth haste the nightingale when may is past; for in your sweet dividing throat she winters and keeps warm her note.  ask me no more where those stars light that downwards fall in dead of night; for in your eyes they sit, and there, fixed become as in their sphere.  ask me no more if east or west the phoenix builds her spicy nest; for unto you at last she flies, and in your fragrant bosom dies.  
NEW POEM
 when, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes, i all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon myself and curse my fate, wishing me like to one more rich in hope, featured like him, like him with friends possessed, desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope, with what i most enjoy contented least; yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, haply i think on thee, and then my state, (like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate; for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings.  
NEW POEM
 full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye, kissing with golden face the meadows green, gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy; anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide, stealing unseen to west with this disgrace. even so my sun one early morn did shine with all-triumphant splendour on my brow; but out, alack! he was but one hour mine; the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now. yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth; suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.  
NEW POEM
 not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time. when wasteful war shall statues overturn, and broils root out the work of masonry, nor mars his sword nor war’s quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory. ’gainst death and all-oblivious enmity shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom. so, till the judgement that yourself arise, you live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.

 dost see how unregarded now that piece of beauty passes? there was a time when i did vow to that alone; but mark the fate of faces; the red and white works now no more on me than if it could not charm, or i not see.  and yet the face continues good, and i have still desires, am still the selfsame flesh and blood, as apt to melt and suffer from those fires; oh some kind pow’r unriddle where it lies, whether my heart be faulty, or her eyes?  she ev’ry day her man does kill, and i as often die; neither her power then, nor my will can question’d be. what is the mystery? sure beauty’s empires, like to greater states, have certain periods set, and hidden fates.  
NEW POEM
 you rose from our embrace and the small light spread like an aureole around you. the long parabola of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh i saw permute itself through unfolding and unlimited minuteness in the movement of your tall tread, the spine-root swaying, the picasso-like éclat of scissoring slender legs. i knew some law of being was at work. at one time i had said that love bestows such values, and so it does, but the old man in his canto was right and wise: ubi amor ibi ocullus est. always i wanted to give and in wanting was the poet. a man now, aging, i know the best of love is not to bestow, but to recognize.  
NEW POEM
 to mr. lawrence lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son, now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire, where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire help waste a sullen day; what may be won from the hard season gaining? time will run on smoother, till favonius re-inspire the frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire the lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor spun. what neat repast shall feast us, light and choice, of attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise to hear the lute well touch'd, or artful voice warble immortal notes and tuscan air? he who of those delights can judge, and spare to interpose them oft, is not unwise.  
NEW POEM
 alas, 'tis true i have gone here and there and made myself a motley to the view, gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear, made old offences of affections new. most true it is that i have look'd on truth askance and strangely: but, by all above, these blenches gave my heart another youth, and worse essays prov'd thee my best of love. now all is done, have what shall have no end! mine appetite, i never more will grind on newer proof, to try an older friend, a god in love, to whom i am confin'd. then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, even to thy pure and most most loving breast.  
NEW POEM
 o, for my sake do you with fortune chide, the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, that did not better for my life provide than public means which public manners breeds. thence comes it that my name receives a brand, and almost thence my nature is subdu'd to what it works in, like the dyer's hand. pity me then and wish i were renew'd; whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection; no bitterness that i will bitter think, nor double penance, to correct correction. pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye even that your pity is enough to cure me.  
NEW POEM
 th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust in action; and till action, lust is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust, enjoyed no sooner but despisèd straight, past reason hunted; and, no sooner had past reason hated as a swallowed bait on purpose laid to make the taker mad; mad in pursuit and in possession so, had, having, and in quest to have, extreme; a bliss in proof and proved, a very woe; before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream. all this the world well knows; yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

 why &amp; what is sweetness all alone? either that or it becomes, alas, fleeting, which actually helps, because of rhythm. &amp; there’s a pale intensity to truth, no matter how pale it is on the levels we receive on. i mean, the minute you invent a time interval the more it seems to “jelly out” the excitation of accidents;zum beispiel, “saginaw, michigan.” after a while, we almost expect him or her to inveigle us into a cafe without bay-breasted warblers. it’s almost like we have a streak of orange-smell which nobody’ll pay for because they can’t talk to it, although that’s probably all wrong, or at least falsified by its very mention, like gravity. do you agree?  
NEW POEM
 if i leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange and be all to me? shall i never miss home-talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, when i look up, to drop on a new range of walls and floors ... another home than this? nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is filled by dead eyes too tender to know change? that's hardest. if to conquer love, has tried, to conquer grief, tries more ... as all things prove; for grief indeed is love and grief beside. alas, i have grieved so i am hard to love. yet love me—wilt thou? open thine heart wide, and fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.  
NEW POEM
 once i loved a spider when i was born a fly, a velvet-footed spider with a gown of rainbow-dye. she ate my wings and gloated. she bound me with a hair. she drove me to her parlor above her winding stair. to educate young spiders she took me all apart. my ghost came back to haunt her. i saw her eat my heart.  
NEW POEM
 now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost candies the grass, or casts an icy cream upon the silver lake or crystal stream; but the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth, and makes it tender; gives a sacred birth to the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree the drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee. now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring in triumph to the world the youthful spring. the valleys, hills, and woods in rich array welcome the coming of the long'd-for may. now all things smile, only my love doth lour; nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power to melt that marble ice, which still doth hold her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold. the ox, which lately did for shelter fly into the stall, doth now securely lie in open fields; and love no more is made by the fireside, but in the cooler shade amyntas now doth with his chloris sleep under a sycamore, and all things keep time with the season; only she doth carry june in her eyes, in her heart january.

 for gra'ma there was always fabric in your lap and a whistle in your heart. a sweet sap to be sucked waited in the garden. nymphs of newts nestled under rock, your role as she who brings the waters intact. between the trilling of the crickets educating into the night and the sad sack of cans in the mornings something grew, flourished in the dark — vines as sturdy as telephone wire writhed in the breezes. you patched together a blanket of us, sewed together the mismatched and lopped off edges. and anger grew a twin, ripped through the bermuda grass, something stubborn and determined: me, in a leather patchwork skirt, the bitter lemon song returning to its beginning over and over on the howdie doody phonograph, a handful of bandages, a faceful of ghosts delivered from the mirrors. how did you stand it? all of it. us crunching through your set life, kids scuffling through the mounds of leave. always making do. your sunshine eyes, those stenciled memories where we still live.  
NEW POEM
 we can't remember her name, but we remember where we buried her. in a blanket the color of a sky that refuses birds.  the illiterate owls interrogate us from the trees, and we answer, we don't know. maybe we named her dolores, for our grandmother,  meaning sadness, meaning the mild kisses of a priest. maybe we called her ruth, after the missionary who gave us  a rifle and counterfeit wine. we blindfolded our sister and tied her hands because she groped the fence looking for the rabid fox  we nailed to a post. katydids sang with insistent summer urge and the cavalier moon grew more slender. in the coyote hour,  we offered benedictions for a child we may have named aja, meaning unborn, meaning the stillness that entered us,  which is the stillness inside the burnt piano, which is also the woman we untie, who is the mother of stillness.

 1.  even the pole bean tendrils sought out and gripped their frames within six hours of my setting them. one of the things that is breaking my heart is that i can’t trust language to express any thanks. my pole beans, my honeybees, my coyotes, my dog, all my good horses.  2.  the black mare i shouldn’t have bought and bought, and once i had, should have shipped, bucked me, too, the first time i got up. but god she was a beauty. i thought if i just rode her i could ride her down. her name was sara and we kept it at that.  all she wanted to do was run. ears back, flat out, nose pushed into the next life. i wanted her to learn to walk.  3.  after about a year of chop i turned her uphill on a good gravel road and said, “ok, you bitch, you want to run?” i let go her head and gave her the steel. i’d never been on a horse so fast. i’ve never been on one since. so fast you couldn’t count the beats in the rhythm of her gait. suicidal. but when, after some miles, she started to flag, i said, “i thought you wanted to run,” and dug her out again.  4.  the pole bean tendrils sought their frames within six hours of my setting them. they broke my heart. they gripped.  5.  a patch of sunlight mottled the shade. whether she never saw the root that snaked through the shadow or was just too far in front of herself, i’ll never know. she stumbled and fell. first on her knees then over. we rasped together down the gravel road, black mare on top of me. we rasped to a halt. she jumped to her feet. she stared at me. i could see the bone in both her knees. ribbons of hide hanging.  blood like volunteer firemen beginning to rise to the occasion.  6.  ten years later, today, i’m riding her. i keep her reined in most of the time. she tosses her head, snaps tie-downs.  she dances and whirls, doubles under and rears incessantly.  she makes me the butt of ridicule: “so, uh, jim, how old is that mare?” “she must be twenty now.” “don’t you think it’s time she was broke?” every once in a while i let her run and break my heart. anyone watching stops breathing.  7.  if i ever get to heaven and know who i am, i’d like to over- hear my daughter tell a story to her children. “sometimes my dad used to ride this black mare...”

 think of the woman who first touched fire to a hollow stone filled with seal oil, how she fiddled with fuel and flame until blue shadows before and after her filled her house, crowded the underground, then fled like sky-captains chasing the aurora’s whale tale green beyond the earth’s curve. her tenth summer, the elders let her raise her issum, seal pup orphaned when hunters brought in her mother, their grins of plenty broad, red. the women slit the hard belly. plopped among the ruby innards steaming on rough-cut planks blinked a new sea-child whose first sound came out a question in the old language, a question that in one throaty bark asked who, meaning what family is this? what comfort do you provide for guests? do you let strangers remain strangers? the women rinsed the slick pup in cool water, crafted a pouch for her to suck. then the young girl whose hands held light even when the room did not brought this new being beside her bed, let it scatter babiche and split birch gathered for snowshoes, let it nose the caribou neck hairs bearding her dance fans. they held up the fans to their foreheads, playing white hair, playing old. in the time when women do not sew the seal danced at her first potlatch. and when the lamps burned down, no one could see any difference between waves in rock, waves in sea. the pup lifted her nose, licked salt from seven stars, and slipped light back among silvers and chum light among the ghostly belugas swimming far north to offer themselves.  
NEW POEM
 you remember the incredible shrinking man? i said. well, last night i dreamed i was him. it began the same way.  the shirt cuffs were the first thing that came to my attention, drooping down over my knuckles in the bedroom mirror.  and my waistband and shoes were getting looser by the day. within weeks you could perch me on your knee like a male doll.  later you would put me to bed in the empty matchbox. you failed to watch for the spider that came to explore me.  i fought her with a darning needle, a button my shield. she retreated from me on a thread. i followed her down  to the cellar. how i made my way back i’ll never know. it took me days to travel over the quilt to your hand.  no longer a hand but an alpine range of sleeping flesh. i crawled into an open pore and entered your bloodstream.  
NEW POEM
 he slid the stiff blade up to my ear: oh, fear,  this should have been thirst, a cheapening act. but i lacked,  as usual, the crucial disbelief. sticky, cold, a billfold  wet in my mouth, wrists bound by his belt, i felt  like the boy in a briny night pool, he who found the drowned  body, yet still somehow swam with an unknown joy. that boy.  
NEW POEM
 for rlb pass by the showy rose, blabbing open, suckling a shiny beetle;  pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow—  this love is a lichen,  alga and fungus made one fleck, feeding on what it feeds,  growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace, a double thumbprint,  its bloom distinguishable, with practice, from its dormant phase,  crocheting its singular habit over time, a faithful stain bound to its home,  etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows.  
NEW POEM
 for m.b. the answer is entropy—how smell works— little bits of everything—always spinning off from where they were—flying off at random into the world—which is to say into air.  there are other ways of solid to gas— they’re substance specific, like iodine, or dry ice—how i felt when i saw you— straight to a new state without passing through expected ones—as though enough of me left at the moment you appeared that i could never be whole without you—apply heat—i turn straight into ether.  
NEW POEM
 was he then adam of the burning way? hid away in the heat like wrath conceald in love’s face, or the seed, eris in eros, key and lock of what i was?      i could not speak the releasing word.      for into a dark matter he came and askt me to say what i could not say.      “i ..”  all the flame in me stopt against my tongue. my heart was a stone, a dumb unmanageable thing in me, a darkness that stood athwart his need for the enlightening, the “i love you” that has only this one quick in time, this one start when its moment is true.  such is the sickness of many a good thing that now into my life from long ago this refusing to say i love you has bound the weeping, the yielding, the yearning to be taken again, into a knot, a waiting, a string  so taut it taunts the song, it resists the touch. it grows dark to draw down the lover’s hand from its lightness to what’s underground.  
NEW POEM
 i was sitting in old town square with tourists and birds and i was reading foucault, how “he who is subjected to a field of visibility ... becomes the principle of his own subjection” and all around me the beautiful czechoslovakian boys moved through the first day of spring like perennially visible inmates in the opening credits of a prison porno. the sun reflected off the glass and my table was an inscrutable tower of light from which i peered, invisibly, at the swan-graceful boys who seemed to skirr across the stones, traveling, it seemed, to something vaguely ridiculous and charmingly anachronistic: cuff link shopping, or brunch with the duchess. the coffee had made me jittery and i was beginning to sweat from both sun and desire. i considered moving to the outer edge of the circled tables, so the boys could see me as i could see them, but then the 600-year-old orloj sounded the hour and the twelve apostles and skeletal death spun around and i was afraid to leave my tower. i didn’t want to be visible in the way those small dancing figures were visible and as much as i wanted a handsome companion, i feared my foot getting caught in a sewer grate or my spoon falling from my saucer and clattering on the pavement, startling the birds into a ruckus. an errant ball of sweat fell from my chin and onto the page. i looked down to where it had landed on the word “reciprocal” which made me think how looking is always reducible to twos — two eyes, two parties, two possible outcomes, and how those who watch from the panopticon’s black pupil may, in any case, not even exist.  
NEW POEM
 my father at the dictionary-stand touches the page to fully understand the lamplit answer, tilting in his hand  his slowly scanning magnifying lens, a blurry, glistening circle he suspends above the word “carnation.” then he bends  so near his eyes are magnified and blurred, one finger on the miniature word, as if he touched a single key and heard  a distant, plucked, infinitesimal string, “the obligation due to every thing that’s smaller than the universe.” i bring  my sewing needle close enough that i can watch my father through the needle’s eye, as through a lens ground for a butterfly  who peers down flower-hallways toward a room shadowed and fathomed as this study’s gloom where, as a scholar bends above a tomb  to read what’s buried there, he bends to pore over the latin blossom. i am four, i spill my pins and needles on the floor  trying to stitch “beloved” x by x. my dangerous, bright needle’s point connects myself illiterate to this perfect text  i cannot read. my father puzzles why it is my habit to identify carnations as “christ’s flowers,” knowing i  can give no explanation but “because.” word-roots blossom in speechless messages the way the thread behind my sampler does  where following each x i awkward move my needle through the word whose root is love. he reads, “a pink variety of clove,  carnatio, the latin, meaning flesh.” as if the bud’s essential oils brush christ’s fragrance through the room, the iron-fresh  odor carnations have floats up to me, a drifted, secret, bitter ecstasy, the stems squeak in my scissors,child, it’s me,  he turns the page to “clove” and reads aloud: “the clove, a spice, dried from a flower-bud.” then twice, as if he hasn't understood,  he reads, “from french, for clou, meaning a nail.” he gazes, motionless. “meaning a nail.” the incarnation blossoms, flesh and nail,  i twist my threads like stems into a knot and smooth “beloved,” but my needle caught within the threads,thy blood so dearly bought,  the needle strikes my finger to the bone. i lift my hand, it is myself i’ve sewn, the flesh laid bare, the threads of blood my own,  i lift my hand in startled agony and call upon his name, “daddy daddy”— my father’s hand touches the injury  as lightly as he touched the page before, where incarnation bloomed from roots that bore the flowers i called christ’s when i was four.  
NEW POEM
 my brother, in his small white bed, held one end. i tugged the other to signal i was still awake. we could have spoken, could have sung to one another, we were in the same room for five years, but the soft cord with its little frayed ends connected us in the dark, gave comfort even if we had been bickering all day. when he fell asleep first and his end of the cord dropped to the floor, i missed him terribly, though i could hear his even breath and we had such long and separate lives ahead.

 selvakumar had waked too often to the shouts of dogs — come home too many times to an empty chicken coop, stray feathers where dinner was supposed to roost.   finding two dogs in his house one night, he slammed his door to trap them, gathered stones and — the flinging done — gibbeted the bodies from a tree.   a week later, he woke in darkness, feeling himself swept down a black, stinking hole the way in kansas city, missouri, inspector daniel collins, smacked by a surge  of sewer-water, slipped from his safety line and clattered down a 28-inch pipe dark as the grave it seemed about to be. waking from sound sleep that morning,   wolfing a breakfast of high-fiber toast and raisin bran, dan never dreamed a real nightmare would swallow him. selvakumar — squeezed by his nightmare —  screamed. one ear was deaf; both hands were numb; his legs, too weak to hold his weight, tongue lolling like a dead fish in his mouth the way dan’s did   as liquid filth shoved his head under, while — first thrashing and battering, then not — he rolled/banged/slithered through earth’s bowels in darkness worse  than what seized irmgard holm’s left eye when, after cataract surgery, she groped for eye drops in the night, grabbed a super glue tube, and sealed her lid tight.   doctors took selvakumar’s cash, and shook their heads. a village healer diagnosed, “the dogs cursed you.” to break the curse, friends caught a stray, named her selvi —  repentance — wrapped her in an orange sari, and hung a purple garland on her neck. selvakumar — all in white, but for a purple garland like his bride’s — felt his dead   legs quiver as she edged toward him. even as he pledged eternal love, he planned to wed a woman when his health returned. unlike a two-legged wife, though, selvi didn’t  hound him about the marital act, didn’t demand a better sari or a bigger home, or nag as he grew more helpless every day. easy to laugh, invoking brad &amp; angelina,   pyramus &amp; thisbe. still, on the night selvakumar found himself rushing again down the dark hole, who can say that selvi didn’t guide him — as irmgard’s husband  led her to the doctor who dissolved the glue and saved her eye — as daniel’s cries led rescuers to him, twelve feet underground, two miles from where he began —   as the son of marjorie potts gaffrey (dead in her sleep at 99), by sprinkling his mother’s ashes in her favorite flower pot, led marjorie to wake as an african violet,  sun bright on her leaves as it was in daniel’s and irmgard’s eyes, the dew of morning like the feel, as selvakumar lay dying in his bed, of selvi’s tongue.  
NEW POEM
 most of the past is lost, and i’m glad mine has vanished into blackness or space or whatever nowhere what we feel and do goes, but there were a few cool sunday afternoons when my father wasn’t sick with hangover and the air in the house wasn’t foul with anger and the best china had been cleared after the week’s best meal so he could place on the table his violins to polish with their special cloth and oil. three violins he’d arrange side by side in their velvet-lined cases with enough room between for the lids to lie open. they looked like children in coffins, three infant sisters whose hearts had stopped for no reason, but after he rubbed up their scrolls and waists along the lines of the grain to the highest sheen, they took on the knowing postures of women in silk gowns in magazine ads for new cars and ocean voyages, and, as if a violin were a car in storage that needed a spin around the block every so often, for fifteen minutes he’d play each one— though not until each horsehair bow was precisely tightened, and coated with rosin, and we had undergone an eon of tuning. when he played, no one was allowed to speak to him. he seemed to see something drastic across the room or feel it through his handkerchief padding the chin board. so we’d hop in front of him waving or making pig noses the way kids do to guards at buckingham palace, and after he had finished playing and had returned to himself, he’d softly curse the idiocy of his children beneath my mother’s voice yelling to him from the kitchen that was beautiful, paul, play it again. he never did, and i always hoped he wouldn’t, because the whole time i was waiting for his switchblade to appear, and the new stories he’d tell me for the scar thin as a seam up the white underside of his forearm, for the chunks of proud flesh on his back and belly, scarlet souvenirs of east st. louis dance halls in the twenties, cornered in men’s rooms, ganged in blind alleys, always slashing out alone with this knife. first the violins had to be snug again inside their black cases for who knew how many more months or years or lifetimes; then he had to pretend to have forgotten why i was sitting there wide-eyed across from him long after my sister and brother had gone off with friends. every time, as if only an afterthought, he’d sneak into his pocket and ease the switchblade onto the bare table between us, its thumb-button jutting from the pearl-and-silver plating like the eye of some sleek prehistoric fish. i must have known it wouldn’t come to life and slither toward me by itself, but when he’d finally nod to me to take it its touch was still warm with his body heat and i could feel the blade inside aching to flash open with the terrible click that sounds now like just a tsk of disappointment, it has become so sweet and quiet.  
NEW POEM
 castaways, we hit the forest — our camping stove turned low, i gripped my tent close for its trial in virgin attitudes of stiffness while lamps fluttered on the dark. my roof sank wave on wave accordion-like, the only sin we knew; and soon the jameson appeared. i’d burned one back and by the third she laid her hand on mine, like a napkin ...  later, i caught those tiny gasps from joan and michael’s tent where he slipped into her like (this i thought) a frog à la bashō; those dark rippling walls where she kept center, held her breath, so i had to puzzle how one could leave and neither be alone.

 we practiced together, sweat and stained. we pummeled each other and laughed off pain. teams may disagree, may tease, may blame. teams may bicker and whine, but get down for the game.  you had my back. we fought the fight. and though our score was less last night, we're walking tall. our team came through and stuck together like crazy glue. i'm proud to say i lost with you.

 you might as well take a razor to your pecker as let a woman in your heart. first they do the wash and then they kill you. they flash their lights and teach your wallet to puke. they bring it to you folded—if you see her stepping between the coin laundry and your building over the slushy street and watch the clothing steam, you can’t wait to open up the door when she puts the stairs behind her and catch that warmth between you. it changes into a baby. “here’s to the little shitter, the little linoleum lizard.” once he peed on me when i was changing him—that one got a laugh from the characters i wasted all my chances with at popeye’s establishment when it was over by the wonderland. but it’s destroyed now and i understand one of those shopping malls that are like great monuments of blindness and folly stands there. and next door, the grimy restaurants of men with movies where they used to wear human faces, the sad people from space. but that was never me, because everything in those days depended on my work. “listen, i’m going to work,” was all i could say, and drunk or sober i would put on the uniform of texaco and wade into my life. i felt like a man of honor and substance, but the situation was dancing underneath me— once i walked into the living room at my sister’s and saw that the two of them, her and my sister, had turned sometime behind my back not exactly fatter, but heavy, or squalid, with cartoons moving across the television in front of them, surrounded by laundry, and a couple of coca-colas standing up next to the iron on the board. i stepped out into the yard of bricks and trash and watched the light light up the blood inside each leaf, and i asked myself, now what is the rpm on this mother? where do you turn it on? i think you understand how i felt. i’m not saying everything changed in the space of one second of seeing two women, but i did start dragging her into the clubs with me. i insisted she be sexy. i just wanted to live. and i did: some nights were so sensory i felt the starlight landing on my back and i believed i could set fire to things with my fingers— but the strategies of others broke my promise. at closing time once, she kept talking to a man when i was trying to catch her attention to leave. it was a negro man, and i thought of black limousines and black masses and black hydrants filled with black water. when the lights came on you could see all kinds of intentions in the air. i thought i might smack her face, or spill a glass, but instead i opened him up with my red fishing knife and i took out his guts and i said, “here they are, motherfucker, nigger, here they are.” there were people frozen around us. the lights had just come on. at that moment i saw her reading me and reading me from the end of the world where i saw her standing, and the way the sacred light played across her face all i can tell you is i had to be a diamond of ice to manage. right down the middle from beginning to end my life pours into one ocean: into this prison with its empty ballfield and its empty preparations for never happen. if she ever comes to visit me, to hell with her, i won’t talk to her, and my son can entertain himself. god kill them both. i’m sorry for nothing. i’m just an alien from another planet. i am not happy. disappointment lights its stupid fire in my heart, but two days a week i staff the max security laundry above the world on the seventh level, looking at two long roads out there that go to a couple of towns. young girls accelerating through the intersection make me want to live forever, they make me think of the grand things, of wars and extremely white, quiet light that never dies. sometimes i stand against the window for hours tuned to every station at once, so loaded on crystal meth i believe i’ll drift out of my body. jesus christ, your doors close and open, you touch the maniac drifters, the fireaters, i could say a million things about you and never get that silence out of time that happens when the blank muscle hangs between its beats—that is what i mean by darkness, the place where i kiss your mouth, where nothing bad has happened. i’m not anyone but i wish i could be told when you will come to save us. i have written several poems and several hymns, and one has been performed on the religious ultrahigh frequency station. and it goes like this.  
NEW POEM
 for some semitropical reason when the rains fall relentlessly they fall  into swimming pools, these otherwise bright and scary arachnids. they can swim a little, but not for long  and they can’t climb the ladder out. they usually drown—but if you want their favor, if you believe there is justice, a reward for not loving  the death of ugly and even dangerous (the eel, hog snake, rats) creatures, if  you believe these things, then you would leave a lifebuoy or two in your swimming pool at night.  and in the morning you would haul ashore the huddled, hairy survivors  and escort them back to the bush, and know, be assured that at least these saved, as individuals, would not turn up  again someday in your hat, drawer, or the tangled underworld  of your socks, and that even— when your belief in justice merges with your belief in dreams— they may tell the others  in a sign language four times as subtle and complicated as man’s  that you are good, that you love them, that you would save them again.

 all of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost nothing else mattered but to learn some new trick, to pull off something we saw in a skate video, wind cutting around our bodies when we flew off the lip of a ramp, grabbed the board and twisted into a 180, kicking a leg out and landing it, the only way to run through the neighborhood  was to run through it together, flipping off cops and skinheads, i almost don't even remember girls but a vague sense of the taste of bubble gum and how they smelled so different from us, sitting in some kid's basement drinking his parents' vodka, we grew out our bangs, moved in a pack, jumped in when some one of us got jumped,  so when a man we had never seen before came up and started beating on simon, one of us dropped his skateboard, walked over to the man like someone walking into a bank and stabbed him. the man, startled, sat down, right there on the asphalt, right in the middle of his new consciousness, kind of looking around.

 i am a slave to the nudity of women. i do not know with what resolve  i could stand against it, a naked woman asking of me anything.  an unclothed woman is sometimes other things. i see her in a dish of green pears.  anselmo, do you know what i mean if i say without clothes  her breasts are the two lions in front of the new york public library,  do you know that postcard of mine? in those lions there is something  for which i have in exchange only sounds. only my fingers.  i see her everywhere. she is the lions and the pears, those letters of the alphabet  as children we called dirty, the w, the y, the small o.  she is absolutely the wet clothing on the line. or, you know, to be more intimate,  may i? the nub, the nose of the pear, do you know what i mean? those parts of the woman  i will call two spanish dancer hats, or rounder sometimes, doughboy helmets from the war.  sometimes they are flat in the late afternoon asleep. like drawings,  like a single rock thrown into the lake, these parts of a woman an imperfect circling  gyre of lines moving out, beyond the water. they reach me at the shore, anselmo.  without fail, they are stronger, and they have always been faster than i am.  it’s like watching the lassoing man, the man with the perfectly circling rope,  pedro armendariz in the mexican movies, or will rogers. wherever one is from,  whoever this man is. and he is always there. everybody knows one.  he always makes his big lasso, twirling his rope around himself and a woman from the audience  only i am the woman, do you understand, anselmo? caught in the circling rope. i am the woman  and me thinking of a woman without clothes  is that man and that rope and we are riding on separate horses.

 gettin’ together to smile an’ rejoice, an’ eatin’ an’ laughin’ with folks of your choice; an’ kissin’ the girls an’ declarin’ that they are growin’ more beautiful day after day; chattin’ an’ braggin’ a bit with the men, buildin’ the old family circle again; livin’ the wholesome an’ old-fashioned cheer, just for awhile at the end of the year.  greetings fly fast as we crowd through the door and under the old roof we gather once more just as we did when the youngsters were small; mother’s a little bit grayer, that’s all. father’s a little bit older, but still ready to romp an’ to laugh with a will. here we are back at the table again tellin’ our stories as women an’ men.  bowed are our heads for a moment in prayer; oh, but we’re grateful an’ glad to be there. home from the east land an’ home from the west, home with the folks that are dearest an’ best. out of the sham of the cities afar we’ve come for a time to be just what we are. here we can talk of ourselves an’ be frank, forgettin’ position an’ station an’ rank.  give me the end of the year an’ its fun when most of the plannin’ an’ toilin’ is done; bring all the wanderers home to the nest, let me sit down with the ones i love best, hear the old voices still ringin’ with song, see the old faces unblemished by wrong, see the old table with all of its chairs an’ i’ll put soul in my thanksgivin’ prayers.

 butch once remarked to me how sinister it was alone, after hours, in the dark of the shop to find me there hunched over two weeks’ accounts probably smoked like a bacon from all those pall-malls.  odd comfort when the light goes, the case lights left on and the rings of baloney, the herring, the parsley, arranged in the strict, familiar ways.  whatever intactness holds animals up has been carefully taken, what’s left are the parts. just look in the cases, all counted and stacked.  step-and-a-half waleski used to come to the shop and ask for the cheap cut, she would thump, sniff, and finger. this one too old. this one here for my supper. two days and you do notice change in the texture.  i have seen them the day before slaughter. knowing the outcome from the moment they enter the chute, the eye rolls, blood is smeared on the lintel. mallet or bullet they lunge toward their darkness.  but something queer happens when the heart is delivered. when a child is born, sometimes the left hand is stronger. you can train it to fail, still the knowledge is there. that is the knowledge in the hand of a butcher  that adds to its weight. otto kröger could fell a dray horse with one well-placed punch to the jaw, and yet it is well known how thorough he was.  he never sat down without washing his hands, and he was a maker, his sausage was echt so that even waleski had little complaint. butch once remarked there was no one so deft as my otto. so true, there is great tact involved in parting the flesh from the bones that it loves.  how we cling to the bones. each joint is a web of small tendons and fibers. he knew what i meant when i told him i felt something pull from the left, and how often it clouded the day before slaughter.  something queer happens when the heart is delivered.

 once we were in the loop . . . slick with information and the luster of good timing. we folded our clothes. once we stood up before the standing vigils,before the popping vats,before the annotated lists of marshaled forces with their venn diagrams like anxious zygotes, their paratactic chasms . . .before the set of whirligig blades, modular torrent. we folded our clothes. once we remembered to get up to pee . . . and how to pee in a gleaming bowl . . . soaked as we were in gin and coconut, licorice water with catalpa buds, golden beet syrup in johnny walker blue and a beautiful blur like august fog, cantilevered over the headlands . . . we tucked into the crevices of the mattress pad twirling our auburn braids, or woke up at the nick of light and practiced folding our clothes. our pod printed headbands with hourly updates, announcing the traversals of green-shouldered hawks through the downtown loop, of gillyfish threading the north canals, of the discovery of electron calligraphy or a new method of washing brine. we smoothed our feathers like birds do, and twitched ourselves into warm heaps, and followed the fourth hand on the platinum clocks sweeping in arcs from left to right, up and down, in and out . . . we were steeped in watchfulness, fully suspended, itinerant floaters — ocean of air — among  the ozone lily pads and imbrex domes, the busting thickets of nutmeg, and geode malls. at night we told stories about the future with clairvoyant certainty. our clothing was spectacular and fit to a t. we admired each other with ferocity.  
NEW POEM
 joy in the day's being done, however clumsily, and in the ticked-off lists, the packages nestling together, no one home waiting for dinner, for you, no one impatient for your touch or kind words to salve what nightly rises like heartburn, the ghost-lump feeling that one is really as alone as one had feared. one isn't, not really. not really. joy to see over the strip mall darkening right on schedule a neon-proof pink sunset flaring like the roof of a cat's mouth, cleanly ribbed, the clouds laddering up and lit as if by a match struck somewhere in the throat much deeper down.

 there is a garden in her face where roses and white lilies grow; a heav'nly paradise is that place wherein all pleasant fruits do flow. there cherries grow which none may buy, till "cherry ripe" themselves do cry.  those cherries fairly do enclose of orient pearl a double row, which when her lovely laughter shows, they look like rose-buds fill'd with snow; yet them nor peer nor prince can buy, till "cherry ripe" themselves do cry.  her eyes like angels watch them still, her brows like bended bows do stand, threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill all that attempt with eye or hand those sacred cherries to come nigh, till "cherry ripe" themselves do cry.

 they sit together on the porch, the dark almost fallen, the house behind them dark. their supper done with, they have washed and dried the dishes–only two plates now, two glasses, two knives, two forks, two spoons–small work for two. she sits with her hands folded in her lap, at rest. he smokes his pipe. they do not speak, and when they speak at last it is to say what each one knows the other knows. they have one mind between them, now, that finally for all its knowing will not exactly know which one goes first through the dark doorway, bidding goodnight, and which sits on a while alone.

 the thing written is a sexual thing, may bite, tell a truth some have died for, even the most casual initialing is a touch of love and what love goes for. a sometime thing, it smiles or has an ugly grin, on the page or wall may be holy and a sin. writing wants, must have, must know, is flesh, blood, and bone, proof we are not made to be alone. beneath a dove and rainbow some bank their fire, wrap their erogenous zones in barbed wire.  writing may dance in ink flamenco, kneel before the cross, right wrongs, fall in love at first sight, honor the naked languages it holds tight, kidnap, suck or be sucked for hire, may look and look or sneak a look, it has eyes, can read, is remarkable. from the tower of sexual babble, when dreams were the beginning of writing, the angel of dreams descended, stair by stair, the stone watchtower became the first stone book.  writing never speaks word, may ache to talk, and yet each letter of any alphabet is a fragment of desire, like half and quarter notes on a staff, or a hawk, may swoop down, fly higher and higher to catch a word, and then another word. the sexual thing may be all love or malice, eunuchs writing in the forbidden palace where poets dressed in rags, or silk and lace. the thing written touches, kisses, cuddles,  may be democratic, autocratic, medieval in the 21st century, feudal, imperial, animal, sexually digital, a serf, a king, a queen, la chose écrite est une chose sexuelle. i had a woman beautiful as the letter l . there is the passion of letters, each may mean another thing, be defaced, after a while. writing leans forward, there is a certain optimism in the written word, a sexual sunrise that is not daybreak. words, words, a carnival of wordplay on st. nobody’s day. reader, look, there is an s, a snake on the cross of the letter t. the letter of love is still the open-legged v. how can i dot the i with humanity?

 “your great-grandfather was . . .”  and mrs. c, our tart old scots landlady, with her stomping legs, four bristles sprouted from her chin- wart, she who briskly chats away about montrose, founder of her clan, as though she’s just now fresh from tea with him, regards you incredulously, a bastard gargoyle off some bastard architecture, one grown topsy-turvy: “not to know your great-grandfather! how do you live? o you americans!” she cannot see what freedom it affords, your ignorance, a space swept clear of all the clutter of lives lived. and yet who can dismiss her words entirely? it burdens too, this emptiness, pervasive presence not a room away that, no matter how you hammer at its wall, refuses to admit you. as though you woke and in a place you thought familiar, then had a sense (what is it that has been disturbed?) of one you never met yet somehow knew—looks echoing among the dusty pictures: that myopic glass reflecting, like a sunset lingered inside trees, a meditative smile: a breath warm to your cheek, your brow: the hand (whose?) moving on your blanket in a gesture that you fail to recognize  yet know it as you know the taste through oranges of sun- light current in them still—  then gone as you began to stir. and for a moment dawn seems lost as in a mist, seems wistful  for a feeling it cannot achieve . . . the sun breaks through, an instant medleying the leaves.

 —for dioniso d. martínez take detroit, where boys are manufactured into men, where you learn to think in american. you speak to no one unless someone speaks to you. everyone is suspect: baldheaded carriers from the post office; old polish ladies who swear to jesus, joseph, and mary; your brother, especially your brother, waiting in a long line for work. there’s always a flip side. no matter what happens, tomorrow is a day away, or a gin bottle if you can’t sleep, and if you stopped drinking, a pack of cigarettes. after that, you’re on your own, you pack up and leave. you still call the city beside the strait home. make no mistake, it’s miserable. after all, you bought a one-way greyhound ticket, cursed each and every pothole on the road out. but that’s where you stood before a  mirror in the dark, where you were too tired to complain. you never go back. things could be worse. maybe. detroit is a shithole, it’s where you were pulled from the womb into the streets. listen, when i say detroit, i mean any place. by thinking american, i mean made.

 tonight my brother, in heavy boots, is walking through bare rooms over my head, opening and closing doors. what could he be looking for in an empty house? what could he possibly need there in heaven? does he remember his earth, his birthplace set to torches? his love for me feels like spilled water running back to its vessel.  at this hour, what is dead is restless and what is living is burning.  someone tell him he should sleep now.  my father keeps a light on by our bed and readies for our journey. he mends ten holes in the knees of five pairs of boy’s pants. his love for me is like his sewing: various colors and too much thread, the stitching uneven. but the needle pierces clean through with each stroke of his hand.  at this hour, what is dead is worried and what is living is fugitive.  someone tell him he should sleep now.  god, that old furnace, keeps talking with his mouth of teeth, a beard stained at feasts, and his breath of gasoline, airplane, human ash. his love for me feels like fire, feels like doves, feels like river-water.  at this hour, what is dead is helpless, kind and helpless. while the lord lives.  someone tell the lord to leave me alone. i’ve had enough of his love that feels like burning and flight and running away.

 [addressed to charles lamb, of the india house, london] well, they are gone, and here must i remain, this lime-tree bower my prison! i have lost beauties and feelings, such as would have been most sweet to my remembrance even when age had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! they, meanwhile, friends, whom i never more may meet again, on springy heath, along the hill-top edge, wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance, to that still roaring dell, of which i told; the roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep, and only speckled by the mid-day sun; where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock flings arching like a bridge;—that branchless ash, unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still, fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends behold the dark green file of long lank weeds, that all at once (a most fantastic sight!) still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge of the blue clay-stone.  now, my friends emerge beneath the wide wide heaven—and view again the many-steepled tract magnificent of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea, with some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up the slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two isles of purple shadow! yes! they wander on in gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad, my gentle-hearted charles! for thou hast pined and hunger'd after nature, many a year, in the great city pent, winning thy way with sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain and strange calamity! ah! slowly sink behind the western ridge, thou glorious sun! shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb, ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds! live in the yellow light, ye distant groves! and kindle, thou blue ocean! so my friend struck with deep joy may stand, as i have stood, silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round on the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem less gross than bodily; and of such hues as veil the almighty spirit, when yet he makes spirits perceive his presence.  a delight comes sudden on my heart, and i am glad as i myself were there! nor in this bower, this little lime-tree bower, have i not mark'd much that has sooth'd me. pale beneath the blaze hung the transparent foliage; and i watch'd some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see the shadow of the leaf and stem above dappling its sunshine! and that walnut-tree was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay full on the ancient ivy, which usurps those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue through the late twilight: and though now the bat wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters, yet still the solitary humble-bee sings in the bean-flower! henceforth i shall know that nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure; no plot so narrow, be but nature there, no waste so vacant, but may well employ each faculty of sense, and keep the heart awake to love and beauty! and sometimes 'tis well to be bereft of promis'd good, that we may lift the soul, and contemplate with lively joy the joys we cannot share. my gentle-hearted charles! when the last rook beat its straight path along the dusky air homewards, i blest it! deeming its black wing (now a dim speck, now vanishing in light) had cross'd the mighty orb's dilated glory, while thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still, flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm for thee, my gentle-hearted charles, to whom no sound is dissonant which tells of life.

 to beat the froggiest of morning voices, my son gets out of bed and takes a lumpish song along—a little lyric learned in kindergarten, something about a boat. he’s found it in the bog of his throat before his feet have hit the ground, follows its wonky melody down the hall and into the loo as if it were the most natural thing for a little boy to do, and lets it loose awhile in there to a tinkling sound while i lie still in bed, alive like i’ve never been, in love again with life, afraid they’ll find me drowned here, drowned in more than my fair share of joy.

NEW POEM
 i “there is a thorn—it looks so old, in truth, you’d find it hard to say how it could ever have been young, it looks so old and grey. not higher than a two years' child it stands erect, this aged thorn; no leaves it has, no prickly points; it is a mass of knotted joints, a wretched thing forlorn. it stands erect, and like a stone with lichens is it overgrown.  ii “like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown, with lichens to the very top, and hung with heavy tufts of moss, a melancholy crop: up from the earth these mosses creep, and this poor thorn they clasp it round so close, you’d say that they are bent with plain and manifest intent to drag it to the ground; and all have joined in one endeavour to bury this poor thorn for ever.  iii “high on a mountain’s highest ridge, where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds it sweeps from vale to vale; not five yards from the mountain path, this thorn you on your left espy; and to the left, three yards beyond, you see a little muddy pond of water—never dry, though but of compass small, and bare to thirsty suns and parching air.  iv “and, close beside this aged thorn, there is a fresh and lovely sight, a beauteous heap, a hill of moss, just half a foot in height. all lovely colours there you see, all colours that were ever seen; and mossy network too is there, as if by hand of lady fair the work had woven been; and cups, the darlings of the eye, so deep is their vermilion dye.  v “ah me! what lovely tints are there of olive green and scarlet bright, in spikes, in branches, and in stars, green, red, and pearly white! this heap of earth o’ergrown with moss, which close beside the thorn you see, so fresh in all its beauteous dyes, is like an infant’s grave in size, as like as like can be: but never, never any where, an infant’s grave was half so fair.  vi “now would you see this aged thorn, this pond, and beauteous hill of moss, you must take care and choose your time the mountain when to cross. for oft there sits between the heap, so like an infant’s grave in size, and that same pond of which i spoke, a woman in a scarlet cloak, and to herself she cries, ‘oh misery! oh misery! oh woe is me! oh misery!’  vii “at all times of the day and night this wretched woman thither goes; and she is known to every star, and every wind that blows; and there, beside the thorn, she sits when the blue daylight’s in the skies, and when the whirlwind’s on the hill, or frosty air is keen and still, and to herself she cries, ‘oh misery! oh misery! oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”  viii “now wherefore, thus, by day and night, in rain, in tempest, and in snow, thus to the dreary mountain-top does this poor woman go? and why sits she beside the thorn when the blue daylight’s in the sky or when the whirlwind’s on the hill, or frosty air is keen and still, and wherefore does she cry?— o wherefore? wherefore? tell me why does she repeat that doleful cry?”  ix “i cannot tell; i wish i could; for the true reason no one knows: but would you gladly view the spot, the spot to which she goes; the hillock like an infant’s grave, the pond—and thorn, so old and grey; pass by her door—’tis seldom shut— and if you see her in her hut— then to the spot away! i never heard of such as dare approach the spot when she is there.”  x “but wherefore to the mountain-top can this unhappy woman go, whatever star is in the skies, whatever wind may blow?” “full twenty years are past and gone since she (her name is martha ray) gave with a maiden’s true good-will her company to stephen hill; and she was blithe and gay, while friends and kindred all approved of him whom tenderly she loved.  xi “and they had fixed the wedding day, the morning that must wed them both; but stephen to another maid had sworn another oath; and, with this other maid, to church unthinking stephen went— poor martha! on that woeful day a pang of pitiless dismay into her soul was sent; a fire was kindled in her breast, which might not burn itself to rest.  xii “they say, full six months after this, while yet the summer leaves were green, she to the mountain-top would go, and there was often seen. what could she seek?—or wish to hide? her state to any eye was plain; she was with child, and she was mad; yet often was she sober sad from her exceeding pain. o guilty father—would that death had saved him from that breach of faith!  xiii “sad case for such a brain to hold communion with a stirring child! sad case, as you may think, for one who had a brain so wild! last christmas-eve we talked of this, and grey-haired wilfred of the glen held that the unborn infant wrought about its mother’s heart, and brought her senses back again: and, when at last her time drew near, her looks were calm, her senses clear.  xiv “more know i not, i wish i did, and it should all be told to you; for what became of this poor child no mortal ever knew; nay—if a child to her was born no earthly tongue could ever tell; and if ’twas born alive or dead, far less could this with proof be said; but some remember well, that martha ray about this time would up the mountain often climb.  xv “and all that winter, when at night the wind blew from the mountain-peak, ’twas worth your while, though in the dark, the churchyard path to seek: for many a time and oft were heard cries coming from the mountain head: some plainly living voices were; and others, i’ve heard many swear, were voices of the dead: i cannot think, whate’er they say, they had to do with martha ray.  xvi “but that she goes to this old thorn, the thorn which i described to you, and there sits in a scarlet cloak, i will be sworn is true. for one day with my telescope, to view the ocean wide and bright, when to this country first i came, ere i had heard of martha’s name, i climbed the mountain’s height:— a storm came on, and i could see no object higher than my knee.  xvii “ ’twas mist and rain, and storm and rain: no screen, no fence could i discover; and then the wind! in sooth, it was a wind full ten times over. i looked around, i thought i saw a jutting crag,—and off i ran, head-foremost, through the driving rain, the shelter of the crag to gain; and, as i am a man, instead of jutting crag, i found a woman seated on the ground.  xviii “i did not speak—i saw her face; her face!—it was enough for me; i turned about and heard her cry, ‘oh misery! oh misery!’ and there she sits, until the moon through half the clear blue sky will go; and when the little breezes make the waters of the pond to shake, as all the country know, she shudders, and you hear her cry, ‘oh misery! oh misery!’ ”  xix “but what’s the thorn? and what the pond? and what the hill of moss to her? and what the creeping breeze that comes the little pond to stir?” “i cannot tell; but some will say she hanged her baby on the tree; some say she drowned it in the pond, which is a little step beyond: but all and each agree, the little babe was buried there, beneath that hill of moss so fair.  xx “i’ve heard, the moss is spotted red with drops of that poor infant’s blood; but kill a new-born infant thus, i do not think she could! some say, if to the pond you go, and fix on it a steady view, the shadow of a babe you trace, a baby and a baby’s face, and that it looks at you; whene’er you look on it, ’tis plain the baby looks at you again.  xxi “and some had sworn an oath that she should be to public justice brought; and for the little infant’s bones with spades they would have sought. but instantly the hill of moss before their eyes began to stir! and, for full fifty yards around, the grass—it shook upon the ground! yet all do still aver the little babe lies buried there, beneath that hill of moss so fair.  xxii “i cannot tell how this may be, but plain it is the thorn is bound with heavy tufts of moss that strive to drag it to the ground; and this i know, full many a time, when she was on the mountain high, by day, and in the silent night, when all the stars shone clear and bright, that i have heard her cry, ‘oh misery! oh misery! oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”

 there, robert, you have kill'd that fly — , and should you thousand ages try the life you've taken to supply, you could not do it.  you surely must have been devoid of thought and sense, to have destroy'd a thing which no way you annoy'd — you'll one day rue it.  twas but a fly perhaps you'll say, that's born in april, dies in may; that does but just learn to display his wings one minute,  and in the next is vanish'd quite. a bird devours it in his flight — or come a cold blast in the night, there's no breath in it.  the bird but seeks his proper food — and providence, whose power endu'd that fly with life, when it thinks good, may justly take it.  but you have no excuses for't — a life by nature made so short, less reason is that you for sport should shorter make it.  a fly a little thing you rate — but, robert do not estimate a creature's pain by small or great; the greatest being  can have but fibres, nerves, and flesh, and these the smallest ones possess, although their frame and structure less escape our seeing.

 how changed is here each spot man makes or fills! in the two hinkseys nothing keeps the same; the village street its haunted mansion lacks, and from the sign is gone sibylla's name, and from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks— are ye too changed, ye hills? see, 'tis no foot of unfamiliar men to-night from oxford up your pathway strays! here came i often, often, in old days— thyrsis and i; we still had thyrsis then.  runs it not here, the track by childsworth farm, past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns the hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames? the signal-elm, that looks on ilsley downs, the vale, the three lone weirs, the youthful thames?— this winter-eve is warm, humid the air! leafless, yet soft as spring, the tender purple spray on copse and briers! and that sweet city with her dreaming spires, she needs not june for beauty's heightening,  lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!— only, methinks, some loss of habit's power befalls me wandering through this upland dim. once pass'd i blindfold here, at any hour; now seldom come i, since i came with him. that single elm-tree bright against the west—i miss it! is it goner? we prized it dearly; while it stood, we said, our friend, the gipsy-scholar, was not dead; while the tree lived, he in these fields lived on.  too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here, but once i knew each field, each flower, each stick; and with the country-folk acquaintance made by barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick. here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assay'd. ah me! this many a year my pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday! needs must i lose them, needs with heavy heart into the world and wave of men depart; but thyrsis of his own will went away.  it irk'd him to be here, he could not rest. he loved each simple joy the country yields, he loved his mates; but yet he could not keep, for that a shadow lour'd on the fields, here with the shepherds and the silly sheep. some life of men unblest he knew, which made him droop, and fill'd his head. he went; his piping took a troubled sound of storms that rage outside our happy ground; he could not wait their passing, he is dead.  so, some tempestuous morn in early june, when the year's primal burst of bloom is o'er, before the roses and the longest day— when garden-walks and all the grassy floor with blossoms red and white of fallen may and chestnut-flowers are strewn— so have i heard the cuckoo's parting cry, from the wet field, through the vext garden-trees, come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze: the bloom is gone, and with the bloom go i!   too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go? soon will the high midsummer pomps come on, soon will the musk carnations break and swell, soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon, sweet-william with his homely cottage-smell, and stocks in fragrant blow; roses that down the alleys shine afar, and open, jasmine-muffled lattices, and groups under the dreaming garden-trees, and the full moon, and the white evening-star.  he hearkens not! light comer, he is flown! what matters it? next year he will return, and we shall have him in the sweet spring-days, with whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern, and blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways, and scent of hay new-mown. but thyrsis never more we swains shall see; see him come back, and cut a smoother reed, and blow a strain the world at last shall heed— for time, not corydon, hath conquer'd thee!  alack, for corydon no rival now!— but when sicilian shepherds lost a mate, some good survivor with his flute would go, piping a ditty sad for bion's fate; and cross the unpermitted ferry's flow, and relax pluto's brow, and make leap up with joy the beauteous head of proserpine, among whose crowned hair are flowers first open'd on sicilian air, and flute his friend, like orpheus, from the dead.  o easy access to the hearer's grace when dorian shepherds sang to proserpine! for she herself had trod sicilian fields, she knew the dorian water's gush divine, she knew each lily white which enna yields each rose with blushing face; she loved the dorian pipe, the dorian strain. but ah, of our poor thames she never heard! her foot the cumner cowslips never stirr'd; and we should tease her with our plaint in vain!  well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be, yet, thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour in the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd hill! who, if not i, for questing here hath power? i know the wood which hides the daffodil, i know the fyfield tree, i know what white, what purple fritillaries the grassy harvest of the river-fields, above by ensham, down by sandford, yields, and what sedged brooks are thames's tributaries;  i know these slopes; who knows them if not i?— but many a tingle on the loved hillside, with thorns once studded, old, white-blossom'd trees, where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried high tower'd the spikes of purple orchises, hath since our day put by the coronals of that forgotten time; down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy's team, and only in the hidden brookside gleam primroses, orphans of the flowery prime.  where is the girl, who by the boatman's door, above the locks, above the boating throng, unmoor'd our skiff when through the wytham flats, red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among and darting swallows and light water-gnats, we track'd the shy thames shore? where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell of our boat passing heaved the river-grass, stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?— they all are gone, and thou art gone as well!  yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night in ever-nearing circle weaves her shade. i see her veil draw soft across the day, i feel her slowly chilling breath invade the cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with grey; i feel her finger light laid pausefully upon life's headlong train; — the foot less prompt to meet the morning dew, the heart less bounding at emotion new, and hope, once crush'd, less quick to spring again.  and long the way appears, which seem'd so short to the less practised eye of sanguine youth; and high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air, the mountain-tops where is the throne of truth, tops in life's morning-sun so bright and bare! unbreachable the fort of the long-batter'd world uplifts its wall; and strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows, and near and real the charm of thy repose, and night as welcome as a friend would fall.  but hush! the upland hath a sudden loss of quiet!—look, adown the dusk hill-side, a troop of oxford hunters going home, as in old days, jovial and talking, ride! from hunting with the berkshire hounds they come. quick! let me fly, and cross into yon farther field!—'tis done; and see, back'd by the sunset, which doth glorify the orange and pale violet evening-sky, bare on its lonely ridge, the tree! the tree!  i take the omen! eve lets down her veil, the white fog creeps from bush to bush about, the west unflushes, the high stars grow bright, and in the scatter'd farms the lights come out. i cannot reach the signal-tree to-night, yet, happy omen, hail! hear it from thy broad lucent arno-vale (for there thine earth forgetting eyelids keep the morningless and unawakening sleep under the flowery oleanders pale),  hear it, o thyrsis, still our tree is there!— ah, vain! these english fields, this upland dim, these brambles pale with mist engarlanded, that lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him; to a boon southern country he is fled, and now in happier air, wandering with the great mother's train divine (and purer or more subtle soul than thee, i trow, the mighty mother doth not see) within a folding of the apennine,  thou hearest the immortal chants of old!— putting his sickle to the perilous grain in the hot cornfield of the phrygian king, for thee the lityerses-song again young daphnis with his silver voice doth sing; sings his sicilian fold, his sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes— and how a call celestial round him rang, and heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang, and all the marvel of the golden skies.  there thou art gone, and me thou leavest here sole in these fields! yet will i not despair. despair i will not, while i yet descry 'neath the mild canopy of english air that lonely tree against the western sky. still, still these slopes, 'tis clear, our gipsy-scholar haunts, outliving thee! fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay, woods with anemonies in flower till may, know him a wanderer still; then why not me?  a fugitive and gracious light he seeks, shy to illumine; and i seek it too. this does not come with houses or with gold, with place, with honour, and a flattering crew; 'tis not in the world's market bought and sold— but the smooth-slipping weeks drop by, and leave its seeker still untired; out of the heed of mortals he is gone, he wends unfollow'd, he must house alone; yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired.  thou too, o thyrsis, on like quest wast bound; thou wanderedst with me for a little hour! men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest, if men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee power, if men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest. and this rude cumner ground, its fir-topped hurst, its farms, its quiet fields, here cams't thou in thy jocund youthful time, here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime! and still the haunt beloved a virtue yields.  what though the music of thy rustic flute kept not for long its happy, country tone; lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note of men contention-tost, of men who groan, which task'd thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat— it fail'd, and thou wage mute! yet hadst thou always visions of our light, and long with men of care thou couldst not stay, and soon thy foot resumed its wandering way, left human haunt, and on alone till night.  too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here! 'mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore, thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home. —then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying roar, let in thy voice a whisper often come, to chase fatigue and fear: why faintest thou! i wander'd till i died.  roam on! the light we sought is shining still.  dost thou ask proof? our tree yet crowns the hill,  our scholar travels yet the loved hill-side.

 moringa of the flood bed on the banks of the river tigris.  a dove on a swaying bough's mournful cooing has turned me sad,  her song like the song of the queen of the gathering—  when she touches her triple chord you can forget the maestro brother of the caliph al-hádi!  and when she sings!—who was ánjash that camel driver with the mesmerizing chant, anyway?  in hadimát, sálma's direction, and sindád, i swear it,  i'm in love, far gone, with a girl who lives in ájyadi.  wrong, she lives in the obsidian black of the membrane of my liver.  through her, in a rush of musk and saffron, beauty falls into disarray.

 the problem— it’s not been written yet, the omens: the headless owl, the bobcat struck, the red wolf where she could not be.  none of it done and yet it’s over.  nothing yet of night     when she called me closer asked me to bring her crow painting to stay straight across from her feet so she could waken into it, remember her friend.  of old chief alongside her shoulder still watching over her just as the mountain had done throughout her alberta childhood.  the pendleton shroud bearing our braids, her figure in flaming pyre.  the cards, the notes, the tasks the things undone,     not done and she with us        faraway as this has always been    and ever will continue.  we meet we leave we meld and vaporize from whatever it was that held us human  in this life.  and all the beautiful things that lead our thoughts and give us reason remain despite the leaving and all i know         is what you know  when it is over said and done it was a time and there was never enough of it.

 sam paused on the stairs. he had forgotten a thing. in leland’s room a copy of thomas merton lay on the floor. the air was full of gnats of possibility. what was the story? sam looked at the clock twice. the day was dropping softly away while sam’s sneakers made the wood stairs creak. the wood was sure it was wood. alice got home from the store. the bags had to be unloaded as the day went and went. then the sundown kitchen grew quiet. sam crossed his legs one way, then the other way. he had chosen purple corduroys. they were pants of the day; one possibility. on the tilted table sat the damaged typewriter. what about thomas merton? did he know the central story? someone was quietly reading by the fireplace but not sam. next day there was badminton with the troubled carpenter and the story of an awful egg salad, causing laughter; but sam had forgotten some thing. then alice brought in the brownies and minor pleasure colored the house  and there went the evening. j.j. came downstairs all gleamy from her bath. she had three reasons to get downtown fast. sam picked up a novel by sukenick. the clue must be nearby. between sam and the page swarmed the gnats of possibility. leland stowed his bicycle in the basement and came upstairs with a point about capitalism. look at the time said someone. where was j.j. now? where was the story? under the red chair lay the newspaper whose relevance was all mystery or not mystery enough. then alice went out to see a movie. some man meets some woman with big eyes on a jet and changes his whole life for her, disastrously but thrillingly. alice told about it briefly, and went to make tea. sam paused on the hard wooden stairs. j.j. was gone. she was gone. leland was eating yogurt at midnight. the whole brown house was floating, gliding very smoothly for some reason with sam not clear whether the gliding was a story and if so was it central and was it his?

 love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it. camus all day my husband pounds on the upstairs porch. screeches and grunts of wood as the wall is opened keep the whole house tormented. he is trying to reach the bees, he is after bees. this is the climax, an end to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.  last june on the porch floor i found them dead, a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted, i swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch, i thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?  my life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. the search was hopeless. windows were shut. i never find where anything comes from. but in june my husband’s fierce sallies began, inspections, cracks located and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ course  watched, charted; books on bees read. i tell you i swept up bodies every day on the porch. then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again, as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech sleepers who live innocently in will and mind.  it is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers that the bees were back, no surprise to me. but they had left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs so deathly faded. gray bugs that the broom hunted were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch  of heart takes place, or a great shift of season. november it came to an end. no bees. and i could watch the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land. but this spring the thing began again, and his curse went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.  it is the man who takes hold. i lived from bees, but his force went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid. and now in july he is tearing out the wall, and each board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand. it is quiet, has been quiet for a while. he calls me, and i march  from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged, such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers— dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares? they go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.  but there is more. wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered enough? this evening we go to a party, the breeze dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed. we tell our funny story about the bees. at two in the morning we come home, and a friend,  a scientist, comes with us, in his car. we’re going to save the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave the rest. we hope that the neighbors are safe in bed, taking no note of these private catastrophes.  he wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. not a bad thing to look into. in the night we rattle and raise the lid of the garbage can. flashlights in hand, we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve of happenings. i can’t touch it. i hate the self-examined  who’ve killed the self. the dead are darker, but the others have moved in the ooze toward the next moment. my god one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes. searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze  for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind. the men do it. making a claim on the future, as love makes a claim on the future, grasping. and i, underhand, i feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave taking direction. unpleading, the men prod  till all that grubby softness wants to give,to give.

 i stately, kindly, lordly friend, condescend here to sit by me, and turn glorious eyes that smile and burn, golden eyes, love's lustrous meed, on the golden page i read.  all your wondrous wealth of hair, dark and fair, silken-shaggy, soft and bright as the clouds and beams of night, pays my reverent hand's caress back with friendlier gentleness.  dogs may fawn on all and some as they come; you, a friend of loftier mind, answer friends alone in kind. just your foot upon my hand softly bids it understand.  morning round this silent sweet garden-seat sheds its wealth of gathering light, thrills the gradual clouds with might, changes woodland, orchard, heath, lawn, and garden there beneath.  fair and dim they gleamed below: now they glow deep as even your sunbright eyes, fair as even the wakening skies. can it not or can it be now that you give thanks to see?  may not you rejoice as i, seeing the sky change to heaven revealed, and bid earth reveal the heaven it hid all night long from stars and moon, now the sun sets all in tune?  what within you wakes with day who can say? all too little may we tell, friends who like each other well, what might haply, if we might, bid us read our lives aright.  ii wild on woodland ways your sires flashed like fires: fair as flame and fierce and fleet as with wings on wingless feet shone and sprang your mother, free, bright and brave as wind or sea.  free and proud and glad as they, here to-day rests or roams their radiant child, vanquished not, but reconciled, free from curb of aught above save the lovely curb of love.  love through dreams of souls divine fain would shine round a dawn whose light and song then should right our mutual wrong — speak, and seal the love-lit law sweet assisi's seer foresaw.  dreams were theirs; yet haply may dawn a day when such friends and fellows born, seeing our earth as fair at morn, may for wiser love's sake see more of heaven's deep heart than we.

 the dark is thrown back from the brightness, like hair cast over a shoulder. i am alone,  four years older; like the chairs and the walls which i once watched brighten with you beside me. i was to waken never like this, whatever came or was taken.  the stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. apples come, and the month for their fall. the bark spreads, the roots tighten. though today be the last or tomorrow all, you will not mind.  that i may not remember does not matter. i shall not be with you again. what we knew, even now must scatter and be ruined, and blow like dust in the rain.  you have been dead a long season and have less than desire who were lover with lover; and i have life—that old reason to wait for what comes, to leave what is over.

 “prince jesus, crush those bastards ...” —francois villon, grand testament it is the unremarkable that will last,  as in brueghel’s camouflage, where the wren’s withheld, while elsewhere on a hill, small hawks (or are they other birds?) are busily unraveling eyelashes &amp; pupils from sunburned thieves outstretched on scaffolds, their last vision obscured by wings, then broken, entered. i cannot tell whether their blood spurts, or just spills, their faces are wings, &amp; their bodies are uncovered.  the twittering they hear is the final trespass.  ~  and all later luxuries—the half-dressed neighbor couple shouting insults at each other just beyond her bra on a cluttered windowsill, then ceasing it when a door was slammed to emphasize, like trouble,  the quiet flowing into things then, spreading its wake from the child’s toy left out on a lawn to the broken treatise of jet-trails drifting above—seem keel scrapes on the shores of some enlarging mistake,  a wrong so wide no one can speak of it now in the town that once had seemed, like its supporting factories that manufactured poems &amp; weaponry, like such a good idea. and wasn’t it everyone’s?  wasn’t the sad pleasure of assembly lines a replica of the wren’s perfect, camouflaged self-sufficiency, and of its refusal even to be pretty, surviving in a plumage dull enough to blend in with  a hemline of smoke, sky, &amp; a serene indifference?  ~  the dead wren i found on a gravel drive one morning, all beige above and off-white underneath, the body lighter, no more than a vacant tent  of oily feathers stretched, blent, &amp; lacquered shut against the world—was a world i couldn’t touch. and in its skull a snow of lice had set up such an altar, the congregation spreading from the tongue  to round, bare sills that had been its eyes, i let it drop, my hand changed for a moment by a thing so common it was never once distracted from the nothing all wrens meant, the one feather on the road.  no feeding in the wake of cavalry or kings changed it. even in the end it swerved away, &amp; made the abrupt riddle all things come to seem ... irrelevant: the tucked claws clutched emptiness like a stick.  and if death whispered as always in the language of curling leaves, or a later one that makes us stranger, “don’t you come near me motherfucker”; if the tang of metal in slang made the new world fertile,  still ... as they resumed their quarrel in the quiet air, i could hear the species cheep in what they said ... until their voices rose. until the sound of a slap erased a world, &amp; the woman, in a music stripped of all prayer,  began sobbing, &amp; the man become bystander cried o jesus. in the sky, the first stars were already faint and timeless, but what could they matter to that boy, blent to no choir, who saw at last the clean wings of indifferent  hunger, &amp; despair? around him the other petty thieves,  with arms outstretched, &amp; eyes pecked out by birds, reclined, fastened forever to scaffolds which gradually would cover an empire’s hills &amp; line its roads as far as anyone escaping in a cart could see, his swerving mind  on the dark brimming up in everything, the reins going slack in his hand as the cart slows, &amp; stops, and the horse sees its own breath go out onto the cold air, &amp; gazes after the off-white plume,  and seems amazed by it, by its breath, by everything. but the man slumped behind it, dangling a lost nail between his lips, only stares at the swishing tail, at each white breath going out, thinning, &amp; then vanishing,  for he has grown tired of amazing things.

 loving friend, the gift of one, who, her own true faith, hath run, through thy lower nature ; be my benediction said with my hand upon thy head, gentle fellow-creature !  like a lady's ringlets brown, flow thy silken ears adown either side demurely, of thy silver-suited breast shining out from all the rest of thy body purely.  darkly brown thy body is, till the sunshine, striking this, alchemize its dulness, — when the sleek curls manifold flash all over into gold, with a burnished fulness.  underneath my stroking hand, startled eyes of hazel bland kindling, growing larger, — up thou leapest with a spring, full of prank and curvetting, leaping like a charger.  leap ! thy broad tail waves a light ; leap ! thy slender feet are bright, canopied in fringes. leap — those tasselled ears of thine flicker strangely, fair and fine, down their golden inches  yet, my pretty sportive friend, little is 't to such an end that i praise thy rareness ! other dogs may be thy peers haply in these drooping ears, and this glossy fairness.  but of thee it shall be said, this dog watched beside a bed day and night unweary, — watched within a curtained room, where no sunbeam brake the gloom round the sick and dreary.  roses, gathered for a vase, in that chamber died apace, beam and breeze resigning — this dog only, waited on, knowing that when light is gone, love remains for shining.  other dogs in thymy dew tracked the hares and followed through sunny moor or meadow — this dog only, crept and crept next a languid cheek that slept, sharing in the shadow.  other dogs of loyal cheer bounded at the whistle clear, up the woodside hieing — this dog only, watched in reach of a faintly uttered speech, or a louder sighing.  and if one or two quick tears dropped upon his glossy ears, or a sigh came double, — up he sprang in eager haste, fawning, fondling, breathing fast, in a tender trouble.  and this dog was satisfied, if a pale thin hand would glide, down his dewlaps sloping, — which he pushed his nose within, after, — platforming his chin on the palm left open.  this dog, if a friendly voice call him now to blyther choice than such chamber-keeping, come out ! ' praying from the door, — presseth backward as before, up against me leaping.  therefore to this dog will i, tenderly not scornfully, render praise and favour ! with my hand upon his head, is my benediction said therefore, and for ever.  and because he loves me so, better than his kind will do often, man or woman, give i back more love again than dogs often take of men, — leaning from my human.  blessings on thee, dog of mine, pretty collars make thee fine, sugared milk make fat thee ! pleasures wag on in thy tail — hands of gentle motion fail nevermore, to pat thee !  downy pillow take thy head, silken coverlid bestead, sunshine help thy sleeping ! no fly 's buzzing wake thee up — no man break thy purple cup, set for drinking deep in.  whiskered cats arointed flee — sturdy stoppers keep from thee cologne distillations ; nuts lie in thy path for stones, and thy feast-day macaroons turn to daily rations !  mock i thee, in wishing weal ? — tears are in my eyes to feel thou art made so straightly, blessing needs must straighten too, — little canst thou joy or do, thou who lovest greatly.  yet be blessed to the height of all good and all delight pervious to thy nature, — only loved beyond that line, with a love that answers thine, loving fellow-creature !

 helen, thy beauty is to me like those nicéan barks of yore, that gently, o'er a perfumed sea, the weary, way-worn wanderer bore to his own native shore.  on desperate seas long wont to roam, thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, thy naiad airs have brought me home to the glory that was greece, and the grandeur that was rome.  lo! in yon brilliant window-niche how statue-like i see thee stand, the agate lamp within thy hand! ah, psyche, from the regions which are holy-land!  
NEW POEM
 had we but world enough and time, this coyness, lady, were no crime. we would sit down, and think which way to walk, and pass our long love’s day. thou by the indian ganges’ side shouldst rubies find; i by the tide of humber would complain. i would love you ten years before the flood, and you should, if you please, refuse till the conversion of the jews. my vegetable love should grow vaster than empires and more slow; an hundred years should go to praise thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze; two hundred to adore each breast, but thirty thousand to the rest; an age at least to every part, and the last age should show your heart. for, lady, you deserve this state, nor would i love at lower rate. but at my back i always hear time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near; and yonder all before us lie deserts of vast eternity. thy beauty shall no more be found; nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound my echoing song; then worms shall try that long-preserved virginity, and your quaint honour turn to dust, and into ashes all my lust; the grave’s a fine and private place, but none, i think, do there embrace. now therefore, while the youthful hue sits on thy skin like morning dew, and while thy willing soul transpires at every pore with instant fires, now let us sport us while we may, and now, like amorous birds of prey, rather at once our time devour than languish in his slow-chapped power. let us roll all our strength and all our sweetness up into one ball, and tear our pleasures with rough strife through the iron gates of life: thus, though we cannot make our sun stand still, yet we will make him run.  
NEW POEM
 beloved beauty who inspires love in me from afar, your face obscured except when your celestial image stirs my heart in sleep, or in the fields where light and nature's laughter shine more lovely— was it maybe you who blessed the innocent age called golden, and do you now, blithe spirit, fly among men? or does that miser fate who hides you from us save you for the future?  no hope of seeing you alive remains for me now, except when, naked and alone, my soul will go down a new street to its unknown home. already at the dawn of my dark, uncertain day i imagined you a fellow traveler on this arid ground. but there's no thing that resembles you on earth. and if someone had a face like yours, in act and word she'd be, though something like you, far less beautiful.  in spite of all the suffering fate decreed for human time, if there were anyone on earth who truly loved you as my thought depicts you, this life for him would be a blessing. and i see clearly how your love would lead me still to strive for praise and virtue, as i used to in my early years. though heaven gave no comfort for our troubles, yet with you mortal life would be like what in heaven leads to divinity.  in the valleys, where the song of the weary farmer sounds, and when i sit and mourn the illusions of youth fading, and on the hills where i recall and grieve for my lost desires and my life's lost hope, i think of you and start to shake. if only i, in this sad age and unhealthy atmosphere, could keep hold of your noble look; for since the real thing's missing i must make do with the image.  whether you are the only one of the eternal ideas eternal wisdom refuses to see arrayed in sensible form to know the pains of mortal life in transitory spoils, or if in the supernal spheres another earth from among unnumbered worlds receives you and a near star lovelier than the sun warms you and you breathe benigner ether, from here, where years are both ill-starred and brief, accept this hymn from your unnoticed lover.

 why dost thou shade thy lovely face? o why does that eclipsing hand of thine deny the sunshine of the sun’s enlivening eye?  without thy light what light remains in me? thou art my life; my way, my light’s in thee; i live, i move, and by thy beams i see.  thou art my life-if thou but turn away my life’s a thousand deaths. thou art my way- without thee, love, i travel not but stray.  my light thou art-without thy glorious sight my eyes are darken’d with eternal night. my love, thou art my way, my life, my light.  thou art my way; i wander if thou fly. thou art my light; if hid, how blind am i! thou art my life; if thou withdraw’st, i die.  my eyes are dark and blind, i cannot see: to whom or whither should my darkness flee, but to that light?-and who’s that light but thee?  if i have lost my path, dear lover, say, shall i still wander in a doubtful way? love, shall a lamb of israel’s sheepfold stray?  my path is lost, my wandering steps do stray; i cannot go, nor can i safely stay; whom should i seek but thee, my path, my way?  and yet thou turn’st thy face away and fly’st me! and yet i sue for grace and thou deny’st me! speak, art thou angry, love, or only try’st me?  thou art the pilgrim’s path, the blind man’s eye, the dead man’s life. on thee my hopes rely: if i but them remove, i surely die.  dissolve thy sunbeams, close thy wings and stay! see, see how i am blind, and dead, and stray! -o thou art my life, my light, my way!  then work thy will! if passion bid me flee, my reason shall obey, my wings shall be stretch’d out no farther than from me to thee!

 well, honest john, how fare you now at home? the spring is come, and birds are building nests; the old cock-robin to the sty is come, with olive feathers and its ruddy breast; and the old cock, with wattles and red comb, struts with the hens, and seems to like some best, then crows, and looks about for little crumbs, swept out by little folks an hour ago; the pigs sleep in the sty; the bookman comes— the little boy lets home-close nesting go, and pockets tops and taws, where daisies blow, to look at the new number just laid down, with lots of pictures, and good stories too, and jack the giant-killer's high renown.

 into the changes of autumn brush the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears were the tinsel browns. they made her. i could not see her. she reappeared, stuffed with apples, and i shot her. into the pines she ran, and i ran after. i might have lost her, seeing no sign of blood or scuffle, but felt myself part of the woods, a woman with a doe’s ears, and heard her dying, counted her last breaths like a song of dying, and found her dying. i shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets, then poked her with the gun barrel because her eyes were dusty and unreal. i opened her belly and pushed the insides like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole, skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee, took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell that was herself. ah, i closed her eyes. i left her refolded in some briars with the last sun on her head like a benediction, head tilted on its axis of neck and barren bone; head bent wordless over a death, though i heard the night wind blowing through her fur, heard riot in the emptied head.  
NEW POEM
 well then; the promis'd hour is come at last; the present age of wit obscures the past: strong were our sires; and as they fought they writ, conqu'ring with force of arms, and dint of wit; theirs was the giant race, before the flood; and thus, when charles return'd, our empire stood. like janus he the stubborn soil manur'd, with rules of husbandry the rankness cur'd: tam'd us to manners, when the stage was rude; and boisterous english wit, with art endu'd. our age was cultivated thus at length; but what we gained in skill we lost in strength. our builders were, with want of genius, curst; the second temple was not like the first: till you, the best vitruvius, come at length; our beauties equal; but excel our strength. firm doric pillars found your solid base: the fair corinthian crowns the higher space; thus all below is strength, and all above is grace. in easy dialogue is fletcher's praise: he mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise. great jonson did by strength of judgment please: yet doubling fletcher's force, he wants his ease. in differing talents both adorn'd their age; one for the study, t'other for the stage. but both to congreve justly shall submit, one match'd in judgment, both o'er-match'd in wit. in him all beauties of this age we see; etherege's courtship, southern's purity; the satire, wit, and strength of manly wycherly. all this in blooming youth you have achiev'd; nor are your foil'd contemporaries griev'd; so much the sweetness of your manners move, we cannot envy you because we love. fabius might joy in scipio, when he saw a beardless consul made against the law, and join his suffrage to the votes of rome; though he with hannibal was overcome. thus old romano bow'd to raphael's fame; and scholar to the youth he taught, became.  oh that your brows my laurel had sustain'd, well had i been depos'd, if you had reign'd! the father had descended for the son; for only you are lineal to the throne. thus when the state one edward did depose; a greater edward in his room arose. but now, not i, but poetry is curs'd; for tom the second reigns like tom the first. but let 'em not mistake my patron's part; nor call his charity their own desert. yet this i prophesy; thou shalt be seen, (tho' with some short parenthesis between:) high on the throne of wit; and seated there, not mine (that's little) but thy laurel wear. thy first attempt an early promise made; that early promise this has more than paid. so bold, yet so judiciously you dare, that your least praise, is to be regular. time, place, and action, may with pains be wrought, but genius must be born; and never can be taught. this is your portion; this your native store; heav'n that but once was prodigal before, to shakespeare gave as much; she could not give him more.  maintain your post: that's all the fame you need; for 'tis impossible you should proceed. already i am worn with cares and age; and just abandoning th' ungrateful stage: unprofitably kept at heav'n's expense, i live a rent-charge on his providence: but you, whom ev'ry muse and grace adorn, whom i foresee to better fortune born, be kind to my remains; and oh defend, against your judgment your departed friend! let not the insulting foe my fame pursue; but shade those laurels which descend to you: and take for tribute what these lines express: you merit more; nor could my love do less.

 when thou, poor excommunicate from all the joys of love, shalt see the full reward and glorious fate which my strong faith shall purchase me, then curse thine own inconstancy.  a fairer hand than thine shall cure that heart, which thy false oaths did wound; and to my soul, a soul more pure than thine shall by love's hand be bound, and both with equal glory crown'd.  then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain to love, as i did once to thee; when all thy tears shall be as vain as mine were then, for thou shalt be damn'd for thy false apostasy.

 is this the world, miss bliss? stacks of ingots on the docks where my brother works? work and things on the threshold of raw and radiated. bananas gassed in shacks to ripen by the forklifts. ships of foreign port. ships of car parts and dyes. the beef-stripping business. things, miss bliss, and work. flavors translated from costa rica, volatile oils, seized cargoes, incensed loads, cracked coal. after a week the exposed skin around his wrists was blue, vein color, the color of the world. labor, and the union of the senses to deliver us from our geography. everywhere is here.  when the stevedores break for lunch, one is responsible for the pot-luck of cold meats, the deep dish, leftovers from the wedding, while one is responsible for inviting the office women. these men set the table with the pomp of the late elizabeth: linen, gilt plates, a taster, and a trumpeted summons. they force the choice bits on each other. they talk about blood and solomon’s operation. they talk about lily’s kids and the dead as they come hack to speak to lonnie in his sleep. and they talk about food they could not eat, the boss, and a dream of playing lead before they switch on the tv with its loud prophecies of soap. they eat deeply in gratitude. the pot scraped with a spoon, that sound. the world’s a word, and a lever.  the ghosts at the banquet want something, miss bliss. from one world i come to you with two blue wrists, my brother’s rage against the living the world owes, and everything i do that’s duplicate. my cells split. they can’t be true. i smoke. i turn out a little verse. i make a small sacrifice. i throw what cannot be eaten away. i throw it on the ground. here, some things you can’t eat.

NEW POEM
 the turn  brave infant of saguntum, clear thy coming forth in that great year, when the prodigious hannibal did crown his rage with razing your immortal town. thou, looking then about, ere thou wert half got out, wise child, didst hastily return, and mad’st thy mother’s womb thine urn. how summed a circle didst thou leave mankind of deepest lore, could we the center find!  the counterturn  did wiser nature draw thee back from out the horror of that sack, where shame, faith, honor, and regard of right lay trampled on; the deeds of death and night urged, hurried forth, and hurled upon th’ affrighted world; sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met, and all on utmost ruin set, as, could they but life’s miseries foresee, no doubt all infants would return like thee?  the stand  for what is life, if measured by the space, not by the act? or maskèd man, if valued by his face above his fact? here’s one outlived his peers and told forth fourscore years; he vexèd time and busied the whole state, troubled both foes and friends; but ever to no ends: what did this stirrer but die late? how well at twenty had he fall’n or stood! for three of his fourscore he did no good.  the turn  he entered well, by virtuous parts, got up and thrived with honest arts; he purchased friends, and fame, and honors then, and had his noble name advanced with men; but weary of that flight he stooped in all men’s sight to sordid flatteries, acts of strife, and sunk in that dead sea of life so deep, as he did then death’s waters sup, but that the cork of title buoyed him up.  the counterturn  alas, but morison fell young; he never fell, thou fall’st, my tongue. he stood, a soldier to the last right end, a perfect patriot, and a noble friend, but most a virtuous son. all offices were done by him so ample, full, and round, in weight, in measure, number, sound, as, though his age imperfect might appear, his life was of humanity the sphere.  the stand  go now, and tell out days summed up with fears, and make them years; produce thy mass of miseries on the stage to swell thin age; repeat of things a throng, to show thou hast been long, not lived; for life doth her great actions spell by what was done and wrought in season, and so brought to light: her measures are, how well each syllabe answered, and was formed how fair; these make the lines of life, and that’s her air.  the turn  it is not growing like a tree in bulk doth make man better be; or standing long an oak, three hundred year, to fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere: a lily of a day is fairer far in may; although it fall and die that night, it was the plant and flower of light. in small proportions we just beauties see, and in short measures life may perfect be.  the counterturn  call, noble lucius, then for wine, and let thy looks with gladness shine; accept this garland, plant it on thy head, and think, nay know, thy morison’s not dead. he leaped the present age, possessed with holy rage to see that bright eternal day; of which we priests and poets say such truths as we expect for happy men, and there he lives with memory, and ben  the stand  jonson! who sung thus of him, ere he went himself to rest, or taste a part of that full joy he meant to have expressed in this bright asterism; where it were friendship’s schism (were not his lucius long with us to tarry) to separate these twi- lights, the dioscuri, and keep the one half from his harry. but fate doth so alternate the design, whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.  the turn  and shine as you exalted are, two names of friendship, but one star: of hearts the union. and those not by chance made, or indenture, or leased out t’advance the profits for a time. no pleasures vain did chime of rimes, or riots, at your feasts, orgies of drink, or feigned protests, but simple love of greatness and of good; that knits brave minds and manners more than blood.  the counterturn  this made you first to know the why you liked, then after to apply that liking, and approach so one the tother, till either grew a portion of the other: each styled by his end the copy of his friend. you lived to be the great surnames and titles by which all made claims unto the virtue. nothing perfect done, but as a cary, or a morison.  the stand  and such a force the fair example had, as they that saw the good, and durst not practice it, were glad that such a law was left yet to mankind; where they might read and find friendship, indeed, was written, not in words; and with the heart, not pen, of two so early men, whose lines her rolls were, and recòrds, who, ere the first down bloomèd on the chin, had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.

 a sestina you who are happy in a thousand homes, or overworked therein, to a dumb peace; whose souls are wholly centered in the life of that small group you personally love; who told you that you need not know or care about the sin and sorrow of the world?  do you believe the sorrow of the world does not concern you in your little homes? — that you are licensed to avoid the care and toil for human progress, human peace, and the enlargement of our power of love until it covers every field of life?  the one first duty of all human life is to promote the progress of the world in righteousness, in wisdom, truth and love; and you ignore it, hidden in your homes, content to keep them in uncertain peace, content to leave all else without your care.  yet you are mothers! and a mother's care is the first step toward friendly human life. life where all nations in untroubled peace unite to raise the standard of the world and make the happiness we seek in homes spread everywhere in strong and fruitful love.  you are content to keep that mighty love in its first steps forever; the crude care of animals for mate and young and homes, instead of pouring it abroad in life, its mighty current feeding all the world till every human child can grow in peace.  you cannot keep your small domestic peace your little pool of undeveloped love, while the neglected, starved, unmothered world struggles and fights for lack of mother's care, and its tempestuous, bitter, broken life beats in upon you in your selfish homes.  we all may have our homes in joy and peace when woman's life, in its rich power of love is joined with man's to care for all the world.

 are you content, you pretty three-years’ wife? are you content and satisfied to live on what your loving husband loves to give, and give to him your life?  are you content with work, — to toil alone, to clean things dirty and to soil things clean; to be a kitchen-maid, be called a queen, — queen of a cook-stove throne?  are you content to reign in that small space -- a wooden palace and a yard-fenced land -- with other queens abundant on each hand, each fastened in her place?  are you content to rear your children so? untaught yourself, untrained, perplexed, distressed, are you so sure your way is always best? that you can always know?  have you forgotten how you used to long in days of ardent girlhood, to be great, to help the groaning world, to serve the state, to be so wise — so strong?  and are you quite convinced this is the way, the only way a woman’s duty lies -- knowing all women so have shut their eyes? seeing the world to-day?  having no dream of life in fuller store? of growing to be more than that you are? doing the things you know do better far, yet doing others - more?  losing no love, but finding as you grew that as you entered upon nobler life you so became a richer, sweeter wife, a wiser mother too?  what holds you? ah, my dear, it is your throne, your paltry queenship in that narrow place, your antique labours, your restricted space, your working all alone!  be not deceived! ‘tis not your wifely bond that holds you, nor the mother’s royal power, but selfish, slavish service hour by hour -- a life with no beyond!

 i  calm was the sea to which your course you kept, oh, how much calmer than all southern seas! many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze wafted from mothers that of old have wept. all souls of children taken as they slept are your companions, partners of your ease, and the green souls of all these autumn trees are with you through the silent spaces swept. your virgin body gave its gentle breath untainted to the gods. why should we grieve, but that we merit not your holy death? we shall not loiter long, your friends and i; living you made it goodlier to live, dead you will make it easier to die.  ii  with you a part of me hath passed away; for in the peopled forest of my mind a tree made leafless by this wintry wind shall never don again its green array. chapel and fireside, country road and bay, have something of their friendliness resigned; another, if i would, i could not find, and i am grown much older in a day. but yet i treasure in my memory your gift of charity, your mellow ease, and the dear honour of your amity; for these once mine, my life is rich with these. and i scarce know which part may greater be,— what i keep of you, or you rob of me.  iii  your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight until a kinder wind unfurl her sail; your docile spirit, wingèd by this gale, hath at the dawning fled into the light. and i half know why heaven deemed it right your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail; god hath them still, for ever they avail, eternity hath borrowed that delight. for long ago i taught my thoughts to run where all the great things live that lived of yore, and in eternal quiet float and soar; there all my loves are gathered into one, where change is not, nor parting any more, nor revolution of the moon and sun.  iv  in my deep heart these chimes would still have rung to toll your passing, had you not been dead; for time a sadder mask than death may spread over the face that ever should be young. the bough that falls with all its trophies hung falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung. and though the after world will never hear the happy name of one so gently true, nor chronicles write large this fatal year, yet we who loved you, though we be but few, keep you in whatsoe’er is good, and rear in our weak virtues monuments to you.

 wearing a tawny lion pelt upon my spindly shoulders i carry both of them, my father and my mother, into the darkness, my father hoarsely singing, “they are there!” —the glimmer of something that is glimmering there— “i see the glow of weapons in the shadows!” through which with my purblind eyes i think i see something in the darkness waiting there. above me in the dark my mother’s voice calls down to me, “who’s there? who is it there?” step after step together we make our way, in the darkness of my memory of our house.

NEW POEM
 abandoned in a field near yass a cobwebbed car once kept us warm and when it rained, though we shivered with sickness, there came a moment of perfect happiness, faces nestled in the vinyl, sleep coming on, surrounded by metal that in upcoming decades would oxidise to flakes.  asleep at last, last of the valium, we came to know a car too is a flower and pollen its decay. in the dry air at dawn the cicadas kept still. the space that mass sat in decided how mass was to move. we dreamed of valleys of olive trees, silver side out.  the lions preened. we shivered with need. a mechanic showed me once how the spark-paths from spark-plugs looked, if you looked close enough, like mountain ravines from the air. the deeper the groove the faster the current. we shivered, this our habit, this flowing.  it takes the breath away. there are gum trees crackling from it two decades later. i slept so still beneath that mass of dreams like sediment compressed beneath a lake. i woke and the tributes and glory were gone and the crops all withered and money was merely the index of anxiety.  when we realised this our hearts swelled in exultation. even time would forget there was reason for fear: that decay seemed to will itself upon us. i was off the air, delirious with substance. the kite hawks grew ashamed. all nature squirmed. i was off the air, light-headed with voracity.  the theme just kept repeating itself, year in year out, same demon different bodies. a nurse said when you stay, when you leave those wet imprints in our airspace, these sheets smell like formaldehyde, like death. we had merely reached early, down the end of the river, the leprosarium  of feeling, and all things stood for every other thing, creepers, vines, tendrils, anacondas, inert surrender, such listlessness, and yes the very rage with which we chased the very forms of it, the lineaments of nothingness, the powders of the comatose, the bliss.  this was the state of the world. heading backwards we learned the flea-fish was the smallest animal before the insect kingdom began. forwards, there were only the sudden deaths of galaxies. and yet when we practised love there seemed on certain days an awful lot of space; and so much sky.  never had i lain then at kangaroo valley so comfortable in my own body. a virtual flatness and that centrifuge in the stomach stilled and my spine a spirit-level. the smell of coffee drifting in brought back to me that lily-white girl and that sad hour of need. how brittle every bone was then. how  could one not be completely bedraggled by time or compulsion or duplicity? i was all those things and am. i was so tired with the not-being-here inside of it all that fatigue was like oxygen, given of all the givens, sensurround of the gods. but i was gulping and heaving by then.  and that is all so long ago. though when you forget the last time: most likely it is not the last time. and when dreams don’t come, when mastodons and minotaurs curdle in the night-reaches and the bulls lie fallow in dawn-sweats: sleep some more. wait. sleep on. and swim.

 flavia. the wretched flavia on her couch reclin'd, thus breath'd the anguish of a wounded mind ; a glass revers'd in her right hand she bore, for now she shun'd the face she sought before.  ' how am i chang'd ! alas ! how am i grown ' a frightful spectre, to myself unknown ! ' where's my complexion ? where the radiant bloom, ' that promis'd happiness for years to come ? ' then with what pleasure i this face survey'd ! ' to look once more, my visits oft delay'd ! ' charm'd with the view, a fresher red would rise, ' and a new life shot sparkling from my eyes !  ' ah ! faithless glass, my wonted bloom restore; ' alas ! i rave, that bloom is now no more ! ' the greatest good the gods on men bestow, ' ev'n youth itself, to me is useless now. ' there was a time, (oh ! that i could forget !) ' when opera-tickets pour'd before my feet ; ' and at the ring, where brightest beauties shine, ' the earliest cherries of the spring were mine. ' witness, o lilly ; and thou, motteux , tell ' how much japan these eyes have made ye sell. ' with what contempt ye you saw me oft despise ' the humble offer of the raffled prize ; ' for at the raffle still the prize i bore, ' with scorn rejected, or with triumph wore ! ' now beauty's fled, and presents are no more !  ' for me the patriot has the house forsook, ' and left debates to catch a passing look : ' for me the soldier has soft verses writ ; ' for me the beau has aim'd to be a wit. ' for me the wit to nonsense was betray'd ; ' the gamester has for me his dun delay'd, ' and overseen the card, i would have play'd . ' the bold and haughty by success made vain, ' aw'd by my eyes has trembled to complain: ' the bashful 'squire touch'd by a wish unknown, ' has dar'd to speak with spirit not his own ; ' fir'd by one wish, all did alike adore ; ' now beauty's fled, and lovers are no more!  ' as round the room i turn my weeping eyes, ' new unaffected scenes of sorrow rise ! ' far from my sight that killing picture bear, ' the face disfigure, and the canvas tear ! ' that picture which with pride i us'd to show, ' the lost resemblance but upbraids me now. ' and thou, my toilette! where i oft have sat , ' while hours unheeded pass'd in deep debate, ' how curls should fall, or where a patch to place : ' if blue or scarlet best became my face; ' now on some happier nymph thy aid bestow ; ' on fairer heads, ye useless jewels glow ! ' no borrow'd lustre can my charms restore ; ' beauty is fled, and dress is now no more !  ' ye meaner beauties, i permit ye shine ; ' go, triumph in the hearts that once were mine ; ' but midst your triumphs with confusion know, ' 'tis to my ruin all your arms ye owe. ' would pitying heav'n restore my wonted mien, ' ye still might move unthought-of and unseen. ' but oh ! how vain, how wretched is the boast ' of beauty faded, and of empire lost ! ' what now is left but weeping, to deplore ' my beauty fled, and empire now no more !  ' ye, cruel chymists, what with-held your aid ! ' could no pomatums save a trembling maid ? ' how false and trifling is that art you boast ; ' no art can give me back my beauty lost. ' in tears, surrounded by my friends i lay, ' mask'd o'er and trembled at the sight of day; ' mirmillo came my fortune to deplore, ' (a golden headed cane, well carv'd he bore) ' cordials, he cried, my spirits must restore : ' beauty is fled, and spirit is no more !  ' galen, the grave ; officious squirt was there, ' with fruitless grief and unavailing care : ' machaon too, the great machaon, known ' by his red cloak and his superior frown ; ' and why, he cry'd, this grief and this despair ? ' you shall again be well, again be fair ; ' believe my oath ; (with that an oath he swore) ' false was his oath ; my beauty is no more !  ' cease, hapless maid, no more thy tale pursue, ' forsake mankind, and bid the world adieu ! ' monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway ; ' all strive to serve, and glory to obey : ' alike unpitied when depos'd they grow ; ' men mock the idol of their former vow.  ' adieu ! ye parks ! — in some obscure recess, ' where gentle streams will weep at my distress, ' where no false friend will in my grief take part, ' and mourn my ruin with a joyful heart ; ' there let me live in some deserted place, ' there hide in shades this lost inglorious face. ' ye, operas, circles, i no more must view ! ' my toilette, patches, all the world adieu!

 silliander and patch. thou so many favours hast receiv'd, wondrous to tell, and hard to be believ'd, oh ! h—— d, to my lays attention lend, hear how two lovers boastingly contend ; like thee successful, such their bloomy youth, renown'd alike for gallantry and truth.  st. james's bell had toll'd some wretches in, (as tatter'd riding-hoods alone could sin) the happier sinners now their charms put out , and to their manteaus their complexions suit : the opera queens had finish'd half their faces, and city-dames allready taken places ; fops of all kinds to see the lion, run ; the beauties stay till the first act's begun, and beaux step home to put fresh linen on. no well-dress'd youth in coffee-house remain'd, but pensive patch, who on the window lean'd ; and silliander, that alert and gay, first pick'd his teeth, and then began to say.  silliander. why all these sighs ? ah ! why so pensive grown ? some cause there is that thus you sit alone. does hapless passion all this sorrow move ? or dost thou envy where the ladies love ?  patch. if, whom they love, my envy must pursue, 'tis sure, at least, i never envy you.  silliander. no, i'm unhappy, you are in the right, 'tis you they favour, and 'tis me they slight. yet i could tell, but that i hate to boast, a club of ladies where 'tis me they toast.  patch. toasting does seldom any favour prove ; like us, they never toast the thing they love. a certain duke one night my health begun ; with chearful pledges round the room it run, till the young silvia press'd to drink it too, started, and vow'd she knew not what to do : what, drink a fellow's health ! she dy'd with shame : yet blush'd whenever she pronounc'd my name.  silliander. ill fates pursue me, may i never find the dice propitious, or the ladies kind, if fair miss flippy's fan i did not tear, and one from me she condescends to wear.  patch. women are always ready to receive ; 'tis then a favour when the sex will give. a lady (but she is too great to name) beauteous in person, spotless is her fame, with gentle strugglings let me force this ring ; another day may give another thing.  silliander. i cou'd say something — see this billet-doux — and as for presents — look upon my shoe — these buckles were not forc'd, nor half a theft, but a young countess fondly made the gift.  patch. my countess is more nice, more artful too, affects to fly that i may fierce pursue : this snuff-box which i begg'd, she still deny'd, and when i strove to snatch it, seem'd to hide ; she laugh'd and fled, and as i sought to seize, with affectation cramm'd it down her stays : yet hop'd she did not place it there unseen, i press'd her breasts, and pull'd it from between.  silliander. last night, as i stood ogling of her grace, drinking delicious poison from her face, the soft enchantress did that face decline, nor ever rais'd her eyes to meet with mine ; with sudden art some secret did pretend, lean'd cross two chairs to whisper to a friend, while the stiff whalebone with the motion rose, and thousand beauties to my sight expose.  patch. early this morn — (but i was ask'd to come) i drank bohea in cælia's dressing-room : warm from her bed, to me alone within, her night-gown fasten'd with a single pin ; her night-cloaths tumbled with resistless grace, and her bright hair play'd careless round her face ; reaching the kettle, made her gown unpin, she wore no waistcoat, and her shift was thin.  silliander. see titiana driving to the park, hark ! let us follow, 'tis not yet too dark ; in her all beauties of the spring are seen, her cheeks are rosy, and her mantle green.  patch. see, tintoretta to the opera goes ! haste, or the crowd will not permit our bows ; in her the glory of the heav'ns we view, her eyes are star-like, and her mantle blue.  silliander. what colour does in cælia's stockings shine ? reveal that secret, and the prize is thine.  patch. what are her garters ! tell me if you can ; i'll freely own thee for the happier man.  thus patch continued his heroic strain, while silliander but contends in vain. after a conquest so important gain'd, unrival'd patch in ev'ry ruelle reign'd.

 we thought nothing of it, he says, though some came so close to where we slept.  i try to see him as a boy, back in the philippines, waking  to the sound of machine guns. his family would spend their morning  spreading a paste over the sores  of the house’s thick walls.  he tells how he touched  points where bullets entered,  his fingers, he says, disappeared into the holes,  as if inside there existed a space where everything from this world could vanish.  here we could place the memory of my sister,  his daughter, who died after a car wreck.  wedge her into the smoky path  &amp; cover her in sunlight.  the family next door is raking leaves in the yard.   a father scolds his children for jumping  into large piles he arranged into a crescent moon.  we cannot hear them from inside,  but i feel they are frightened as he grabs both of them around the waist &amp; spins.  i wait for the ending to my father’s story,  but he is too busy smiling, as if enjoying the silence  of bullets frozen there in his mind.

 for my mother, yoshiko horikoshi roripaugh 1.x-ray  my mother carried the chest x-ray in her lap on the plane, inside a manila envelope that read do not bend and, garnished with leis at the honolulu airport, waited in line—this strange image of ribcage, chain-link vertebrae, pearled milk of lung, and the murky enigmatic chambers of her heart in hand. until it was her turn and the immigration officer held the black-and-white film up to sun, light pierced clean through her, and she was ushered from one life through the gate of another, wreathed in the dubious and illusory perfume of plucked orchids.   2.ceramic pig  newly arrived in new mexico, stiff and crisp in new dungarees, her honeymoon, they drove into the mountains in a borrowed car, spiraling up and up toward the rumor of deer, into the green tangy turpentine scent of pine, where air crackled with the sizzling collision of bees, furred legs grappling velvet bodies as they mated midair, and where they came upon the disconsolate gaze of a madonna alcoved against the side of the road, her feet wreathed in candles, fruit, flowers, and other offerings. nearby, a vendor with a wooden plank balanced between two folding chairs and the glossy row of ceramic pigs lined up across, brilliant glaze shimmering the heat. my mother fell in love with the red- and-blue splash of flowers tattooed into fat flanks and bellies, the green arabesques of stem and leaf circling hoof, snout, and ear.so exotic. years later she still describes the pig with a sigh—heartbroken, the word she chooses with careful consideration. she’d filled the pig with kennedy dollars from the grocery budget, each half dollar a small luxury denied at the local piggly wiggly, until one day, jingling the shift and clink of the pig’s growing silver weight, she shook too hard, and as if the hoarded wealth of her future were too much to contain, the pig broke open—spilling coins like water, a cold shiny music, into her lap— fragments of bright pottery shards scattering delicate as easter eggshell.   3.sneeze  my mother sneezes in japanese.ké-sho! an exclamation of surprise—two sharp crisp syllables before pulling out the neatly folded and quartered tissue she keeps tucked inside the wrist of her sweater sleeve. sometimes, when ragweed blooms, i wonder why her sneeze isn’t mine, why something so involuntary, so deeply rooted in the seed of speech, breaks free from my mouth like thistle in a stiff breeze, in a language other than my mother’s tongue. how do you chart the diaspora of a sneeze?i don’t know how you turned out this way

 i. mother (1892-1973)  my mother, with a skin of crêpe de chine, predominantly yellow-colored, sheer enough to let the venous blue show through the secondarily bluish carapace, coughs, rasps, and rattles in her terminal dream, interrupted by lucidities, when, suctioned out and listening with hard ears almost waned to stone, she hears me say, “mother, we’re here. the two of us are here. anne’s here with me,” and she says, “anne is so— so pretty,” as if abdicating all her principalities of prettiness— so noted in her teens, when she smote all who saw her shake a leg upon the stage of vaudeville—and sinking into deeps where ancience lurks, and barebone toothlessness, and bareback exits from the centre ring of cynosure. of little, less is left when we leave: a stick figure of a once quite formidable personage. it is, therefore, no shock, when next day the call comes from my worn father, followed by the spade engaged upon hard january earth in bellevue cemetery, where he sways and cries for fifty years of joint returns unjointed, and plucks one carnation from the grave bouquet of springing flowers upon the medium-priced coffin of veneer, to press and keep as a venereal greenness brought forward from the greying past.   ii. father (1895-1974)  whether the rivals for a wife and mother can compose their differences and timely warp into concomitant currents, taken by the selfsame tide when taken at the flood— great waters poured black downhill at the height of melting in the middle of the night— is to be seen. we did not find it so. my father, whom i loved as if he’d done all his devoirs (though he had not), and shone upon my forehead like a morning sun, came home out of his hospital to stay in our rich, alien house, where trappings tried his niggard monkishness. four days he stayed in his ashen cocoon; the fifth he died under my ministrations, his pug jaw thrust out toward the port of hopelessness, where he (i hope) received the sirens of all possible welcoming tugs, even as i felt under his grey, waxen nose for breath and called the doctor to record a death that made shift rather easier for me, staring at nothing standing out to sea.   iii. tras os montes (197-)  1. in company  inspecting their kit and equipment at first light, i am glad the dawn is behind me, so my friends cannot reflect upon my tears. the province i move on across the mountains is still night- bound, deep beneath the reaches of the sun across the passes; so it will remain all of this long and dusty day, while we— will, joe, bob, jonathan, garth, peter, paul, ed, john, phil, harry, and a droptic me— march up the sunstruck slopes, dots on the rock that jags two thousand metres high ahead of us above the passes where the dead take formal leave of life: a kiss on both cheeks of the dear departing, medals stripped, with all due ceremony, from his breast, both epaulets cut loose from their braid stays, his sword, unbroken, pommelled in the hand of his reliever; lastly, a salute fired by the arms of officers, the guns of other ranks, and a flat bugle call played on a battered spanish instrument with ragged tassels as the body falls over the parapet—gaining weightlessness as its flesh deliquesces, as its bones shiver to ashes—into an air that crawls with all the arts of darkness far below.   2. a deux  a new scenario: on upswept slopes of ripe green wheat—rare in this country—we take, linked, a last long walk. in late july, the landscape waits, breath bated, on the whim of cumulonimbi in the west, which roll in with deceptive stealth, revealing a black heart cut with a cicatrice of fire, zigzagging to its ground: a naked peak kilometres away, a serra out of mind. i fix your face with a wax smile. our hands articulate our oneness, soon to dissipate, in a stiff splay of joints. is all the language at my tongue’s command too little to announce my stammered thanks for your unquestioning hand at my side, too much to say i know the lowly deuce is a poor card to play beside the ace, black with his curlicues and his strong pulse of sauve qui peut ambition? calling a spade a spade, i’m pierced with the extreme regret of one who dies intestate; as i’m snatched into the stormcloud from the springing field, from green to black, i spy on you, below, a lone maid in green wheat, and rain farewells and late apologies on your grey head, and thunder sorrows and regrets. the storm goes east, and the sun picks out my remains against the cloud: a tentative rainbow, an inverse, weak, and spectral kind of smile.   3. alone  the long march up the fulvous ridgebacks to the marches, the frontiers of difference— where flesh marches with bone, day marches with his wife the night, and country marches with another country—is accomplished best, by paradox, alone. a world of twos, of yangs and yins, of lives and objects, of sound grasses and deaf stones, is best essayed by sole infiltrators who have cast off their ties to living moorings, and stand out into the roads of noon approaching night casting a single shadow, earnest of their honorable intention to lay down their lives for their old country, humankind, in the same selfish spirit that inspired their lifelong journey, largely and at last alone, across the passes that divide a life from every other, the sheer crags of overweening will, the deepening scarps like brain fissures that cunningly cut off each outcrop from the main and make it one while its luck lasts, while its bravura holds against all odds, until the final climb across the mountains to the farther shore of sundown on the watersheds, where self, propelled by its last rays, sways in the sway of the last grasses and falls headlong in the darkness of the dust it is part of upon the passes where we are no more: where the recirculating shaft goes home into the breast that armed it for the air, and, as we must expect, the art that there turned our lone hand into imperial rome reverts to earth and its inveterate love for the inanimate and its return.  finis

 feygele is yiddish for the way i walk into a room. feygele, the anglicized spelling of angel fallen into the dark earthen pits of fashion. feygele from the german vögelein meaning “little bird.” little bird, where do you flame from? where do you bird from little german flame? little singlet split for entry. little finger slipped into the mouth staring hard across the bare wet bar. little bear in his arrogant leather harness, his broad american faith. carry me with you across the fleshless threshold how an old woman carries her language across an ocean so vast, so many fathoms deep one might imagine all life springing from the wet slit of its shoreline. sure i’ve memorized every word for faggot &amp; nearly all their origins are plural &amp; bound together with twine. little string corset wrapped around my brothers’ thighs. little horses wild at the bit to be ridden. little films where the animals are let out but only at night. sure i’ve eaten directly from the hand of a man who taught me the simplest words, gestures of thirst &amp; begging. sure i was hatched into a world that expected me to fly straight into power- lines. but see how hideous hearse-shined my feathers, see my wings spread like a dead book of legs, see my brutal beak a seed-thief in the club light. my first name was flame &amp; i drew moths &amp; mouths alike. feygele as in son of the first preacher with gills. as in the flood that began &amp; refused to quench. as in when i was a child i killed a bird, sparrow i think, with my bare hands so it wouldn’t go on suffering — it was sick. give me your hands, hold my skull between them how you’d hold a bag writhing with birds, a pillowcase thick with lights, two grown boys in gowns howling, a cold mud village consumed by flames, a cage door opening, a blade, a blade, ablaze.

 every time i use my language, i tell the truth. a cat in a white collar, like a priest with calico fur, walks across the dead grass of the yard, and out through the white fence. the sun’s strong, but the colors of the lawn were washed out by the winter, not the light. february. stained glass window of the house next door takes the sun’s full brunt. it must look spectacular to the neighbor in my head, a white-haired woman with an air of dignity and grace, who through pools of the intensest colors climbs the flight of stairs. i’ve never seen it, but i know it’s there.

 books are door-shaped portals carrying me across oceans and centuries, helping me feel less alone.  but my mother believes that girls who read too much are unladylike and ugly, so my father's books are locked in a clear glass cabinet. i gaze at enticing covers and mysterious titles, but i am rarely permitted to touch the enchantment of words.  poems. stories. plays. all are forbidden. girls are not supposed to think, but as soon as my eager mind begins to race, free thoughts rush in to replace the trapped ones.  i imagine distant times and faraway places. ghosts. vampires. ancient warriors. fantasy moves into the tangled maze of lonely confusion.  secretly, i open an invisible book in my mind, and i step through its magical door-shape into a universe of dangerous villains and breathtaking heroes.  many of the heroes are men and boys, but some are girls so tall strong and clever that they rescue other children from monsters.

 now the pink is in the water its wavy edges celebrated by cars &amp; guys with hands in pockets staring out. a woman chewing gum by the window of the train. which heaves its accordion on &amp; we move. they call it choo-choo because of the faint chooing sound as it starts. it's twee too &amp; dit dit dit eel &amp; screech. all this as the colors change. the buildings they bothered to paint white are pink like someone's awful socks were mistakenly washed. who owns this insidious red. the trees are black cause that's where the green goes. the girl who chews has fanned her fingers out below the glass and i long to stare at them. to count them one by one as the wires slip by. it's the sultriness, the smokey approach of the loss of light that i love. the homosexual lilac comes &amp; it's ours &amp; everyone like us. the bright compartment of white lights &amp; gleaming flip top &amp; yawns rage on. outside the hudson river queerness tools on my brain like a hopeless little wallet of feeling. a clear swipe to night. everyone in my compartment is tearing now. it's true, i heard two sheets at once get torn to pluck a brownie out. its smell oozes, &amp; the other one, god knows whose—to park her gum? her hands are holding her head, my silent partner's &amp; she's sleeping (deep in my gaze.) i look at her knees, the wrinkled foot just above the heel, a yellowish unmoody pink. the trees crowd the house &amp; finally we go fast finally it's not so warm on the train &amp; boats are sitting on purple sand the mountains are bland &amp; blue a woman's sigh is falling off, from on high and into her body. my partner's knees sway. someone says proust. or was it bruce. the train is rough. cutting through sweetness every night. i think "time." then "cargo."

 my words were sent underground to where the toggle switch detonates. that was the glare our voices were avoiding. there was something also   broken about the obedience of this retainer. the arcades weren’t semaphores just because the arrows leading there facilitated those   of us in line as though reliant on east or west quadrants. the ticket master was prone to elide requests from the travelers, the sliding doors   sounded a fanfare for the common man, get faster as thought, or mind the gaps. what i infer can never altogether establish a space adequate   to the body count. the platform motivates two guardians who were instructed in safekeeping to usher me from harm’s way but my stand   point so recedes from this tableaux as to acknowledge a footprint perspective. translucent envelope inside remaindered by the riptide   or such tunnel vision as to warrant arrest. why i was sent to the nether world inflicted with no wound. someone lets fall a pair of zip locks   containing the pixie sticks of this conspiracy; what i had to say was sent, i mentioned this i think already, underground switch and toggle   intended to ignite what i could never bring myself to mean. where the voices were avoiding me—hands outstretched at quarter day to hold   back the beam—was there something broken? i weather compliant. i rally.

 once, i was as large as any living creature could be.  i could lift the world and carry it from my breast to its bath.  when i looked down from the sky you could see the love in my eye:  “oh, tiny world, if anything ever happened to you, i would die.”  and i said, “no!” to the hand. snatched the pebble from the mouth, fished it out  and told the world it would choke! warned the world over &amp; over! “do  you hear me? do you want to choke?!”  but how was the world to know what the truth might be?perhaps  they grant you special powers, these choking stones. maybe

 when i wake, this is what i tell myself: i belong to this, to all the ghosts present  in the dna. diabetes, an ancient greek consort, sweeps through the halls  of my body. it seems the proper gift from my father, memory locked down in the cells  of my bladder. frequent urination is a hard nag to beat. my body  is my father's complaint. he rings at two in the morning. a piss in the pot, a shot  in the dark. he's never too far away.

 ye aspiring ones, listen to the story of the unknown who lies here with no stone to mark the place. as a boy reckless and wanton, wandering with gun in hand through the forest near the mansion of aaron hatfield, i shot a hawk perched on the top of a dead tree. he fell with guttural cry at my feet, his wing broken. then i put him in a cage where he lived many days cawing angrily at me when i offered him food. daily i search the realms of hades for the soul of the hawk, that i may offer him the friendship of one whom life wounded and caged.  
NEW POEM
 a hole torn in the fabric of the world, the web, the whole infernal weave through which life-giving rain is falling but mixing with the tears and with the blood. dead body-snatchers enter, the mega-corpses, much in the news these days, enter and grind bones, flesh and sinews down to dry tree bark, mixing with tree bark, crawling with the demonic beetles. they’ll tell it later: “no one expected this”: not one—patient, doctors, practitioners of every stripe, no one except the one whose daily work is close to prophecy, who feels it in his nerves or in her muscles—where news travels up fast and lodges in the eyes, all-seeing, all-pervading vision of disaster. and comes in like a mouse, wee small, [wee modest, so wee, wee practical,] mouse with big ears and popping eyes, looking this way and that and not one tittle-tattle fazed by your huge presence. later drowns in a bucket with a lizard: everything drowns round here getting to water. not able to get out again. thus coming quietly, thus probing, [thus stealing in,] squatting thus quietly back of the house: how do the tears well up, well down again, what makes them well, the seeing eyes know not, what routes the change parent-to-orphan? stop. orphan-to-parent? stop. then back again to tears? look out beyond the healthy trees preserved in a close circle round the house for privacy, look out the window over hills and dales of this milagro country, see living green, see dying brown—on each and every morning mourn the trees. criminal imbeciles who run the shows we live in from top to bottom of their slimy theater, have now decreed they will not solve the water. matter of fact, they will not solve what we are made of—the high percentage water in all of us compounded. they will not solve a single problem by the name of life we give to human business. they will prefer to dip their steel in blood, to let the semen drip from off of their steel into the blood and thus contaminate, infuse with every cancer both body politic and body not so politic, just private, single, individual—but gives to other individuals their mien and color. ghosts walk the hills and dales between the dying trees. “remember now,” they say, with stab at tragic countenance, [for when can privacy enter into collective?] “those days, those days you took no notice of, counting them poor, dispersing them among the memories you could not value at their true worth, you could not recognize enough to feel: who knows if these few days, [these very days], were not those ones we lived together here, the only paradise?”

 of mina-sarpilili-anda ii, the only surviving record is this splendid bas-relief in which he presses the neck of his hittite foe beneath one battle-shod foot while minions shoulder the spoils of a conquered city.  in fact there was no war that year; a bored stone-carver was looking for preferment. he received an allowance of good wine. in a perfumed cloud of dust that loitered over the plain, hittite ambassadors came to the king with golden bells and rosewater candy, birds in cages and spotted cats, and departed in peace. the king was beloved, laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed of poison.  a carnelian image of his second-best wife, accurate to the last mole, was plucked from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, on a ship that sank on a cloudless day. an image of his first wife, in chrysoprase, lies tightly packed in buried rubble for the next generation of archaeologists— should they prove worthy, persistent, and slyer than goatherds.

 the house is so quiet now the vacuum cleaner sulks in the corner closet, its bag limp as a stopped lung, its mouth grinning into the floor, maybe at my slovenly life, my dog-dead youth.  i’ve lived this way long enough, but when my old woman died her soul went into that vacuum cleaner, and i can’t bear to see the bag swell like a belly, eating the dust and the woolen mice, and begin to howl  because there is old filth everywhere she used to crawl, in the corner and under the stair. i know now how life is cheap as dirt, and still the hungry, angry heart hangs on and howls, biting at air.

 valentine, valentine you arrive in a town car with a chauffered envelope, scattered pieces of you enrolled in schoolyards like a recess of paper vanity, litter, old with red-rimmed "loves," red-rhymed lies in lace.  the verses come, rising as easily as long-stemmed snakes in bloom where swamps settle down and drowse by dawn, a night of secrets slid out of drawers like knives nesting, a choice of chimes and slums overrun by bejeweled heartbreakers. what a lovely winter, almost skipping february.

 here follows some verses upon the burning of our house, july 10th. 1666. copied out of a loose paper. in silent night when rest i took, for sorrow near i did not look, i wakened was with thund’ring noise and piteous shrieks of dreadful voice. that fearful sound of “fire” and “fire,” let no man know is my desire. i, starting up, the light did spy, and to my god my heart did cry to straighten me in my distress and not to leave me succourless. then, coming out, behold a space the flame consume my dwelling place. and when i could no longer look, i blest his name that gave and took, that laid my goods now in the dust. yea, so it was, and so ‘twas just. it was his own, it was not mine, far be it that i should repine; he might of all justly bereft but yet sufficient for us left. when by the ruins oft i past my sorrowing eyes aside did cast and here and there the places spy where oft i sate and long did lie. here stood that trunk, and there that chest, there lay that store i counted best. my pleasant things in ashes lie and them behold no more shall i. under thy roof no guest shall sit, nor at thy table eat a bit. no pleasant talk shall ‘ere be told nor things recounted done of old. no candle e'er shall shine in thee, nor bridegroom‘s voice e'er heard shall be. in silence ever shalt thou lie, adieu, adieu, all’s vanity. then straight i ‘gin my heart to chide, and did thy wealth on earth abide? didst fix thy hope on mould'ring dust? the arm of flesh didst make thy trust? raise up thy thoughts above the sky that dunghill mists away may fly. thou hast a house on high erect frameed by that mighty architect, with glory richly furnished, stands permanent though this be fled. it‘s purchased and paid for too by him who hath enough to do. a price so vast as is unknown, yet by his gift is made thine own; there‘s wealth enough, i need no more, farewell, my pelf, farewell, my store. the world no longer let me love, my hope and treasure lies above.

 exchange in greed the ungraceful signs. thrust the thick notes between green apple breasts. then the shadow of the devil descends, the violent space cries and angel eyes, large and dark, retreat in innocence and in ice. (run sister run–the bugga man comes!)  the violent space cries silently, like you cried wide years ago in another space, speckled by the sun and the leaves of a green plum tree, and you were stung by a red wasp and we flew home. (run sister run–the bugga man comes!)  well, hell, lil sis, wasps still sting. you are all of seventeen and as alone now in your pain as you were with the sting on your brow. well, shit, lil sis, here we are: you are i and this poem. and what should i do? should i squat in the dust and make strange markings on the ground? shall i chant a spell to drive the demon away? (run sister run–the bugga man comes!)  in the beginning you were the virgin mary, and you are the virgin mary now. but somewhere between nazareth and bethlehem you lost your name in the nameless void. “o mary don’t you weep don’t you moan” o mary shake your butt to the violent juke, absorb the demon puke and watch the white eyes pop, (run sister run–the bugga man comes!)  and what do i do. i boil my tears in a twisted spoon and dance like an angel on the point of a needle. i sit counting syllables like midas gold. i am not bold. i cannot yet take hold of the demon and lift his weight from you black belly, so i grab the air and sing my song. (but the air cannot stand my singing long.)

 a flashlight rolls over the walls of a cave, searching, until the transducer comes to a halt low on my still-flat belly. the doctor says, "there's definitely a kid in there."  easy for her to say—she sees this all day. but it took us years to get to this point. years in the dark. months of nothing and never. her expert eye interprets the grainy screen,  which i can't stop reaching toward, pretending to point to features but really just longing to touch the image, as if it were somehow more there than in me,  this tiny, blurry, leaping bison or bear, something from altamira or lascaux, from the hand of an ancestor— the first art we know.

 1   sometime after i had entered that time of   life people prefer to allude to in others but not in themselves, in the middle of the night the phone rang. it rang and rang as though the world needed me, though really it was the reverse.  i lay in bed, trying to analyze the ring. it had my mother’s persistence and my father’s pained embarrassment.  when i picked it up, the line was dead. or was the phone working and the caller dead? or was it not the phone, but the door perhaps?  2   my mother and father stood in the cold on the front steps. my mother stared at me, a daughter, a fellow female. you never think of us, she said.  we read your books when they reach heaven. hardly a mention of us anymore, hardly a mention of  your sister. and they pointed to my dead sister, a complete stranger, tightly wrapped in my mother’s arms.  but for us, she said, you wouldn’t exist. and your sister — you have your sister’s soul. after which they vanished, like mormon missionaries.  3   the street was white again, all the bushes covered with heavy snow and the trees glittering, encased with ice.  i lay in the dark, waiting for the night to end. it seemed the longest night i had ever known, longer than the night i was born.  i write about you all the time, i said aloud. every time i say “i,” it refers to you.  4   outside the street was silent. the receiver lay on its side among the tangled sheets, its peevish throbbing had ceased some hours before.  i left it as it was; its long cord drifting under the furniture.  i watched the snow falling, not so much obscuring things as making them seem larger than they were.  who would call in the middle of the night? trouble calls, despair calls. joy is sleeping like a baby.

 they were not traditionalists. they could bear the innovations of plot. they could not wait to landscape the plot. they had plans for a bed of pansies because pansies hardly ever die in a cold snap, because pansies are hardy despite the name. when they shoved the trowel into the soil it was with his hand on the handle and hers                                                                            adding force. they knew there were only nine types of people in the world and they knew which ones would close the deal. they knew the shirkers by sight. they had options. they knew about required communication. about how i feel and you feel. when there was a question of who did the dishes and who did the cat box, it was settled in-house and never required an outside contractor.  but the pansies got stem spot, leaf rot, and mildew. when they looked at their options it seemed there weren’t really that many after all. they swore to uphold the bonds and the principles and the yelling. they swore to oral sex. they dressed to the nines and they walked the aisle. they stood up and received the standard narration.

 it’s not so easy to smash the compass. to rely on the winds     the golden hum of herb kane clouds navigating the tips of these mountains.  it’s not so easy to modify the compass. to apologize when your brothers are spreading the sashimi and churning the shoyu mustard.  it’s not so easy to ignore the compass because it seems to have always been here in all its sextant glory     pointing distracting you from wākea’s blue teeth nibbling papa’s chest.  it’s not so easy     but it’s possible to say “aloha, for now” to family and friends pouring bags of ice into clean coolers before the big show.  to walk past uncle’s squid lū‘au bubbling green, to get in that car and drive, with nothing but a fistful of quarters for the library xerox machine.  it’s possible     because when those books slide across the counter and you walk to an empty table     the compass begins to shake and the needle is never the same    again.  with every turn of a pacific page you realize      pukas are being filled or new ones      uncovered. and the art of listening brings with it memories, of the physics of his hips and hands     when you first saw him cast that net     slicing the horizon.  the needle doesn’t like it when you flatten the cube to discover your kūpuna were always just around the corner    from where you sit      now. and the halftime show hasn’t even started, yet.  the time it takes to get from the third million-dollar commercial to the fifth     is equal to the time it takes to find the kānaka maoli name of the land that raised you     buried under the pavements     under the brand new      two-lane     fast food      drive-thru.  but what the compass really hates      what it’s really afraid of is when you see the lo‘i in the same way that you see that empty sunday afternoon library     when you finally see the moana in your kūpuna’s eye.  so now      when you return home and the cooler is empty and the sashimi spiral is nearly gone   unfurl those xerox copies across the dining table     consoling the cousins who lost money on the spread.  and as the compass repairs itself    as it always does it will feel the sting when it finds you       tomorrow with your back being warmed by the morning sun.

 in the dark evening, my father and i walk down the road to the old house where my grandmother lived, and we see through the door an old woman's feet lifted up, tired, on a footstool, still in her thick stockings, the feet with legs and stockings looking just like grandma's after bearing nine children who lived, standing, working all day, the kind of woman who made stacks of toast, platters of eggs for all of us each hot morning, did laundry, then lunch, supper, and worked with the animals or cleaning fish the rest of the day.  i want to go open that door as i did so many times in the past, remembering not to slam the screen, as everyone would yell although i am now also older and finite, the seams of myself coming apart.  how i wish i could go to that woman with her legs up and rub her feet, put liniment on her legs.  years have passed through the doors of that house, of memory, doors of the past and my father's eyes are sad, looking in, his own memories, not mine, thinking maybe of his mother and some of his old belongings, the stolen colt of his own father, the bracelet he gave me with his r.a. number.  her memories are unremembered, as my grandfather's, as those before them, i think of what this poem is about, only partly about memory, our many losses. and walking with my father i walk with my grandparents, among the first to be numbered: #1556, #1555.

 it has never been so easy to cry openly or to acknowledge children. never before could i walk directly to the center of an island city feeling the automatism of millions drawing one pious breath, shouldering the sunset, holding it up in the oily tree-line a while longer. years ago, i was never sad enough and nothing but a hotel that i could tear to pieces and reconstruct inside a shoebox felt like home. my parents died. their miserable possessions washed up in other hotels, dioramas of the febrile romantic.  i take my first lover, already gray at her temples and more reticent than shy, more tacit than admiring, to the bus stop by the jewish museum. we wait in the dark a long time. she does not kiss me. she hurries up out of the oily street onto the humming, fluorescent podium of the last bus where i see her a last time, not waving to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom we traduced years ago in our first kiss.  never deny the power of withdrawal. never doubt that thought and time make things small. never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed uncomprehending gesture. at childhood’s end, none can tell happiness from buoyancy. none of it made any difference— the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed, the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion. we are no more complicated than our great-grandparents who dreaded the hotel life. like them, we seek the refuge of warm days in january, a piety whose compulsion is to survive according to explicit laws no young woman adores or young man follows with darling hunger.

 for love—i would split open your head and put a candle in behind the eyes.  love is dead in us if we forget the virtues of an amulet and quick surprise.  
NEW POEM
 it is the twilight blue chevrolet, four doors with no power but the engine, whitewall tires, no padding on the dashboard, the car i drive on dates, park on dark lanes to ask for a kiss, now my hand goes along the fender, wiping every spot, the suds in the bucket, my father standing at the gate, poor and proud, tall and stout, a wise man,  a man troubled by a son gone missing in the head, drag racing his only car at night, traveling with hoodlums to leave the books for street life, naming mentors the men who pack guns and knives, a son gone missing from all the biblical truth, ten talents, prophecies, burning bushes, dirty cars washed on saturday morning.  he tells me not to miss a spot, to open the hood when i'm done so he can check the oil, the vital thing like blood, blood of kinship, blood spilled in the streets of baltimore, blood oozing from the soul of a son walking prodigal paths leading to gutters. years later i tell him the stories of what his brother-in-law did to me, and  he wipes a tear from the corner of his eye, wraps it in a white handkerchief for church, walks up the stairs with the aluminum crutch to scream at the feet of black jesus and in these brittle years of his old age we grow deeper, talk way after midnight, peeping over the rail of his hospital bed as we wash the twilight blue chevrolet.  
NEW POEM
 rich, honored by my fellow citizens, the father of many children, born of a noble mother, all raised there in the great mansion-house, at the edge of town. note the cedar tree on the lawn! i sent all the boys to ann arbor, all the girls to rockford, the while my life went on, getting more riches and honors— resting under my cedar tree at evening. the years went on. i sent the girls to europe; i dowered them when married. i gave the boys money to start in business. they were strong children, promising as apples before the bitten places show. but john fled the country in disgrace. jenny died in child-birth— i sat under my cedar tree. harry killed himself after a debauch, susan was divorced— i sat under my cedar tree. paul was invalided from over-study, mary became a recluse at home for love of a man— i sat under my cedar tree. all were gone, or broken-winged or devoured by life— i sat under my cedar tree. my mate, the mother of them, was taken— i sat under my cedar tree till ninety years were tolled. o maternal earth, which rocks the fallen leaf to sleep!

NEW POEM
 the workman made it; therefore it is not god —hosea hear the word of the lord, ye children of pittsburgh, of calistoga and tlaquepaque, ye hierophants and wishbones, teraphim and household plants, for i am a jealous god betrayed.  my lover, whom i uplifted, has fallen to other affections. weep for her outcast state, for i rescind her corn and her fields, her appetites and her husbands, her loom and the cloth of her weaving; yea, as she sleeps in her bed, i will crumble her idols of clay.  i will cause to burn in the night her barns filled with swallows, her caves of rodents and bats, her racks of sidereal dresses, her stacks of serpentine hats.  the velvet of her touch, once royal, i will scarify with my wrath. for i am a god betrayed; my love has reached into my weakness and turned my heart like a fist.  therefore, i will strip her naked and drive her into the field. in her body of filth and feathers, her blood of beasts and men, she is my desolation and a forgotten name.  for my cosmos is contracted. my first world slips from my hands. tell the people, my prophet hosea, that i loved her more than love, and she gave not love in return.  my anger flattens and spreads along the walls and windows. it glances from my mirrors and breaks the east wind’s bones. i was a god of such strength they could not guess my name. and this woman of human warmth suckled me like a child.  now i dwell with the mole, blindly, and my voice is thin as a gnat’s. i grieve what grinds in me, heavily. i am but a half note, half sung.

 they were sitting on the thin mattress he’d once rolled &amp; carried up the four floors to his room only to find it covered nearly all of the bare wood leaving just a small path alongside the wall  &amp; between them was the sack of oranges &amp; pears she’d brought its neck turned back to expose the colors of the fruit &amp; as she opened a bottle of wine he reached over to a tall stack of books &amp; pulled out the tao&amp; with a silly flourish handed it across the bed to her   she looked up &amp; simply poured the two squat water glasses half-full with wine &amp; then she took the book   reading silently   not aloud as he’d assumed &amp; suddenly he felt clearly she knew the way two people must come upon such an understanding together of course but separately as the moon &amp; the wave remain individually one  
NEW POEM
 at times it is like watching a face you have just met, trying to decide who it reminds you of— no one, surely, whom you ever hated or loved, but yes, somebody, somebody. you watch the face  as it turns and nods, showing you, at certain angles, a curve of the lips or a lift of the eyebrow that is exactly right, and still the lost face eludes you. now this face is talking, and you hear  a sound in the voice, the accent on certain words— yes! a phrase . . . you barely recall sitting outside, by a pool or a campfire, remarking a peculiar, recurring expression. two syllables,  wasn’t it? doorknob? bathroom? shawcross? what the hell kind of word is shawcross? a name; not the right one. a couple of syllables that could possibly be a little like something you may once have heard.  so the talk drifts, and you drift, sneaking glances, pounding your brain. days later a face occurs to you, and yes, there is a resemblance. that odd word, though, or phrase, is gone. it must have been somebody else.  yes, it’s like that, at times; something is, maybe; and there are days when you can almost say what it is.  
NEW POEM
 when the cultivators of corpses are busy seeding plague across vast acres of the land, choking schools and churches in the motley toxins of grief, breeding virile shoots of violence so soon verdant even fools fear to tread in their wake :: when all known tools of resistance are clutched in the hands of the vile like a wilting bouquet, cut from their roots, while  the disempowered slice smiles across their own faces and hide the wet knives in writhing thickets of hair for future use :: when breathing in the ashen traces of dreams deferred, the detonator’s ticking a queer echo that amplifies instead of fading :: when there- you-are is where-you-were and the sunset groans into the atlantic, setting blue fire to dark white bones.

 1  one man held the huge pig down and the other stuck an ice pick into the jugular, which is when we started to pay attention. the blood rose ten feet with force while the sow swam on its back as if to cut its own neck. its fatty back smacked the slippery cement while the assassins shuffled to keep their balance, and the bloody fountain rose and fell back and rose less and less high, until the red plume reentered the pig at the neck, and the belly collapsed and the pig face went dull.  2  i knew the pig was the butcher’s, whose game lived mainly behind our garage. sometimes turkeys, always roosters and sheep. once the windmill turned two days without stopping. the butcher would walk in his apron straight for the victim. the others would scratch and babble and get in the way. then the butcher would lead the animal to the back door of his shop, stopping to kill it on a stump. it was always evening, after closing. the sea breeze would be rising, cloaking the hour in brine.  3  the pig we saw slaughtered was more than twice anything shut up in the patch we trespassed to make havoc. since the butcher was italian, not jewish, that would be his pig. like the barber who carried a cigar box of bets to the stationery store, like the greek who made sweets and hid greek illegals, immigrant “submarines,” the butcher had a business, his business, by which he took from our hands the cleaver and serrated knife for the guts, and gave us back in butcher paper and outer layers of brown wrapping our lives for their cries.  4  hung up to drain, the great pig, hacked into portions, looked like a puzzle we could put together in the freezer to make a picture of a pig of course, a map, clothes or other things when we looked.

 he danced with tall grass for a moment, like he was swaying with a woman. our gun barrels glowed white-hot. when i got to him, a blue halo of flies had already claimed him. i pulled the crumbled photograph from his fingers. there's no other way to say this: i fell in love. the morning cleared again, except for a distant mortar &amp; somewhere choppers taking off. i slid the wallet into his pocket &amp; turned him over, so he wouldn't be kissing the ground.  
NEW POEM
 the weaver bird built in our house and laid its eggs on our only tree. we did not want to send it away. we watched the building of the nest and supervised the egg-laying. and the weaver returned in the guise of the owner. preaching salvation to us that owned the house. they say it came from the west where the storms at sea had felled the gulls and the fishers dried their nets by lantern light. its sermon is the divination of ourselves and our new horizon limits at its nest. but we cannot join the prayers and answers of the communicants. we look for new homes every day, for new altars we strive to rebuild the old shrines defiled by the weaver's excrement.

 a well there is in the west country, and a clearer one never was seen; there is not a wife in the west country but has heard of the well of st. keyne.  an oak and an elm-tree stand beside, and behind doth an ash-tree grow, and a willow from the bank above droops to the water below.  a traveller came to the well of st. keyne; joyfully he drew nigh, for from the cock-crow he had been travelling, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  he drank of the water so cool and clear, for thirsty and hot was he, and he sat down upon the bank under the willow-tree.  there came a man from the house hard by at the well to fill his pail; on the well-side he rested it, and he bade the stranger hail.  "now art thou a bachelor, stranger?" quoth he, "for an if thou hast a wife, the happiest draught thou hast drank this day that ever thou didst in thy life.  "or has thy good woman, if one thou hast, ever here in cornwall been? for an if she have, i'll venture my life she has drank of the well of st. keyne."  "i have left a good woman who never was here." the stranger he made reply, "but that my draught should be the better for that, i pray you answer me why?"  "st. keyne," quoth the cornish-man, "many a time drank of this crystal well, and before the angel summon'd her, she laid on the water a spell.  "if the husband of this gifted well shall drink before his wife, a happy man thenceforth is he, for he shall be master for life.  "but if the wife should drink of it first,— god help the husband then!" the stranger stoopt to the well of st. keyne, and drank of the water again.  "you drank of the well i warrant betimes?" he to the cornish-man said: but the cornish-man smiled as the stranger spake, and sheepishly shook his head.  "i hasten'd as soon as the wedding was done, and left my wife in the porch; but i' faith she had been wiser than me, for she took a bottle to church."

(b) the shrieks of children being torn from their mothers.  the protesting girl was shackled like: (a) a criminal. (b) a runaway slave.  liken it or not  —mckinney, texas, june 2015  
NEW POEM
 my memory of a perfect scent: pine, sage, and cypress; my friends' faith in the power of rough and winding paths to take me up a mountain and bring me back.  specimens plucked from that mountain's pastures: indian paintbrush, sego lily, ordinary wildflowers.  how i got them is a story of friendship and passion nancy, now a doctor, once a shy sophmore in college her husband mike, the second, better one, and their obsession with the great outdoors—hence an idaho address.  boise's northend is a throwback to neighborhoods american—nice homes next to two-story garden apartments down the street from a mansion. bikes and dogs and hand-pushed lawn mowers. where they dwell is a bungalow that spirits memphis, tennessee circa 1971:  the who blasting off a turntable, marijuana-scented air, boys with long hair, girls wearing their boyfriends' blue jeans, bourbon and acid. paperbacks, record albums, text books piled up—azaleas on the parkway; a howl of buzzing bees late spring just before graduation.  their bungalow has dueling computers and a real backyard. while nancy and mike's boxes are slowly being unpacked, their bicycles are carefully racked inside their front door.  everyone is a thief out west. if you leave your bikes on the porch they disappear. if you find water, someone else will divert it. there are those who fight about the wind. others the sun. all angling for rights—mineral, water, air—that only comes with political power.  oh, my friends who love to hike, to ski, to bike and me, they love are driving me from boise to ketchum through mountain and valley beauty.  high desert heat is clear, dry and when your body rises out of  a chilly car,  blam.  from there you enter another air conditioning zone: a general store at the edge of mountain lore.  this place has everything from bibles to good bourbon.  i almost bought a foot long sausage. i almost bought a gun. i did buy cowboy postcards, mostly made for fun. food and security. winter just over the ridge, four weeks hence.  i used to watch death valley days. death was hinted, but not shown—the wagon turned over, the wagon train a going.  o, those long-suffering white people fearful of indians and scared of bandits, desperate for shade, for water, for land flowing milk and honey.  hard-bitten men and sad-eyed women trekking. how grand those verdant acres were to be. what they got was land just green enough for wandering herds of long-horned beasts and no where to farm, no where to hide.  today, the wind machines whip around:                         big energy.  horses gambol and graze on that patch of land or this keen slope. no wheat and corn, not even dope grows here. but silver, gold, treasures unknown lode these mountains inviting speculation, misery, and bad legislation.  a few miles up from sun valley, we enter a trail. mike and nancy smile and cajole. straw hat and baseball cap attest to sun's plenty. their walking sticks to the rocks' ready challenge to ankles and limbs. our water pouches are overflowing. what were my friends thinking?  we slip and slide on the side of this mountain and step aside for the sculpted women in tank tops and biker shorts—trotting as fast as nancy and mike's favorite dog she runs ahead following the blonde beauties until all is shadow. we greet each other with glee.  i am the novice hiker. i am afraid of falling into thin air. one large black woman with a bum knee. what were they thinking?  she will love the smell. pine, sage, and cypress. she will love the sound. wind shakes aspens. water crinkles rock she will love the sight. wildflowers—whites, yellows, purples and reds: indian paintbrush, sego lily, the wily cinquefoil.  when friends give you what you need, what more can you ask? oh the pleasure in a mountain's power to quiet a panicked heart. the glade refined. hawk's home, wolf's dream, bears far away.  stewards of american beauty—these are the paths my friends make in wild places —the rise and fall of future walks.  i salute their obsession for idaho's red undulating hills. whose mountain ranges east to west like those in the himalayas  says a guidebook, but ours is a different story—in this young mountain, on these new hills, circumspect is the american west.  where people steal a drop of ore, a native flower, a piece of splendor day in and day out.

 you know, the white guy in the film version of raisin in the sun, pudgy balding head, who comes to tell the black family not to move to the white chicago suburb. the man who smiles with the knife, who is a knife, but fools them for a second, because they’re looking at him the way he expects them to look at him. later, as they mop up the blood, they replay what he said: that he was elected by his neighbors, because he’s the guy that can get his foot in the door, whipped and rumpled, like he’s been apologizing since he popped out of his mother’s womb, like he’s a close, personal friend of sorry.  he’s sorry now, in his wilted suit. this is the way the knife gets through the door, and he sits there, as they think, maybe he ain’t a knife in sheep clothes, baaa baaa, baaa; such a foolish-looking, goofy little white guy. a small part of them, quietly embarrassed they’re even thinking that about him. they can barely hold their manners in check, and that’s his trick, the trick of the knife you don’t see until you’re cut. and the strangest thing about this, the damn thing is how meek he still looks after he cuts, and cuts again. dun as a female robin, his tongue slices and whittles. he is singing the song of his brood; money if you stay, fire if you come, as they think: how did a white robe, a tinder cross, and goon’s club trot through their door? a pack of dobermans couldn’t have done a neater job, except that dobermans of course, never apologize.  
NEW POEM
 i learned from my mother how to love the living, to have plenty of vases on hand in case you have to rush to the hospital with peonies cut from the lawn, black ants still stuck to the buds. i learned to save jars large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole grieving household, to cube home-canned pears and peaches, to slice through maroon grape skins and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point. i learned to attend viewings even if i didn’t know the deceased, to press the moist hands of the living, to look in their eyes and offer sympathy, as though i understood loss even then. i learned that whatever we say means nothing, what anyone will remember is that we came. i learned to believe i had the power to ease awful pains materially like an angel. like a doctor, i learned to create from another’s suffering my own usefulness, and once you know how to do this, you can never refuse. to every house you enter, you must offer healing: a chocolate cake you baked yourself, the blessing of your voice, your chaste touch.

 what land have you cast from the blotted-out region of your face?  what nation stung by watermarks was filmed out of extinction and brought forth resembling frost?  what offspring must jump through the eye of birth to be winked at when covered with brick sweat?  what ache piled its planks on the corner pier, now crumbles onto motionless water, sniffed at by forest smoke?  what makes this song a string of beads seized by cement cracks when the camera climbs through the basement window—winter clouds coiling through its speckled lens?  what season cannot locate an eye in the dark of the sound of the sun gyrating into red ocher after i thought you noticed my language was half wren, half pigeon and, together, we spoke a wing pattern on the wall that was raised to keep “us” out, there where “calling” became “culling,” “distance” distanced, in a mere scrape of enamel on yellow teeth?  what father woke, turned over his wife, she didn’t want to, but he pushed until the baby leapt through, now, now, now, strummed into a chorus of burn marks on ceilings where police sirens fruit magpie skulls on trees of monsoon lightning?  what, what, what—is how that song chimed in wilderness.

 i. only now, in spring, can the place be named: tulip poplar, daffodil, crab apple, dogwood, budding pink-green, white-green, yellow on my knowing.   all winter i was lost. fall, i found myself here, with no texture my fingers know.   then, worse, the white longing that downed us deep three months.   no flower heat. that was winter.   but now, in spring, the buds flock our trees.   ten million exquisite buds, tiny and loud, flaring their petalled wings, bellowing from ashen branches vibrant keys, the chords of spring’s triumph: fisted heart, dogwood; grail, poplar; wine spray, crab apple. the song is drink, is color.   come.   now.   taste.  ii. the song is drink, is color.   come now, taste what the world has to offer.   when you eat you will know that music comes in guises— bold of crepe myrtle, sweet of daffodil— beyond sound, guises they never told you could be true.   and they aren’t.   except they are so real now, this spring, you know them, taste them. green as kale, the songs of spring, bright as wine, the music.   faces of this season grin with clobbering wantonness—see the smiles open on each branch?—until you, too, smile. wide carnival of color, carnival of scent.   we’re all lurching down streets, drunk now from the poplar’s grail.   wine spray: crab apple.  iii. from the poplar’s grail, wine spray.   crab apple brightens jealously to compete.   but by the crab apple’s deep stain, the tulip tree learns modesty.   only blush, poplar learns, lightly.   never burn such a dark-hued fire to the core.   tulip poplar wants herself light under leaf, never, like crab apple, heavy under tart fruit.   never laden. so the poplar pours just a hint of wine in her cup, while the crab apple, wild one, acts as if her body were a fountain. she would pour wine onto you, just let her. shameless, she plants herself, and delivers, down anyone’s street, bright invitations.  iv. down anyone’s street-bright invitations. suck ‘em.   swallow ‘em.   eat them whole.   that’s right, be greedy about it.   the brightness calls and you follow because you want to taste, because you want to be welcomed inside the code of that color: red for thirst; green for hunger; pink, a kiss; and white, stain me now.   soil me with touching.   is that right? no?   that’s not, you say, what you meant.   not what you meant at all?   pardon.   excuse me, please. your hand was reaching, tugging at this shirt of flowers and i thought, i guess i thought you were hungry for something beautiful. come now.   the brightness here might fill you up.  v. come.   now the brightness here might fill you up, but tomorrow?   who can know what the next day will bring.   it is like that, here, in spring. four days ago, the dogwood was a fist in protest.   now look.   even she unfurls to the pleasure of the season.   don’t be ashamed of yourself.   don’t be.    this happens to us all.   we have thrown back the blanket. we’re naked and we’ve grown to love ourselves. i tell you, do not be ashamed.   who is more wanton than the dancing crepe myrtle? is she ashamed?   why, even the dogwood, that righteous tree of god’s, is full of lust exploding into brightness every spring.  vi. exploding into brightness every spring, i draw you close.   i wonder, do you know how long i’ve wanted to be here?   each year you grasp me, lift me, carry me inside. glee is the body of the daffodil reaching tubed fingers through the day, feeling her own trumpeted passion choiring air with hot, colored song.   this is a texture i love.   this is life.   and, too, you love me, inhale my whole being every spring.   gone winter, heavy clod whose icy body fell into my bed.   i must leave you, but i’ll wait through heat, fall, freeze to hear you cry: daffodils are up.   my god, what beauty!  vii. daffodils are up, my god!   what beauty concerted down on us last night.   and if i sleep again, i’ll wake to a louder blossoming, the symphony smashing down hothouse walls, and into the world: music. something like the birds’ return, each morning’s crescendo rising toward its brightest pitch, colors unfurling, petals alluring. the song, the color, the rising ecstasy of spring.   my god.   this beauty.   this, this is what i’ve hoped for.   all my life is here in the unnamed core—dogwood, daffodil, tulip poplar, crab apple, crepe myrtle— only now, in spring, can the place be named.

 tonight i will remember the model with the wide, sad mouth who used to pose for father because i love the dangers of memory, the boarded window and door, rooms where one bare bulb makes shadows swell up the wall. and yet i recall only vaguely the way her hem rustled on the floor like sand against tin laisse-moi tranquille, epicier, it said because i want it to say something memorable. i want her back that brilliant, farfetched woman who drank coffee in our garden and the days father fed me absinthe through a sugar cube so i would be asleep by noon and wake to find ramona posing naked with a tambourine. tonight the whole world is a garden in which the immortal whispers something about art and its opportunities: memory like a bolt of silk in a tailor’s arms can be made into anything especially misfortune, especially the year ramona spent in a wrath almost biblical and so far from the world not even the moon could find her study in paris where the doors opened to the river.

 when i stop to consider my calling, remark the places a wayward temper impelled me i’ve found in light of where i wandered lost the most appalling evils could have befallen; but when i disregard the journey it’s hard to even fathom i endured so much affliction; what’s more, my days being spent, i feel i’ve seen my wariness go with them. i’ll come to my end, for i surrendered artless to someone with the science to dispel and destroy me if so inclined, else the know-how to want to; for if, with this very hand i could slaughter myself, why—not on my account but because so suited—would my enemy do otherwise?  …………………………………………………………………  cuando me paro a contemplar mi estado y a ver los pasos por do me han traído, hallo, según por do anduve, perdido, que la mayor mal pudiera haber llegado;  mas cuando del camino estó olvidado, a tanto mal no sé por dó he venido; sé que me acabo, y más he yo sentido ver acabar conmigo mi cuidado.  yo acabaré, que me entregué sin arte a quien sabrá perderme y acabarme si quisiere, y aún sabrá querello;  que, pues mi voluntad puede matarme, la suya, que no es tanto de mi parte, pudiendo, ¿qué hará sino hacello?

 —and when you have forgotten the bright bedclothes on a wednesday and a saturday, and most especially when you have forgotten sunday— when you have forgotten sunday halves in bed, or me sitting on the front-room radiator in the limping afternoon looking off down the long street to nowhere, hugged by my plain old wrapper of no-expectation and nothing-i-have-to-do and i’m-happy-why? and if-monday-never-had-to-come— when you have forgotten that, i say, and how you swore, if somebody beeped the bell, and how my heart played hopscotch if the telephone rang; and how we finally went in to sunday dinner, that is to say, went across the front room floor to the ink-spotted table in the southwest corner to sunday dinner, which was always chicken and noodles or chicken and rice and salad and rye bread and tea and chocolate chip cookies— i say, when you have forgotten that, when you have forgotten my little presentiment that the war would be over before they got to you; and how we finally undressed and whipped out the light and flowed into bed, and lay loose-limbed for a moment in the week-end bright bedclothes, then gently folded into each other— when you have, i say, forgotten all that, then you may tell, then i may believe you have forgotten me well.

 i.  sirs, in our youth you love the sight of us. older, you fall in love with what we’ve seen, would lose yourselves by living in our lives. i’ll spin you tales, play the arabian girl; working close, alone in the blond arena, flourish my cape, the cloth on the camera. for women learn to be a holy show.  i’ll tell you where i’ve been, not what i am: in rotterdam, womb where my people sprang, i find my face, my father, everywhere. new cousins i must stoop to greet, the get of tall, whey-colored burghers, sturdy dams, as children fed on tulip bulbs and dirt, tugged at dry dugs and sucked at winter’s rind.  my cousins, dwarfed by war! your forms rebuke the butcher and the bystander alike. to ease you i can’t shrink this big dutch frame got of more comfortable ancestors. but from my southern side i pluck a phrase, “i’ll carry you.” and it means “rest in me,” to hold you as i may, in my mind’s womb.  but snap the album, get the guidebook out! rotterdam: her raw, gray waterfront, zadkine’s memorial burning on the quay; this bronze is mortal, gaping in defeat, the form that wombed it split to let it be. it mends; he lurches up, in blood reborn, the empty heavens his eternal frame.   ii.  move to my room beside the golden horn where minarets strike fire against the sky. the architecture: breasts and phalluses. where are the words to say that words are lies? yeats lied. and here byzantium lies dead. constantinople? syllables in a text. istanbul. real. embalmed in dancing dust.  everywhere the dark-brown past gives way to the beige of progress, that wide vacant lot. turkey without coffee! endlessly we sip tea from bud vases, and i lust for the guide, a sultry, serious, pedantic boy in a tight brown suit, thirsting to get out of the triple city weighing on his mind.  oh, he was doomed, doomed like the dogs on dog island, in the sea, netted and dumped and exiled, left to die, then skinned. we heard imaginary canine howls, like the rustlings of a thousand gauzy girls, film-eyed cattle, perishing of ennui in abandoned harems where he guided me.  meanwhile the faithful, prostrate and intoning, stare into the light as blind as death, knowing for sure their end is instant heaven. we infidels concede them paradise, having seen heaven-as-harem, a eunuch god in charge: the virgin slowly fattening to blubber. love, become feminized, tickles like a feather.  the saints of art? sophia, that vast barn holds no small savior waiting to get born. the formal scribble on the assaulted walls— five hundred years of crossing out his name! some famous, glittering pebbles mark the place as god’s most grandiose sarcophagus. decay, decay. and the mind, a fetus, dies.   iii.  return me to the airfield near shanghai where i am very young: shy, apprehensive, seated like sheba on a baggage mountain waiting for the first adventure to begin. the train will glide through fields of rice and men, bodies like thongs, and glorious genitals, not alien as chinese, but adam-strange.  rejoiced by her first look at naked men, her soul swims out the window of the train! she goes where newborn daughters clog the creeks; bank-porticoes are strewn with starving rags. here the old dragon, china, thrashes, dying. but the ancient, virile music of the race is rising, drenched in gongs and howls of dogs  islanded, the sighs of walled-up women dreaming of peasants in their prisoning fields… but we break out of the harem of history! no longer that young foreigner on the train, i listen like a bird, although i ruminate like a cow, in my pale holland body, riven by love and children. these eyes are what they see.  come die with me in the mosques of rotterdam.  
NEW POEM
 the feverish room and that white bed, the tumbled skirts upon a chair, the novel flung half-open, where hat, hair-pins, puffs, and paints are spread;  the mirror that has sucked your face into its secret deep of deeps, and there mysteriously keeps forgotten memories of grace;  and you half dressed and half awake, your slant eyes strangely watching me, and i, who watch you drowsily, with eyes that, having slept not, ache;  this (need one dread? nay, dare one hope?) will rise, a ghost of memory, if ever again my handkerchief is scented with white heliotrope.

 anna kyle brown. osage. 1896-1921. fairfax, oklahoma.  because she died where the ravine falls into water.  because they dragged her down to the creek.  in death, she wore her blue broadcloth skirt.  though frost blanketed the grass she cooled her feet in the spring.  because i turned the log with my foot.  her slippers floated downstream into the dam.  because, after the thaw, the hunters discovered her body.   because she lived without our mother.  because she had inherited head rights for oil beneath the land.  she was carrying his offspring.  the sheriff disguised her death as whiskey poisoning.  because, when he carved her body up, he saw the bullet hole in her skull.  because, when she was murdered, the leg clutchers bloomed.  but then froze under the weight of frost.  during xtha-cka zhi-ga tze-the, the killer of the flowers moon.  i will wade across the river of the blackfish, the otter, the beaver.  i will climb the bank where the willow never dies.

NEW POEM
 tired of walking and checking the lines of the tourist train that trundles through this town, famous for its pottery and brackish dune pools once visited by st. george and his dragon, and the lady with her unicorn, i stopped by at a convenient place to sit and shuck my sweet corn and let the local men hang their gates from my eyes. all they could offer were other versions of myself: soft and sweaty, sick of the big car diet dished up by detroit and the cocktail-party and locker-room chatter i've had to tackle while touring this country's musky beaches.  choosing to drive to my next stop, i found perched upon a tall chalk cliff the statue of a broad-bodied chaser so large i could never easily handle him as a top. he'd been added on to so many times over the centuries, that it was only really possible to identify him by touch: a little more shy, perhaps, than other guys his age, an abstract clock-face jutting from the pack i could feel buckled around his waist, and such wee-wee nuts, he could only be named, i whispered,patience. i camped there in his shadow 'til noon the next day, and drove away leaving a few of my burnt bones there, behind.  
NEW POEM
 she goes out to hang the windchime in her nightie and her work boots. it’s six-thirty in the morning and she’s standing on the plastic ice chest tiptoe to reach the crossbeam of the porch,  windchime in her left hand, hammer in her right, the nail gripped tight between her teeth but nothing happens next because she’s trying to figure out how to switch #1 with #3.  she must have been standing in the kitchen, coffee in her hand, asleep, when she heard it—the wind blowing through the sound the windchime wasn’t making because it wasn’t there.  no one, including me, especially anymore believes till death do us part, but i can see what i would miss in leaving— the way her ankles go into the work boots as she stands upon the ice chest; the problem scrunched into her forehead; the little kissable mouth with the nail in it.  
NEW POEM
 you are my bread and the hairline noise of my bones you are almost the sea  you are not stone or molten sound i think you have no hands    this kind of bird flies backward and this love breaks on a windowpane where no light talks  this is not time for crossing tongues (the sand here never shifts)    i think tomorrow turned you with his toe and you will shine and shine unspent and underground  
NEW POEM
 at dawn wind out of the north, hailflecks, pebbly skates against windows. i lie thinking the drainspout’s drip comes again in the basement faucet where i am crying, a child betrayed by death’s new cardinal and the cat yawning on the porch where my grandmother found me.  risen now, i see the river full-bodied, its white wind-knotted hair swirling like hers. the polar hickory is naked as a saber recalled by a girl long gone in the gold sauce of apples. two leaves that might be cardinals returned tumble in the hard light at the brick fence. nothing moves in boxwood where gray soldiers lie.  among the last of them she walked, cupping apples, staining her white frock, who took a boy far back into the haze the shenandoah hills held where family stallions might walk aimless ground littered with purpling flesh beyond the cull of seasons. through a gate nailed with leather belts in my mind, i pass and enter the arthritic orchard tended by widows. what i gather wakes me to think  how bright on the tongue was the taste kept concealed, sustained, of flesh abiding, months beneath the wintering house floors. to reach this i must go down storm-worn stones and pick my steps past the sealed boxes of family debris, nightgowns, flannels, ribbons, birthspoons, a pair of dulled skates, flowers pressed in a moldy bible.  why is it we keep what we cannot bear to use, and can’t escape, shoving ourselves into shrunken rooms edged with old foolishness unforgiven and unforgotten? i fumble to the center and pull a yellow light down the ancient string still dependably there and stand, in my head, as she did, playfully asking where they went. i know, i know, i say back there in the dust where i’ve come again to look through tiny windows into skirts of boxwood, a morning  that sends me alive among gray soldiers at the house roots. i see also blue preserving jars full of slick pulpy flesh she has put up in a juice thick as blood. behind it all in dark eaves, baskets of apples, split pine boxes like generations steeping, undisturbed by the tick and groan of housepipes veining the overhead i leave. oh let me see her light bring back those stallion-feeders, little red handfuls of joy! look  how long i’ve slept, learning to walk straight into a dawn-silvered web where secret spiders spin ceaseless as the seasons. above me ice takes each room, i can hear feet pacing fretful halls, yet here i lift my face and puff back all the silk in the world. i hold every core peeled on this slab. my fingers claw the meat of family stillness, parting all the way to seeds.  oh widows of the air, fill me with your cidery, useless lying, those bladed hours you fed me the dark rotting dreams of your love.  
NEW POEM
 fly from me does all i would have stay, the blossoms did not stay, stayed not the frost in the yellow grass. every leash snapped, every contract void, and flying in the crows lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks yet inside me it never stops so i can’t tell who is chasing, who chased, i can sleep into afternoon and still wake soaring. so out come the bats, down spiral swifts into the chimneys, hey, i’m real, say the dream- figments then are gone like breath-prints on a window, handwriting in snow. whatever i hold however flies apart, the children skip into the park come out middle-aged with children of their own. your laugh over the phone, will it ever answer me again? too much flying, photons perforating us, voices hurtling into outer space, whitman out past neptune, dickinson retreating yet getting brighter. remember running barefoot across hot sand into the sea’s hovering, remember my hand as we darted against the holiday broadway throng, catching your train just as it was leaving? hey, it’s real, your face like a comet, horses coming from the field for morning oats, insects hitting a screen, the message nearly impossible to read, obscured by light because carried by mercury: i love you, i’m coming. sure, what fluttered is now gone, maybe a smudge left, maybe a delicate under- feather only then that too, yes, rained away. and when the flying is flown and the heart’s a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown hangs still as meat in a locker and eyesight is dashed-down glass and the mouth rust- stoppered, will some twinge still pass between us, still some fledgling pledge?  
NEW POEM
 i don’t know what to say to you, neighbor, as you shovel snow from your part of our street neat in your greek black. i’ve waited for chance to find words; now, by chance, we meet.  we took our boys to the same kindergarten, thirteen years ago when our husbands went. both boys hated school, dropped out feral, dropped in to separate troubles. you shift snow fast, back bent, but your boy killed himself, six days dead.  my boy washed your wall when the police were done. he says, “we weren’t friends?” and shakes his head, “i told him it was great he had that gun,” and shakes. i shake, close to you, close to you. you have a path to clear, and so you do.  
NEW POEM
 dark frost was in the air without, the dusk was still with cold and gloom, when less than even a shadow came and stood within the room.  but of the three around the fire, none turned a questioning head to look, still read a clear voice, on and on, still stooped they o’er their book.  the children watched their mother’s eyes moving on softly line to line; it seemed to listen too—that shade, yet made no outward sign.  the fire-flames crooned a tiny song, no cold wind stirred the wintry tree; the children both in faërie dreamed beside their mother’s knee.  and nearer yet that spirit drew above that heedless one, intent only on what the simple words of her small story meant.  no voiceless sorrow grieved her mind, no memory her bosom stirred, nor dreamed she, as she read to two, ’twas surely three who heard.  yet when, the story done, she smiled from face to face, serene and clear, a love, half dread, sprang up, as she leaned close and drew them near.  
NEW POEM
 my father once broke a man’s hand over the exhaust pipe of a john deere tractor. the man, rubén vásquez, wanted to kill his own father with a sharpened fruit knife, &amp; he held the curved tip of it, lightly, between his first two fingers, so it could slash horizontally, &amp; with surprising grace, across a throat. it was like a glinting beak in a hand, and, for a moment, the light held still on those vines. when it was over, my father simply went in &amp; ate lunch, &amp; then, as always, lay alone in the dark, listening to music. he never mentioned it.  i never understood how anyone could risk his life, then listen to vivaldi.  sometimes, i go out into this yard at night, and stare through the wet branches of an oak in winter, &amp; realize i am looking at the stars again. a thin haze of them, shining and persisting.  it used to make me feel lighter, looking up at them. in california, that light was closer. in a california no one will ever see again, my father is beginning to die. something inside him is slowly taking back every word it ever gave him. now, if we try to talk, i watch my father search for a lost syllable as if it might solve everything, &amp; though he can’t remember, now, the word for it, he is ashamed . . . if you can think of the mind as a place continually visited, a whole city placed behind the eyes, &amp; shining, i can imagine, now, its end— as when the lights go off, one by one, in a hotel at night, until at last all of the travelers will be asleep, or until even the thin glow from the lobby is a kind of sleep; &amp; while the woman behind the desk is applying more lacquer to her nails, you can almost believe that the elevator, as it ascends, must open upon starlight.  i stand out on the street, &amp; do not go in. that was our agreement, at my birth.  and for years i believed that what went unsaid between us became empty, and pure, like starlight, &amp; that it persisted.  i got it all wrong. i wound up believing in words the way a scientist believes in carbon, after death.  tonight, i’m talking to you, father, although it is quiet here in the midwest, where a small wind, the size of a wrist, wakes the cold again— which may be all that’s left of you &amp; me.  when i left home at seventeen, i left for good.  that pale haze of stars goes on &amp; on, like laughter that has found a final, silent shape on a black sky. it means everything it cannot say. look, it’s empty out there, &amp; cold. cold enough to reconcile even a father, even a son.

 i wish them cramps. i wish them a strange town and the last tampon. i wish them no 7-11.  i wish them one week early and wearing a white skirt. i wish them one week late.  later i wish them hot flashes and clots like you wouldn't believe. let the flashes come when they meet someone special. let the clots come when they want to.  let them think they have accepted arrogance in the universe, then bring them to gynecologists not unlike themselves.

 who e’er she be that not impossible she that shall command my heart and me;  wher e’er she lie, lock’d up from mortal eye in shady leaves of destiny;  till that ripe birth of studied fate stand forth and teach her fair steps to our earth;  till that divine idea take a shrine of crystal flesh, through which to shine;  meet you her, my wishes, bespeak her to my blisses, and be ye call’d my absent kisses.  i wish her beauty that owes not all his duty to gaudy tire, or glist’ring shoe-ty.  something more than taffeta or tissue can, or rampant feather, or rich fan.  more than the spoil of shop, or silkworm’s toil, or a bought blush, or a set smile.  a face that’s best by its own beauty drest, and can alone command the rest.  a face made up out of no other shop than what nature’s white hand sets ope.  a cheek where youth, and blood, with pen of truth write, what the reader sweetly ru’th.  a cheek where grows more than a morning rose, which to no box his being owes.  lips, where all day a lover’s kiss may play, yet carry nothing thence away.  looks that oppress their richest tires, but dress and clothe their simplest nakedness.  eyes, that displaces the neighbour diamond, and outfaces that sunshine, by their own sweet graces.  tresses, that wear jewels but to declare how much themselves more precious are.  whose native ray can tame the wanton day of gems, that in their bright shades play.  each ruby there, or pearl that dare appear, be its own blush, be its own tear.  a well-tam’d heart, for whose more noble smart love may be long choosing a dart.  eyes, that bestow full quivers on love’s bow, yet pay less arrows than they owe.  smiles, that can warm the blood, yet teach a charm, that chastity shall take no harm.  blushes, that bin the burnish of no sin, nor flames of aught too hot within.  joys, that confess virtue their mistress, and have no other head to dress.  fears, fond and flight as the coy bride’s when night first does the longing lover right.  tears, quickly fled, and vain, as those are shed for a dying maidenhead.  days, that need borrow no part of their good morrow from a forespent night of sorrow.  days, that in spite of darkness, by the light of a clear mind are day all night.  nights, sweet as they, made short by lovers’ play, yet long by th’ absence of the day.  life, that dares send a challenge to his end, and when it comes say, “welcome friend.”  sidneian showers of sweet discourse, whose powers can crown old winter’s head with flowers.  soft silken hours, open suns, shady bowers, ’bove all, nothing within that lours.  whate’er delight can make day’s forehead bright, or give down to the wings of night.  in her whole frame have nature all the name, art and ornament the shame.  her flattery, picture and poesy, her counsel her own virtue be.  i wish, her store of worth may leave her poor of wishes, and i wish—no more.  now if time knows that her whose radiant brows weave them a garland of my vows,  her whose just bays my future hopes can raise, a trophy to her present praise;  her that dares be what these lines wish to see: i seek no further, it is she.  ’tis she, and here, lo, i unclothe and clear my wishes’ cloudy character.  may she enjoy it, whose merit dare apply it, but modesty dares still deny it.  such worth as this is shall fix my flying wishes, and determine them to kisses.  let her full glory, my fancies, fly before ye; be ye my fictions; but her story.

NEW POEM
 after a nick cave “soundsuit” made from buttons and found vintage abacus when george washington became president in 1789 he had only one tooth in his head, a single premolar poking up from his gums. his dent- ures were fashioned from lead, gold wire springs, brass screws, the teeth of humans and cows, ele- phant ivory, and hippopotamus bone. it is a myth that he had false teeth made of wood. a mis- perception put forth by those misled by the hair- line fractures that ivory and bone possess. just as cherry wine will stain cloth with a rust-hued vein, washington’s fondness for dark wine blemished his teeth. the fractures eventually darkening, un- til resembling the grain in a piece of wood. the darkening of fractures is rather curious. the makeup of the flesh, the constitution of origin, the trackers of bloodlines thrown off the trail. it is difficult to determine what discolor- ations have tunneled their way through the body. spider veins climbing the back of my legs like a winding river mapping the trauma. an unspoken collective of ephemeral bits and bytes, suffering most eloquently preserved in the mouth. the skin of one’s teeth decides many a fate. a black woman’s incisor settling down inside a white man’s maw. overall, a quizzical look, an off-color joke about progress, the very blood a trick of the eye, an ocean blue on the outside of the skin, a blushing red if viewed just beneath the sheath.  •   a tooth is made up of the crown and the root, all the king’s men destined to revolt. there are many ways to worm your way inside, many open- ings in the body of an animal. some orifices gated with white entryways. a wooden portcullis, a pick- et fence, a laced corset secured tightly by a maid, a pointed geode just waiting to be pulled, the cavern wall glittering in the dark. sharp crystals ornament the cave’s jawbone.cave canem, quite naturally speak- ing. a hooded hole a place for some to hide or go seek. a toothless whistle the signal for the slave hunting bloodhounds, with canines fanged like water moccasins. the swamp mud gushing like the suppertime mush sloshing between the gums of a confederate soldier. the terror of limbs at odds with the self. in world war i, trench foot meant frequent amputations, the blade sliding like floss between each toe. some diseases attack the foot or mouth, gums left inflamed in the cross fire. a grieving mother wears dog tags around her neck. her son’s baby shoes and teeth cast in bronze. the pulp at the center is how the tooth receives nourishment, how it transmits signals to the brain. the forgetting makes the present tense possible. memory is the gravity of the mind. all the icebergs have started to melt, milky objects left hanging by a string, the doorknobs means to an end.  •   the keyboard’s toothy smile splayed wide, the flatlined cursor blinks impatiently on the screen, my fingers struggle to tap into word processing. i monitor all of the track changes. even the computer is a slave to death. its in- nards already bygone, its body obsolete upon year of purchase. i am a librarian, swimming the digital divide, my predecessor’s paddles — a mass of floppy disks in an office closet. they pile up like the teeth of slaves waiting for sale. an affluent businessman at the door, his hands panning the saliva for white gold. his fingers parting the cavity, pursed lips cooing, i need something of yours to call my own. the desire to chew and smile at will. my grandmother lost her mind before her teeth, lost the memories be- fore the enamel gave way to rot. my face has my mother’s abacus features. we are, in fact, diphyo- dont. in one lifetime we develop two sets of teeth. the missing space filled with air, a hollow exile before the native tongue. i pray my unborn child will have a gap. what the french call “dents du bonheur” or lucky teeth. the womb’s peephole is rather impressionable. i will fasten the buttons of time. i will take the baby’s body in my own, whisper a plea in its discriminating ear: try to keep your wits about you, my love. memory is about the future, not the past.

 a great light is the man who knows the woman he loves a great light is the woman who knows the man she loves and carries the light into room after room arousing the sleepers and looking hard into the face of each and then sends them asleep again with a kiss or a whole night of love and goes on and on until the man and woman who carry the great lights of the knowledge of the one lover enter the room toward which their light is sent and fit the one and the other torch in a high candelabrum and there is such light that children leap up unless the sea swallow them in the crossing or hatred or war against which do not pray only but be vigilant and set your hand to the work.

 it was the schooner hesperus, that sailed the wintry sea; and the skipper had taken his little daughtèr, to bear him company.  blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax, her cheeks like the dawn of day, and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds, that ope in the month of may.  the skipper he stood beside the helm, his pipe was in his mouth, and he watched how the veering flaw did blow the smoke now west, now south.  then up and spake an old sailòr, had sailed to the spanish main, "i pray thee, put into yonder port, for i fear a hurricane.  "last night, the moon had a golden ring, and to-night no moon we see!" the skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe, and a scornful laugh laughed he.  colder and louder blew the wind, a gale from the northeast, the snow fell hissing in the brine, and the billows frothed like yeast.  down came the storm, and smote amain the vessel in its strength; she shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed, then leaped her cable's length.  "come hither! come hither! my little daughtèr, and do not tremble so; for i can weather the roughest gale that ever wind did blow."  he wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat against the stinging blast; he cut a rope from a broken spar, and bound her to the mast.  "o father! i hear the church-bells ring, oh say, what may it be?" "'t is a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!" — and he steered for the open sea.  "o father! i hear the sound of guns, oh say, what may it be?" "some ship in distress, that cannot live in such an angry sea!"  "o father! i see a gleaming light, oh say, what may it be?" but the father answered never a word, a frozen corpse was he.  lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark, with his face turned to the skies, the lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow on his fixed and glassy eyes.  then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed that savèd she might be; and she thought of christ, who stilled the wave on the lake of galilee.  and fast through the midnight dark and drear, through the whistling sleet and snow, like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept tow'rds the reef of norman's woe.  and ever the fitful gusts between a sound came from the land; it was the sound of the trampling surf on the rocks and the hard sea-sand.  the breakers were right beneath her bows, she drifted a dreary wreck, and a whooping billow swept the crew like icicles from her deck.  she struck where the white and fleecy waves looked soft as carded wool, but the cruel rocks, they gored her side like the horns of an angry bull.  her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice, with the masts went by the board; like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank, ho! ho! the breakers roared!  at daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach, a fisherman stood aghast, to see the form of a maiden fair, lashed close to a drifting mast.  the salt sea was frozen on her breast, the salt tears in her eyes; and he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed, on the billows fall and rise.  such was the wreck of the hesperus, in the midnight and the snow! christ save us all from a death like this, on the reef of norman's woe!

 even when your friend, the radio, is still; even when her dream, the magazine, is finished; even when his life, the ticker, is silent; even when their destiny, the boulevard, is bare; and after that paradise, the dance-hall, is closed; after that theater, the clinic, is dark,  still there will be your desire, and hers, and his hopes and theirs, your laughter, their laughter, your curse and his curse, her reward and their reward, their dismay and his dismay and her dismay and yours—  even when your enemy, the collector, is dead; even when your counsellor, the salesman, is sleeping; even when your sweetheart, the movie queen, has spoken; even when your friend, the magnate, is gone.

 when the plowblade struck an old stump hiding under the soil like a beggar’s rotten tooth, they swarmed up &amp; mister jackson left the plow wedged like a whaler’s harpoon. the horse was midnight against dusk, tethered to somebody’s pocketwatch.  he shivered, but not the way women shook their heads before mirrors at the five &amp; dime—a deeper connection to the low field’s evening star. he stood there, in tracechains, lathered in froth, just stopped by a great, goofy calmness.  he whinnied once, &amp; then the whole beautiful, blue-black sky fell on his back.

 i drew solitude over me, on the long shore.  —robinson jeffers, “prelude”  for whoever does not afflict his soul through this day, shall be cut off from his people. —leviticus 23:29  what is a jew in solitude?

 the glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs with its electric gate, its perfected privacy is not what i mean the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in utah or the golan heights is not what i mean the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen is not what i mean  three thousand miles from what i once called home i open a book searching for some lines i remember about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside, something that bloomed and faded and was written down in the poet’s book, forever: opening the poet’s book i find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . .the hateful-eyed and human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them  robinson jeffers, multitude is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf, and the separate persons, stooped over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other must i argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have i a choice?  to wonder far from your own or those you have called your own to hear strangeness calling you from far away and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk to go to meet the stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind (the jew on the icy, rutted road on christmas eve prays for another jew the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:make those bea woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)  find someone like yourself.   find others. agree you will never desert each other. understand that any rift among you means power to those who want to do you in. close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger. but i have a nightmare to tell:   i am trying to say that to be with my people is my dearest wish but that i also love strangers that i crave separateness i hear myself stuttering these words to my worst friends and my best enemies who watch for my mistakes in grammar my mistakes in love. this is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me? if a cloud knew loneliness and fear, i would be that cloud.  to love the stranger, to love solitude—am i writing merely about privilege about drifting from the center, drawn to edges, a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is, who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his blackness jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   jew who has turned her back on midrash and mitzvah(yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as jew?)  solitude, o taboo, endangered species on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, i want a gun to defend you in the desert, on the deserted street, i want what i can’t have: your elder sister, justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true  and i ask myself, have i thrown courage away? have i traded off something i don’t name? to what extreme will i go to meet the extremist? what will i do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision far from the protection of those she has called her own? will i find o solitude your plumes, your breasts, your hair against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s singing yes, you are loved, why else this song? in the old places, anywhere?  what is a jew in solitude? what is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man? when the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea when leviathan is endangered and jonah becomes revenger when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded when our souls crash together, arab and jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?

 it’s the being alone, i think, the emails but not voices. dominicans be funny, the way we love to touch — every greeting a cheek kiss, a shoulder clap, a loud.  it gots to be my period, the bloating, the insurance commercial where the husband comes home after being deployed, the last of the gouda gone, the rejection letter, the acceptance letter, the empty inbox.  a dream, these days. to work at home is a privilege, i remind myself.  spend the whole fucking day flirting with screens. window, tv, computer, phone: eyes &amp; eyes &amp; eyes. the keys clicking, the ding of the  microwave, the broadway soundtrack i share wine with in the evenings.  these are the answers, you feel me? &amp; the impetus. the why. of when the manicurist holds my hand, making my nails a lilliputian abstract,  i close my fingers around hers, disrupting the polish, too tight i know then, too tight to hold a stranger, but she squeezes back &amp; doesn’t let go &amp; so finally i can.

NEW POEM
 the year’s twelve daughters had in turn gone by, of measured pace tho’ varying mien all twelve, some froward, some sedater, some adorn’d for festival, some reckless of attire. the snow had left the mountain-top; fresh flowers had withered in the meadow; fig and prune hung wrinkling; the last apple glow’d amid its freckled leaves; and weary oxen blinkt between the trodden corn and twisted vine, under whose bunches stood the empty crate, to creak ere long beneath them carried home. this was the season when twelve months before, o gentle hamadryad, true to love! thy mansion, thy dim mansion in the wood was blasted and laid desolate: but none dared violate its precincts, none dared pluck the moss beneath it, which alone remain’d of what was thine.  old thallinos sat mute in solitary sadness. the strange tale (not until rhaicos died, but then the whole) echion had related, whom no force could ever make look back upon the oaks. the father said “echion! thou must weigh, carefully, and with steady hand, enough (although no longer comes the store as once!) of wax to burn all day and night upon that hollow stone where milk and honey lie: so may the gods, so may the dead, be pleas’d!” thallinos bore it thither in the morn, and lighted it and left it.  first of those who visited upon this solemn day the hamadryad’s oak, were rhodope and acon; of one age, one hope, one trust. graceful was she as was the nymph whose fate she sorrowed for: he slender, pale, and first  lapt by the flame of love: his father’s lands were fertile, herds lowed over them afar. now stood the two aside the hollow stone and lookt with stedfast eyes toward the oak shivered and black and bare.  “may never we love as they loved!” said acon. she at this smiled, for he said not what he meant to say, and thought not of its bliss, but of its end. he caught the flying smile, and blusht, and vow’d nor time nor other power, whereto the might of love hath yielded and may yield again, should alter his.  the father of the youth wanted not beauty for him, wanted not song, that could lift earth’s weight from off his heart, discretion, that could guide him thro’ the world, innocence, that could clear his way to heaven; silver and gold and land, not green before the ancestral gate, but purple under skies bending far off, he wanted for his heir.  fathers have given life, but virgin heart they never gave; and dare they then control or check it harshly? dare they break a bond girt round it by the holiest power on high?  acon was grieved, he said, grieved bitterly, but acon had complied . . ’twas dutiful!  crush thy own heart, man! man! but fear to wound the gentler, that relies on thee alone, by thee created, weak or strong by thee; touch it not but for worship; watch before its sanctuary; nor leave it till are closed the temple-doors and the last lamp is spent.  rhodope, in her soul’s waste solitude, sate mournful by the dull-resounding sea, often not hearing it, and many tears had the cold breezes hardened on her cheek. meanwhile he sauntered in the wood of oaks, nor shun’d to look upon the hollow stone that held the milk and honey, nor to lay his plighted hand where recently ’twas laid opposite hers, when finger playfully advanced and pusht back finger, on each side. he did not think of this, as she would do if she were there alone.  the day was hot; the moss invited him; it cool’d his cheek, it cool’d his hands; he thrust them into it and sank to slumber. never was there dream divine as his. he saw the hamadryad. she took him by the arm and led him on along a valley, where profusely grew the smaller lilies with their pendent bells, and, hiding under mint, chill drosera, the violet shy of butting cyclamen, the feathery fern, and, browser of moist banks, her offspring round her, the soft strawberry; the quivering spray of ruddy tamarisk, the oleander’s light-hair’d progeny breathing bright freshness in each other’s face, and graceful rose, bending her brow, with cup  of fragrance and of beauty, boon for gods. the fragrance fill’d his breast with such delight his senses were bewildered, and he thought he saw again the face he most had loved. he stopt: the hamadryad at his side now stood between; then drew him farther off: he went, compliant as before: but soon verdure had ceast: altho’ the ground was smooth, nothing was there delightful. at this change he would have spoken, but his guide represt all questioning, and said,  “weak youth! what brought thy footstep to this wood, my native haunt, my life-long residence? this bank, where first i sate with him . . the faithful (now i know, too late!) the faithful rhaicos. haste thee home; be happy, if thou canst; but come no more where those whom death alone could sever, died.”  he started up: the moss whereon he slept was dried and withered: deadlier paleness spread over his cheek; he sickened: and the sire had land enough; it held his only son.

 a queer thing about those waters: there are no birds there, or hardly any. i did not miss them, i do not remember missing them, or thinking it uncanny.  the beach so-called was a blinding splinter of limestone, a quarry outraged by hulls. we took pleasure in that: the emptiness, the hardness of the light, the silence, and the water’s stillness.  but this was the setting for one of our murderous scenes. this hurt, and goes on hurting: the venomous soft jelly, the undersides. we could stand the world if it were hard all over.  
NEW POEM
 we stopped at a farmer’s house before parking at the dock that creaked over the river. rowboats for rent, five bucks an hour, twenty for the day. deep water: i knew a canvas bag  was in the trunk. i knew lunch would be roast beef sandwiches and hot stew from a thermos, chunks of carrot and potatoes cut by my mother who slept through the racket of our leaving.  while my father paid, i loaded the boat with our poles and tackle boxes, lead sinkers shaped like grey pears, raincoats and a case of beer. i was ten and i knew my dad would toss  that canvas bag into the aluminum boat with a thunk. we fish for gar with kittens, he’d yelled last night at my mother, and that was that. the rowboat slid from the dock, the occasional clunk of the first  six-pack clipped on the fish stringer, and i knew that i should take my time fastening the wire leader to the brass swivel, tying on those massive sinkers. i knew that the six-inch treble hook  would tremble in my hands, and when i was done, i knew what came next, a canvas bag, stiff kittens, blood. i tore two hooks through the side of a calico, yanked upward with a  sharp tug to lodge the third barb beneath the ribs. i dangled my fingers in cold water to wash them, then reared the rod back into a cast that splashed twenty feet from the boat.  he popped the third beer and finished baiting his hook. too deep for an anchor, we drifted, and far beneath, the gar cruised back and forth, their prehistoric snouts slicing the dark, bumping  our bait again and again until that fierce hunger i was learning said clamp down and take it.

 the turtle carries his house on his back. he is both the house and the person of that house. but actually, under the shell is a little room where the true turtle, wearing long underwear, sits at a little table. at one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor, like the controls of a steam shovel. it is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house. most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns. he leans on one elbow, and then the other. he crosses one leg, and then the other. finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps. if he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape. if he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits. he knows that children are careless, and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place, where he will relight his candle, take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns. then he’ll bury his head in his arms and sleep....that is, until another child picks up his house....

 my long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree toward heaven still, and there's a barrel that i didn't fill beside it, and there may be two or three apples i didn't pick upon some bough. but i am done with apple-picking now. essence of winter sleep is on the night, the scent of apples: i am drowsing off. i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight i got from looking through a pane of glass i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough and held against the world of hoary grass. it melted, and i let it fall and break. but i was well upon my way to sleep before it fell, and i could tell what form my dreaming was about to take. magnified apples appear and disappear, stem end and blossom end, and every fleck of russet showing clear. my instep arch not only keeps the ache, it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. and i keep hearing from the cellar bin the rumbling sound of load on load of apples coming in. for i have had too much of apple-picking: i am overtired of the great harvest i myself desired. there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. for all that struck the earth, no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, went surely to the cider-apple heap as of no worth. one can see what will trouble this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is. were he not gone, the woodchuck could say whether it's like his long sleep, as i describe its coming on, or just some human sleep.

 there are, of course, theories about the wide-eyed, drop-jawed fascination children have for them, about how, before he's learned his own phone number or address, a five-year-old can carry like a few small stones the latin tonnage of those names, the prefixes and preferences for leaf or meat.  my son recites the syllables i stumble over now, sets up figures as i did years ago in his prehistory. here is the green ski slope of a brontosaur's back, there a triceratops in full gladiator gear. from the arm of a chair a pterodactyl surveys the dark primeval carpet.  each has disappeared from time to time, excavated finally from beneath a cabinet or the sofa cushions, only to be buried again among its kind in the deep toy chest, the closed lid snug as earth. the next time they're brought out to roam the living room another bone's been found  somewhere, a tooth or fragment of an eggshell dusted off, brushing away some long-held notion about their life-span or intelligence, warm blood or cold. on the floor they face off as if debating the latest find, what part of which one of them has been discovered this time.  or else they stand abreast in one long row, side by scaly side, waiting to fall like dominoes, my son's tossed tennis ball a neon yellow asteroid, his shadow a dark cloud when he stands, his fervor for them cooling so slowly he can't feel it— the speed of glaciers, maybe, how one age slides into the next.

 to kill correctly takes calculation.  down to a science. arsenic cacodylic acid.  know water and rice on a cellular level.  make sure no surviving seed can be collected and planted.  because even a small seed assures survival.  because mortars, grenades and bombs cannot destroy a grain.  because our heart is made of seeds.  know what it takes to kill the seeds.  know what it takes to deprive the plant of water, to dehydrate it.  to be surrounded by love but unable to absorb it.

 i am inside someone who hates me. i look out from his eyes. smell what fouled tunes come in to his breath. love his wretched women.  slits in the metal, for sun. where my eyes sit turning, at the cool air the glance of light, or hard flesh rubbed against me, a woman, a man, without shadow, or voice, or meaning.  this is the enclosure (flesh, where innocence is a weapon. an abstraction. touch.

 ah! why, because the dazzling sun restored my earth to joy have you departed, every one, and left a desert sky?  all through the night, your glorious eyes were gazing down in mine, and with a full heart's thankful sighs i blessed that watch divine!  i was at peace, and drank your beams as they were life to me and revelled in my changeful dreams like petrel on the sea.  thought followed thought—star followed star through boundless regions on, while one sweet influence, near and far, thrilled through and proved us one.  why did the morning rise to break so great, so pure a spell, and scorch with fire the tranquil cheek where your cool radiance fell?  blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight, his fierce beams struck my brow; the soul of nature sprang elate, but mine sank sad and low!  my lids closed down—yet through their veil i saw him blazing still; and bathe in gold the misty dale, and flash upon the hill.  i turned me to the pillow then to call back night, and see your worlds of solemn light, again throb with my heart and me!  it would not do—the pillow glowed and glowed both roof and floor, and birds sang loudly in the wood, and fresh winds shook the door.  the curtains waved, the wakened flies were murmuring round my room, imprisoned there, till i should rise and give them leave to roam.  o stars and dreams and gentle night; o night and stars return! and hide me from the hostile light that does not warm, but burn—  that drains the blood of suffering men; drinks tears, instead of dew: let me sleep through his blinding reign, and only wake with you!

 the dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch. a strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree like a cry in the throat. the sky is clay for the child who is past being tired, who wanders in waist-deep grasses. gnats rise in a vapor, in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears.  the sun is an indistinct moon. frail sticks of grass poke her ankles, and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs like wet fingers. the musk and smell of air are as hot as the savory terrible exhales from a tired horse.  the parents are sleeping all afternoon, and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons. she hears their combined breathing and swallowing salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling like the sides of horses in the hot pasture.  at evening a breeze dries and crumbles the sky and the clouds float like undershirts and cotton dresses on a clothesline. horses rock to their feet and race or graze. parents open their shutters and call the lonely, happy child home. the child who hates silences talks and talks of cicadas and the manes of horses.

 even iron can put forth, even iron.  this is the iron age, but let us take heart seeing iron break and bud, seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.  the almond-tree, december's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.  the almond-tree, that knows the deadliest poison, like a snake in supreme bitterness.  upon the iron, and upon the steel, odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow, odd crumbs of melting snow.  but you mistake, it is not from the sky; from out the iron, and from out the steel, flying not down from heaven, but storming up, strange storming up from the dense under-earth along the iron, to the living steel in rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow setting supreme annunciation to the world.  nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith, iron-breaking, the rusty swords of almond-trees.  trees suffer, like races, down the long ages. they wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black, the alien trees in alien lands: and yet the heart of blossom, the unquenchable heart of blossom!  look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail, yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon from the small wound-stump.  even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.  and the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!  this is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix, bristling now with the iron of almond-trees  iron, but unforgotten, iron, dawn-hearted, ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.  see it come forth in blossom from the snow-remembering heart in long-nighted january, in the long dark nights of the evening star, and sirius, and the etna snow-wind through the long night.  sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted gethsemane into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour. oh, give me the tree of life in blossom and the cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!  something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights, some memory of far, sun-gentler lands, so that the faith in his heart smiles again and his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith, and the gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds, pearls itself into tenderness of bud and in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride a naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover, frail-naked, utterly uncovered to the green night-baying of the dog-star, etna's snow-edged wind and january's loud-seeming sun.  think of it, from the iron fastness suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust. think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling, with all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.  oh, honey-bodied beautiful one, come forth from iron, red your heart is. fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body, more fearless than iron all the time, and so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.  in the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill, hoar-frost-like and mysterious.  in the garden raying out with a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about with such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance, sword-blade-born.  unpromised, no bounds being set. flaked out and come unpromised, the tree being life-divine, fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core within iron and earth.  knots of pink, fish-silvery in heaven, in blue, blue heaven, soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied, red at the core, red at the core, knotted in heaven upon the fine light.  open, open, five times wide open, six times wide open, and given, and perfect; and red at the core with the last sore-heartedness, sore-hearted-looking.

 a flower needs to be this size to conceal the winter window, and this color, the red of a fiat with the top down, to impress us, dull as we've grown.  months ago the gigantic onion of a bulb half above the soil stuck out its green tongue and slowly, day by day, the flower itself entered our world,  closed, like hands that captured a moth, then open, as eyes open, and the amaryllis, seeing us, was somehow undiscouraged. it stands before us now  as we eat our soup; you pour a little of your drinking water into its saucer, and a few crumbs of fragrant earth fall onto the tabletop.

 nothing is the way you think it is going to be. take this little flower from me, and let it go into the way you think of it. and so it grows and is the face of daisy the cow speaking, she my young grandma growing and wearing a pink slip and who fell from the sky that was clear blue and pure all over the place you called home as it moved out from under you in the slow rotation of the sphere you call a star, a flower, a mind.

 the comet taught us how to watch the war. the comet contended that fire  is romantic and recommended we each behold it alone, envisioning out there somewhere our next lover, craning up at this same sky.  was the comet simply endeavoring to keep us divided, i asked it, and the comet  did not reply. then we discovered the men who wanted us dead were convening at night on the site where their hero  had been unceremoniously interred. and so we exhumed the guy, burned him up, and fed his ash to the rapids,  to be churned into marlstone and mud-rich air. good thinking. now he’s everywhere.

 it was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the sea, that a maiden there lived whom you may know by the name of annabel lee; and this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me.  i was a child and she was a child, in this kingdom by the sea, but we loved with a love that was more than love— i and my annabel lee— with a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven coveted her and me.  and this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom by the sea, a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling my beautiful annabel lee; so that her highborn kinsmen came and bore her away from me, to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea.  the angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me— yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, in this kingdom by the sea) that the wind came out of the cloud by night, chilling and killing my annabel lee.  but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we— of many far wiser than we— and neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee;  for the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams of the beautiful annabel lee; and the stars never rise, but i feel the bright eyes of the beautiful annabel lee; and so, all the night-tide, i lie down by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, in her sepulchre there by the sea— in her tomb by the sounding sea.

 1 in the evening haze darkening on the hills, purple of the eternal, a last bird crosses over, ‘flop flop,’ adoring only the instant.  2 nine years ago, in a plane that rumbled all night above the atlantic, i could see, lit up by lightning bolts jumping out of it, a thunderhead formed like the face of my brother, looking down on blue, lightning-flashed moments of the atlantic.  3 he used to tell me, “what good is the day? on some hill of despair the bonfire you kindle can light the great sky— though it’s true, of course, to make it burn you have to throw yourself in ...”  4 wind tears itself hollow in the eaves of these ruins, ghost-flute of snowdrifts that build out there in the dark: upside-down ravines into which night sweeps our cast wings, our ink-spattered feathers.  5 i listen. i hear nothing. only the cow, the cow of such hollowness, mooing down the bones.  6 is that a rooster? he thrashes in the snow for a grain. finds it. rips it into flames. flaps. crows. flames bursting out of his brow.  7 how many nights must it take one such as me to learn that we aren’t, after all, made from that bird that flies out of its ashes, that for us as we go up in flames, our one work is to open ourselves, to be the flames?

 through the black, rushing smoke-bursts, thick breaks the red flame; all etna heaves fiercely her forest-clothed frame.  not here, o apollo! are haunts meet for thee. but, where helicon breaks down in cliff to the sea,  where the moon-silver'd inlets send far their light voice up the still vale of thisbe, o speed, and rejoice!  on the sward at the cliff-top lie strewn the white flocks, on the cliff-side the pigeons roost deep in the rocks.  in the moonlight the shepherds, soft lull'd by the rills, lie wrapped in their blankets asleep on the hills.  —what forms are these coming so white through the gloom? what garments out-glistening the gold-flower'd broom?  what sweet-breathing presence out-perfumes the thyme? what voices enrapture the night's balmy prime?  'tis apollo comes leading his choir, the nine. —the leader is fairest, but all are divine.  they are lost in the hollows! they stream up again! what seeks on this mountain the glorified train?—  they bathe on this mountain, in the spring by their road; then on to olympus, their endless abode.  —whose proase do they mention? of what is it told?— what will be for ever; what was from of old.  first hymn they the father of all things; and then, the rest of immortals, the action of men.  the day in his hotness, the strife with the palm; the night in her silence, the stars in their calm.

 lately, too much disturbed, you stay trailing in me and i believe you. how could i not feel you were misspent, there by books stacked clean on glass, or outside the snow arriving as i am still arriving. if the explanations amount to something, i will tell you. it is enough, you say, that surfaces grow so distant. maybe you darken, already too much changed, maybe in your house you would be content where no incident emerges, but for smoke or glass or air, such things held simply to be voiceless. and if you mean me, i believe you. or if you should darken, this inwardness would be misspent, and flinching i might pause, and add to these meager incidents the words. some books should stay formal on the shelves. so surely i heard you, in your complication aware, snow holding where it might weightless rest, and should you fold into me—trackless, misspent, too much arranged—i might believe you but swiftly shut, lines of smoke rising through snow, here where it seems no good word emerges. though it is cold, i am aware such reluctance could lose these blinking hours to simple safety. here is an inwardless purpose. in these hours when snow shuts, it may be we empty, amounting to something. how could i not wait for those few words, which we might enter.

 side by side through the streets at midnight, roaming together, through the tumultuous night of london, in the miraculous april weather.  roaming together under the gaslight, day’s work over, how the spring calls to us, here in the city, calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!  cool to the wind blows, fresh in our faces, cleansing, entrancing, after the heat and the fumes and the footlights, where you dance and i watch your dancing.  good it is to be here together, good to be roaming, even in london, even at midnight, lover-like in a lover’s gloaming.  you the dancer and i the dreamer, children together, wandering lost in the night of london, in the miraculous april weather.

 now the summer air exerts its syrupy drag on the half-dark city under the strict surveillance of quotation marks.  the citizens with their cockades and free will drift off from the magnet of work to the terrible magnet of love.  in the far suburbs crenellated of cartesian yards and gin the tribe of mothers calls the tribe of children in  across the bluing evening. it’s the hour things get to be excellently pointless, like describing the alphabet.  yikes. it’s fine to be here with you watching the great events without taking part, clinking our ice as they advance  yet remain distant. like the baker always about to understand idly sweeping up that he is the recurrence of napoleon  in a baker’s life, always interrupted by the familiar notes of a childish song, “no more sleepy dreaming,” we float  casually on the surface of the day, staring at the bottom, jotting in our daybooks, how beautiful, the armies of autumn.

NEW POEM
 where two streams joined, we met by accident, sitting upon an outcropping of rock with only the intent of watching water flow beneath unwinding water. facing up-stream, she held a flower to the sun as i leaned back and found an arrowhead inside a crevice, which lay there as if someone had left it by intent as an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water swirling upon stone and thus transform the accident of meeting her— ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand— into stark fact as obdurate as rock. could i have called, "look at this arrowhead i just found here!" would she have thought "an accident, that's credible," or feared that my intent was sinister, and that the implication of the arrowhead, unlike the radiant white flower or the two streams merging into faster water, casting up colored spume, had been contrived by me, certain as rock that forms by geologic laws? she had to know an arrowhead is humanly designed with the intent to kill, though now it's harmless as a flower decorating someone's hair, or water organized into a garden fountain. an arrowhead can now be used as an adornment for a necklace like a flower in a painting where a stream leaps past a light-reflecting rock with nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident. and so our accidental meeting on the rock flowed by, a flower cast upon the water with intent unknown, and all that's left now is the arrowhead.

 a poem should be palpable and mute as a globed fruit,  dumb as old medallions to the thumb,  silent as the sleeve-worn stone of casement ledges where the moss has grown—  a poem should be wordless as the flight of birds.  *  a poem should be motionless in time as the moon climbs,  leaving, as the moon releases twig by twig the night-entangled trees,  leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves, memory by memory the mind—  a poem should be motionless in time as the moon climbs.  *  a poem should be equal to: not true.  for all the history of grief an empty doorway and a maple leaf.  for love the leaning grasses and two lights above the sea—  a poem should not mean but be.

 northern hemisphere it’s almost christmas. sunlight   withdrawing into its darkest shell of green coils ring by ring like a yellow snake in a tight burrow. the snake’s sleep maps an origin pinpoints the start of where morning lies — its polished skin a simple clock turning every so often leaving a scaled topography behind. but just as rain can fall sideways and eyes look aslant might a northern winter not widen light in the same way a snake exceeds its skin? last summer i stood over a sheath of snake in the bush. the tail tapered the head was marked with the shape and angle of invisible eyes. it could have been a hairnet or a ghost but it was quieter than that. it could have been laid out across a plate of vine leaves. a seamstress could have used it as tulle a fisherman as netting the desert salt as cracks. trees are empty on the sidewalk their fallen leaves layered and overlapping like shelves of ancient papyruses. one tree casts a long shadow two arms striking upwards as though piqued by pavement light. between the shadow lying flat and still and the tree standing long and tall there is an angle of forty-five degrees. there is icarus falling from blue to decimal to amber. the distance between north and south is mapped with the shape and angle of his eyes. the snake’s skin is colorless his eye invincible. the winter light is warm piercing darkness radiating a trajectory that points in all directions.  
NEW POEM
 as i one evening sat before my cell, methought a star did shoot into my lap. i rose and shook my clothes, as knowing well that from small fires comes oft no small mishap; when suddenly i heard one say, “do as thou usest, disobey, expel good motions from thy breast, which have the face of fire, but end in rest.”  i, who had heard of music in the spheres, but not of speech in stars, began to muse; but turning to my god, whose ministers the stars and all things are: “if i refuse, dread lord,” said i, “so oft my good, then i refuse not ev’n with blood to wash away my stubborn thought; for i will do or suffer what i ought.  “but i have also stars and shooters too, born where thy servants both artilleries use. my tears and prayers night and day do woo and work up to thee; yet thou dost refuse. not but i am (i must say still) much more obliged to do thy will than thou to grant mine; but because thy promise now hath ev’n set thee thy laws.  “then we are shooters both, and thou dost deign to enter combat with us, and contest with thine own clay. but i would parley fain: shun not my arrows, and behold my breast. yet if thou shunnest, i am thine: i must be so, if i am mine. there is no articling with thee: i am but finite, yet thine infinitely.”

 as if the moon could haul through you its tremor of light and stone, be cleared of sound. plough the mind's noise until it's a shine  in the purl of south-bending river that bears itself toward a blacker part of the forest. if you hum, hum through the motes of air, perhaps your nerves will find at last  a tone to which they will succumb. be still. be not so heavy-hearted for a moment. all is not a tomb, blind sarcophagus staring dumb, thwarted  pleasures nailed inside. these fireflies sweep their tracings on the evening. weep if you must, but board what falls away, abdomens flaring—  the brief, nomadic intervals.  
NEW POEM
 as the team’s head-brass flashed out on the turn the lovers disappeared into the wood. i sat among the boughs of the fallen elm that strewed an angle of the fallow, and watched the plough narrowing a yellow square of charlock. every time the horses turned instead of treading me down, the ploughman leaned upon the handles to say or ask a word, about the weather, next about the war. scraping the share he faced towards the wood, and screwed along the furrow till the brass flashed once more. the blizzard felled the elm whose crest i sat in, by a woodpecker’s round hole, the ploughman said. “when will they take it away?” “when the war’s over.” so the talk began— one minute and an interval of ten, a minute more and the same interval. “have you been out?” “no.” “and don’t want to, perhaps?” “if i could only come back again, i should. i could spare an arm. i shouldn’t want to lose a leg. if i should lose my head, why, so, i should want nothing more. . . . have many gone from here?” “yes.” “many lost?” “yes, a good few. only two teams work on the farm this year. one of my mates is dead. the second day in france they killed him. it was back in march, the very night of the blizzard, too. now if he had stayed here we should have moved the tree.” “and i should not have sat here. everything would have been different. for it would have been another world.” “ay, and a better, though if we could see all all might seem good.” then the lovers came out of the wood again: the horses started and for the last time i watched the clods crumble and topple over after the ploughshare and the stumbling team.

 below the gardens and the darkening pines the living water sinks among the stones, sinking yet foaming till the snowy tones merge with the fog drawn landward in dim lines. the cloud dissolves among the flowering vines, and now the definite mountain-side disowns the fluid world, the immeasurable zones. then white oblivion swallows all designs.  but still the rich confusion of the sea, unceasing voice, sombre and solacing, rises through veils of silence past the trees; in restless repetition bound, yet free, wave after wave in deluge fresh releasing an ancient speech, hushed in tremendous ease.

 a dirigible powered us through the first leg, traversing snow-capped mountains where goats leapt from crags, and men with wrinkled apples faces looked up, pointed.  smiling to cold air, i slept under a bear skin, touched your lips in the night.  on our pleasant soap bubble journey, we dropped baskets down each morning, hooked meats, cheeses; in later weeks, nothing. still, we took notes,  detailing the weather conditions, the migrating elk numbers and their steady decrease. northward by cracked compass, the sleet sheeting the balloon drove us low, then lower—  in time we cut through the ice, sank fathoms into the sea, chaperoned by seals that are not mermaids at all.  else you think this a hoax, know my hand— down here still—please send help.

 august is the cruelest month: never enough daylight, too much heat, no holidays and nothing matters except september’s  dawning responsibilities, but the august of 1994 i was holden caulfield, summer camp senior counselor for the junior trail  blazers, black and brown children two weeks shy of first, second, and third grade. nothing is as positive, as motivating a force within  one’s life as a school bus full of kids singing along to the local radio station blazing hip-hop and r&amp;b. (imagine this cherubic  chorus riding upstate to ini kamoze’s “here comes the hotstepper.” [“muuur-derah!”]) my workday is filled with hazards like chocolate  melted sticky swim trunk pockets, insistent sunburn, and the assorted rah rah of parental unsupervision, but those bus rides back from  upstate water parks and pools were my favorite times working. have you ever ridden in a cheesebus with ashy children asleep  against you, staring at sudden trees — more numerous than project windows — blurring along the highways like confusion giving way  to doubt, the heady smell of dried chlorine and musty towels lulling you into the soft timbre of a midwest falsetto? tell me  what it is to fall in love with a lightskin girl covering the isley brothers. i was not two weeks into 21 years old. i had yet  to wear a box cutter in my fifth pocket, or see a semi-automatic aimed at my center mass, to feel its dumbness against my spine.  my life was uncertain, save for its unlikely length under my control, like the pilot who falls short of what he says, what he says  he’s all about, all about. all my homeboys were still alive, just like aaliyah dana haughton, not yet an angel of the cruelest august,  begging a boy, who may not be in the mood to learn what he thinks he knows, to look beyond his world and try to find a place for her.

 brown gas-fog, white beneath the street lamps. cut off on three sides, all space filled with our bodies. bodies that stumble in brown airlessness, whitened in light, a mildew glare, that stumble hand in hand, blinded, retching. wanting it, wanting to be here, the body believing it’s dying in its nausea, my head clear in its despair, a kind of joy, knowing this is by no means death, is trivial, an incident, a fragile instant.    wanting it, wanting with all my hunger this anguish, this knowing in the body the grim odds we’re up against, wanting it real. up that bank where gas curled in the ivy, dragging each other up, strangers, brothers and sisters.    nothing will do but to taste the bitter taste. no life other, apart from.

 we can never be with loss too long. behind the warped door that sticks, the wood thrush calls to the monks, pausing upon the stone crucifix, singing: “i am marvelous alone!” thrash, thrash goes the hayfield: rows of marrow and bone undone. the horizon’s flashing fastens tight, sealing the blue hills with vermilion. moss dyes a squirrel’s skull green. the cemetery expands its borders— little milky crosses grow like teeth. how kind time is, altering space so nothing stays wrong; and light, more new light, always arrives.

 in the middle of rolling grasslands, away from lights, a moonless night untethers its wild polka-dots, the formations we can name competing for attention in a twinkling and crowded sky-bowl.  out from the corners, our eyes detect a maverick meteor, a transient streak, and lying back toward midnight on the heft of car hood, all conversation blunted, we are at once unnerved and somehow restored.  out here, a furrow of spring-fed river threads through ranches in the tens of thousands of acres. like cattle, we are powerless, by instinct can see why early people trembled and deliberated the heavens.  off in the distance those cattle make themselves known, a bird song moves singular across the horizon. not yet 2:00, and bits of comet dust, the perseids, startle and skim the atmosphere like skipping stones.  in the leaden dark, we are utterly alone. as i rub the ridges on the back of your hand, our love for all things warm and pulsing crescendos toward dawn: this timeless awe, your breath floating with mine upward into the stars.

 both lying on our sides, making love in spoon position when she’s startled, what’s that? she means the enormous ship passing before you— maybe not that large, is it a freighter  or a passenger ship? but it seems huge in the dark and it’s so close. that’s a poem you say, d. h. lawrence—have you built your ship of death, have you? o build your ship of death,  for you will need it. right here it would be good if there were a small orchestra on board, you’d hear them and say to her, that piece is called autumn,  that’s what the brave musicians played as the titanic went under—and then you could name this poem “autumn.” but no, the ship is silent, its white lights glow in the darkness.

 a touch of cold in the autumn night— i walked abroad, and saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge like a red-faced farmer. i did not stop to speak, but nodded, and round about were the wistful stars with white faces like town children.  
NEW POEM
 1  the autumn shade is thin. grey leaves lie faint where they will lie, and, where the thick green was, light stands up, like a presence, to the sky. the trees seem merely shadows of its age. from off the hill, i hear the logging crew, the furious and indifferent saw, the slow response of heavy pine; and i recall that goddesses have died when their trees died. often in summer, drinking from the spring, i sensed in its cool breath and in its voice a living form, darker than any shade and without feature, passionate, yet chill with lust to fix in ice the buoyant rim— ancient of days, the mother of us all. now, toward his destined passion there, the strong, vivid young man, reluctant, may return from suffering in his own experience to lie down in the darkness. in this time, i stay in doors. i do my work. i sleep. each morning, when i wake, i assent to wake. the shadow of my fist moves on this page, though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank, coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snake does as it must, and sinks into the cold.   2  nights grow colder. the hunter and the bear follow their tranquil course outside my window. i feel the gentian waiting in the wood, blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green stems of the amaryllis waiting in the garden. i know, as though i waited what they wait, the cold that fastens ice about the root, a heavenly form, the same in all its changes, inimitable, terrible, and still, and beautiful as frost. fire warms my room. its light declares my books and pictures. gently, a dead soprano sings mozart and bach. i drink bourbon, then go to bed, and sleep in the promethean heat of summer’s essence.   3  awakened by some fear, i watch the sky. compelled as though by purposes they know, the stars, in their blue distance, still affirm the bond of heaven and earth, the ancient way. this old assurance haunts small creatures, dazed in icy mud, though cold may freeze them there and leave them as they are all summer long. i cannot sleep. passion and consequence, the brutal given, and all i have desired evade me, and the lucid majesty that warmed the dull barbarian to life. so i lie here, left with self-consciousness, enemy whom i love but whom his change and his forgetfulness again compel, impassioned, toward my lost indifference, faithful, but to an absence. who shares my bed? who lies beside me, certain of his waking, led sleeping, by his own dream, to the day?   4  if i ask you, angel, will you come and lead this ache to speech, or carry me, like a child, to riot? ever young, you come of age remote, a pledge of distances, this pang i notice at dusk, watching you subside from tree-tops and from fields. mysterious self, image of the fabulous alien, even in sleep you summon me, even there, when, under his native tree, odysseus hears his own incredible past and future, whispered by wisdom, but by wisdom in disguise.   5  thinking of a bravura deed, a place sacred to a divinity, an old verse that seems new, i postulate a man mastered by his own image of himself. who is it says, i am? sensuous angel, vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished heir of an awareness other than his own? not these, but one to come? for there he is, in a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death, carrying bread and water to a quiet, placing ten sounds together in one sound: confirming his election, or merely still, sleeping, or in a colloquy with the sun.   6  snow and then rain. the roads are wet. a car slips and strains in the mire, and i remember driving in france: weapons-carriers and jeeps; our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud; our minds diverted from fear. we labor. overhead, a plane, berlin or frankfurt, now new york. the car pulls clear. my neighbor smiles. he is old. was this our wisdom, simply, in a chance, in danger, to be mastered by a task, like groping round a chair, through a door, to bed?   7  a dormant season, and, under the dripping tree, not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the past do with me as it will, i savor place and weather, air and sun. though hercules confronts his nature in his deed, repeats his purposes, and is his will, intact, magnificent, and memorable, i try the simplest forms of our old poverty. i seek no end appointed in my absence beyond the silence i already share.   8  i drive home with the books that i will read. the streets are harsh with traffic. where i once played as a boy amid old stands of pine, row after row of houses. lined by the new debris of wealth and power, the broken road. then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground. at last, in the minor hills, my father’s place, where i can find my way as in a thought— gardens, the trees we planted, all we share. a cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting. i see it, when i look up from the page.   9  in nameless warmth, sun light in every corner, bending my body over my glowing book, i share the room. is it with a voice or touch or look, as of an absence, learned by love, now, merely mine? annunciation, specter of the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what future. what vivid loss to come, you change the room and him who reads here. restless, he will stir, look round, and see the room renewed and line, color, and shape as, in desire, they are, not shadows but substantial light, explicit, bright as glass, inexhaustible, and true.   1o  my shadow moves, until, at noon, i stand within its seal, as in the finished past. but in the place where effect and cause are joined, in the warmth or cold of my remembering, of love, of partial freedom, the time to be trembles and glitters again in windy light. for nothing is disposed. the slow soft wind tilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge. the intimate cry, both sinister and tender, once heard, is heard confined in its reserve. my image of myself, apart, informed by many deaths, resists me, and i stay almost as i have been, intact, aware, alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.

 the batture’s water and sand disappear when water swells the river, heat’s portion of a northern winter. under willows cropped up since our last cow is dead and carried to the batture to be taken by the water clean into another season, we sit on green granite piled deep enough to keep the batture dry one more week.  we don’t say so but we wait for the swollen body to appear before us, we want the torn leg to distract us, the loose arm to show us where. we’ve always known which way the water runs, the differences among earth, air, water and whatever the horizon offers that is not actually there. we want to be the ones to identify the missing person. we count the reward we’d earn.  there is a family in southern minnesota keeping a closet of dry-cleaned suits, a mahogany high-boy of ironed shirts, folded undershorts and sweaters. in the ashtray that says welcome to nevada are the coins he left without thinking, the only clue which tells his family what they didn’t want to know, he might have known what he was doing.  we want to be the ones whose call is first in a series of related events which will end we hope in the family’s satisfaction with the coroner’s identification, and though it is old-fashioned and no longer done in this country, we’d like to think the pennies from his pocket will be mailed to the morgue, polished to their copper finish, pressed to float forever on his eyelids and make us take a second look as the light hits them and they beautifully glitter.  we think how glad we were when we first saw him he floated face down in the water which a few moments earlier had been snow his children sledded and slipped on. light beats gravity, lifts these young trees from the water. this is where we watch time, mark the spot across the water which is the red flag we hope calls us come across and save us. this is twenty-eight states.

NEW POEM
 tonight the bear comes to the orchard and, balancing on her hind legs, dances under the apple trees, hanging onto their boughs, dragging their branches down to earth. look again. it is not the bear but some afterimage of her like the car i once saw in the driveway after the last guest had gone. snow pulls the apple boughs to the ground. whatever moves in the orchard— heavy, lumbering—is clear as wind.  the bear is long gone. drunk on apples, she banged over the trash cans that fall night, then skidded downstream. by now she must be logged in for the winter. unless she is choosy. i imagine her as very choosy, sniffing at the huge logs, pawing them, trying each one on for size, but always coming out again.  until tonight. tonight sap freezes under her skin. her breath leaves white apples in the air. as she walks she dozes, listening to the sound of axes chopping wood. somewhere she can never catch up to trees are falling. chips pile up like snow when she does find it finally, the log draws her in as easily as a forest, and for a while she continues to see, just ahead of her, the moon trapped like a salmon in the ice.

NEW POEM
 i stood in a longhouse with a woman who may or may not be mohawk. some shift their opinions about her like meteorologists, as if her blood were a storm system tracked in its comings and goings. but the father of her two sons was, without question, seneca. we knew that, in haudenosaunee country, a father is to some degree irrelevant, that her own shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing certain, terminal conditions. she waited on an elder she called steam (warning i was not to call the elder woman by that name). steam (not steam) would observe the boys, understand their natures, give them their creator names defining their lives during the next ceremony. i confessed my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency- deficient community, and confessed that my clan mother, three hours away, did not know me well enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed a more casual ceremony. you find your name after a social misstep, a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. names offer the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder than theirs, no matter the truth.  our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. my name is not like steam (no one is forbidden to use it). no one calls me batman because of my status, my utility belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles, my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because i wore the cape to an older age than i should have, and could continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away any time soon. even kids who only know christian bale or michael keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood, still think batman is my name.  and this is why i have no memory for when or how you became the bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal. you soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth, and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings, black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.  what metaphor suits the night i left on the amtrak for chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood on the platform, watching those cars pull out, the night i wanted to leap from the train, stay?  i cannot invent new names for the ways we slow, struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures without measure, defy actuary numbers and because i have gone closer to the light than you have, the story is easier to craft and finesse than it should be.  pollination trails are smaller than those i’m forced to fly in, and lying in little rock, santa fe, manhattan, minneapolis, seattle, hotel rooms, the ellipse of your name trail winds me home, waiting, dusted in pollen and history.  
NEW POEM
 after twenty years of marriage, we walked out of the bush and on to a rough dirt road we followed till we saw a pond we might be able to get to. the ground was boggy and buzzing. the pond was thick with weed and slime. it was not the sort of pond anyone would swim in, but we did — picking and sliding into the water over the bog and bees, bees we suddenly noticed were everywhere, were settling on our hair as we swam, ducks turning surprised eyes our way. after twenty years of marriage what is surprising isn’t really so much the person you are with but to find yourselves so out of place in this scene, cold but not able to get out without stepping over bees, so many bees.  
NEW POEM
 one day the bees start wandering off, no one knows why. first one doesn’t come back, and then another and another, until those who are supposed to stay and guard the hive, those who are making the royal jelly and feeding it to the queen, those who form different parts of the great brain, must put down what it is they are doing and go off in search— having no choice, not if the hive is going to survive, and where do they go, each one vanishing, never to be seen again, off wandering in the wilderness, having forgotten how, forgotten what it was they were after, what it was that gave meaning, having known it at one time, now a veil drawn. is it that each one is a cell, a brain cell, and now they’re failing one by one, plaque to alzheimer’s, or the way the cells in the esophagus will begin to mimic the stomach if the acid is too intense, if you’re sleeping and the valve won’t close, a lifetime of eating and drinking the wrong things, those cells compensating, trying their best, but opening the door to those other cells, the wild ones, the ones that call those bees, out there, somewhere, lost, having nowhere to return at night, their search for nectar fruitful, their small saddlebags full, but no one to go home to, no home, no memory of home, it’s as if they’d stumbled into some alternate world, one looking like ours but just a glass width different, just a fraction of sunlight different, the patient waking up, finding herself wandering, someone leading her back to bed, but there is no bed. confusion of the hive, they call it, and the hive dies, each bee goes down, each light goes out, one by one, blinking out all over town, seen from a great height as the night ages, darkens, as you’re parked in your car with your own true love, until it’s just you two and the stars, until it’s just you.  
NEW POEM
 there is a two-headed goat, a four-winged chicken and a sad lamb with seven legs whose complicated little life was spent in hopland, california. i saw the man with doubled eyes who seemed to watch in me my doubts about my spirit. will it snag upon this aging flesh?  there is a strawberry that grew out of a carrot plant, a blade of grass that lanced through a thick rock, a cornstalk nineteen-feet-two-inches tall grown by george osborne of silome, arkansas. there is something grotesque growing in me i cannot tell.  it has been waxing, burgeoning, for a long time. it weighs me down like the chains of the man of lahore who began collecting links on his naked body until he crawled around the town carrying the last thirteen years of his life six-hundred-seventy pounds. each link or each lump in me is an offense against love.  i want my own lit candle lamp buried in my skull like the lighthouse man of chungking, who could lead the travelers home. well, i am still a traveler and i don’t know where i live. if my home is here, inside my breast, light it up! and i will invite you in as my first guest.  
NEW POEM
 mortal, if thou art beloved life's offences are removed; all the fateful things that checked thee, hearten, hallow, and protect thee. grow'st thou mellow? what is age? tinct on life's illumined page, where the purple letters glow deeper, painted long ago. what is sorrow? comfort's prime, love's choice indian summer clime. sickness!—thou wilt pray it worse for so blessed, balmy nurse. and for death! when thou art dying 'twill be love beside thee lying. death is lonesome? oh, how brave shows the foot-frequented grave! heaven itself is but the casket for love's treasure, ere he ask it,— ere with burning heart he follow, piercing through corruption's hollow. if thou art beloved, oh then fear no grief from mortal men.  
NEW POEM
 a clumsy hillock unmolded like a cake on the meadow in the laguna mountains. tough yellow-green grass growing up to a tree as thick as a tooth. in winter, on the road from san diego, thousands of cars crawl up to the snow and their passengers get out to investigate it and then drive, discoursing, back home. and that’s california, solemnly discharging its responsibilities.  meanwhile we breakfast on pancakes the size of a plate while the console radio goes on the blink. miss l’espagnole looks out from her frame on the wall, completely prepared (though for what it is impossible to say). her left arm is white and dips into a puddle of fire or a pile of cotton on fire. and each thing is severe: the house hemmed in by pepper trees and mexico (this one is white and in chula vista), and the paraphernalia strewn around home: a few magazines summing up politics, a matchbox with a lavender automobile on the cover, and a set of soldiers of several military epochs marching off to war on the raffia rug. unless, you’ve grown up amidst palm trees (and buildings that are either unbuilt, or hospitals) it’s impossible to appreciate a reasonable tree.  i sometimes consider the parrots that live in the zoo and are sold on the street in tijuana. colored like national flags, their heads are always cocked to pick up something behind them.  and unless you have lived in a place where the fog closes in like a face, it is impossible to be (even temporarily) relieved when it lifts to expose the freshly painted trim of the city, and it seems like a fine day for knowledge: sunlight sleeping on top of the rocks and lots of white clouds scudding by like clean sheets which, when the air in the bedroom is cold, you pull over your head and let the temperature slowly increase while you breathe. but california has only a coast in common with this.  
NEW POEM
 in a morning coat, hands locked behind your back, you walk gravely along the lines in your head. these others stand with you, squinting the city into place, yet cannot see what you see, what you would see —a vision of these paths, laid out like a star, or like a body, the seed vibrating within itself, breaking into the open, dancing up to stop at the end of the universe. i say your vision goes as far as this, the egg of the world, where everything remains, and moves, holding what is most against it against itself, moving, as though it knew its end, against death. in that order, the smallest life, the small event take shape. yes, even here at this point, amma's plan consumes you, the prefigured man, nommo, the son of god. i call you into this time, back to that spot and read these prefigurations into your mind, and know it could not be strange to you to stand in the dark and emptiness of a city not your vision alone. now, i have searched the texts and forms of cities that burned, that decayed, or gave their children away, have been picking at my skin, watching my hand move, feeling the weight and shuttle of my body, listening with an ear as large as god's to catch some familiar tone in my voice. now, i am here in your city, trying to find that spot where the vibration starts. there must be some mistake.  over the earth, in an open space, you and i step to the time of another ceremony. these people, changed, but still ours, shake another myth from that egg. some will tell you that beginnings are only possible here, that only the clamor of these drums could bring our god to earth. a city, like a life, must be made in purity.  so they call you, knowing you are intimate with stars, to create this city, this body. so they call you, knowing you must purge the ground.  “sir, suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in which the arms and tyranny of the british crown were exerted, with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a state of servitude: look back, i entreat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed; reflect on that time, in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential preservation; you cannot but acknowledge, that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar blessing of heaven.”  
NEW POEM
 early april and there’s a light-footed feel. nothing troubles from the darkened underbrush, and the sun’s late beauty daubs the green wood with yellows.  as if for you, a thrush rills, blue pieces of silver that will dry like watermarks. almost delicate, the hour around seven, a blown-glass bowl, edgeless and honed, made bespoke.  yet somewhere inside this evening hour, a man refutes: his fist will not burden the kitchen table. a wintered heart, hard as a knot of holly.  
NEW POEM
 never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe does the summer when i was seventeen come back to mind against my will, like a bird crossing  my vision. summer of moist nights full of girls and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation of the comic boundaries, defiances that never  failed or brought disaster. days on the backs and in the breath of horses, between rivers and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,  enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves over muscular water. all those things accepted, once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant  accepts the nipple, never come back to mind against the will. what comes unsummoned now, blotting out every other thought and image,  is a part of the past not so deep or far away: the time of poverty, of struggle to find means not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.  what returns are those moments in the diner night after night with each night's one cup of coffee, watching an old man, who always at the same hour  came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened his drawing pad. what did he fill it with? and where's he gone? those days, that studious worker,  hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light, that artist always in the same worn-out suit, are my nostalgia now. that old man comes back,  the friend i saw each day and never spoke to, because i hoped soon to disappear from there, as i have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.  
NEW POEM
 just then, encountering my ruddy face in the grand piano's cold black craquelure, it conjured the jack-o'-lantern moon dipping up over the roofs of the tenderloin.  only when i have done with the myths— the inner spill that triggers us to flame, breasts so sensitive a moment's touch will call down fever; the dark sea-lane  between limbic squall and the heart's harbour— will i picture you, just beyond innocence, lying stripped by a thrown-wide window, letting the cool breeze covet your ardour.  
NEW POEM
 a bird, came down the walk - he did not know i saw - he bit an angle worm in halves and ate the fellow, raw,  and then, he drank a dew from a convenient grass - and then hopped sidewise to the wall to let a beetle pass -  he glanced with rapid eyes, that hurried all abroad - they looked like frightened beads, i thought, he stirred his velvet head. -  like one in danger, cautious, i offered him a crumb, and he unrolled his feathers, and rowed him softer home -  than oars divide the ocean, too silver for a seam, or butterflies, off banks of noon, leap, plashless as they swim.  
NEW POEM
 1  one royal afternoon when i was young and easily surprised by uncles coming from the park at the command of nurses and of guards,  i wondered, over trees and ponds, at the sorry, rude walls and the white windows of the apartments.  “these,” said my uncle, “are the tallest houses.”   2  yes, in the spring of my joy when i was visibly affected by a gaitered bishop, large and unsteady in the flagged yard, guards, dogs and blackbirds fled on every hand.  “he is an old one,” said uncle, “the gaiters are real.”   3  rippled, fistfed windows of your dun high houses! then come cages made of pretty willows where they put the palace girls! green ducks wade slowly from the marble water. one swan reproves a saucy daughter.  i consider my own true pond, look for the beginning and the end. i lead the bishop down lanes and islands.   4  yes, in the windows of my first existence before my yawns became seasons, when nurses and uncles were sure, chinese fowl fought the frosty water startled by this old pontifex.  “no bridge” (he smiled between the budding branches), “no crossing to the cage of the paradise bird!”  astounded by the sermons in the leaves i cried, “no! no! the stars have higher houses!”  kicking the robins and ganders from the floor of his insular world the magic bishop leaned his blessing on the children.   5  that was the bold day when moved by the unexpected summons i opened all the palace aviaries as by a king’s representative i was appointed fowler.  
NEW POEM
 saturday i ran to mytilene.  bushes and grass along the glass-still way were all dabbled with rain and the road reeled with shattered skies.  towards noon an inky, petulant wind ravelled the pools, and rinsed the black grass round them.  gulls were up in the late afternoon and the air gleamed and billowed and broadcast flung astringent spray all swordy-silver. i saw the hills lie brown and vast and passive.  the men of mytilene waited restive until the yellow melt of sun. i shouted out my news as i sped towards them that all, rejoicing, could go down to dark.  all nests, with all moist downy young blinking and gulping daylight; and all lambs four-braced in straw, shivering and mild; and the first blood-root up from the ravaged beaches of the old equinox; and frangible robins' blue teethed right around to sun: these first we loudly hymned; and then the hour of genesis when the first moody firmament swam out of arctic chaos, orbed solidly as the huge frame for this cramped little swaddled creature's coming forth to slowly, foolishly, marvellously discover a unique estate, held wrapt away from all men else, which to embrace our world would have to stretch and swell with strangeness.  this made us smile, and laugh at last. there was rejoicing all night long in mytilene.

 stairs: a rushed flight down thirty-eight; french doors unlocked always.  always: a lie; an argument.  argument: two buck hunters circle a meadow’s edge.  edge: one of us outside bleeding.  bleeding: shards of glass; doors locked.  locked: carpet awash with blood.  blood: lift and drop; a sudden breeze.  breeze: its whistle through bone.  bone: the other was looking at —  bone: cradled to catch drips.  drips: quiet as a meadow fawn.  fawn: faces down each hunter each gun.  gun: again.  again: somebody call someone.  someone: almost always prefers forgetting.  forgetting: an argument; a lie.  lie: a meadow; a casement; a stair.

 dear love, where the red lillies blossomed and grew, the white snows are falling; and all through the wood, where i wandered with you, the loud winds are calling; and the robin that piped to us tune upon tune, neath the elm—you remember, over tree-top and mountain has followed the june, and left us—december.  has left, like a friend that is true in the sun, and false in the shadows. he has found new delights, in the land where he's gone, greener woodlands and meadows. what care we? let him go! let the snow shroud the lea, let it drift on the heather! we can sing through it all; i have you—you have me, and we’ll laugh at the weather.  the old year may die, and a new one be born that is bleaker and colder; but it cannot dismay us; we dare it—we scorn, for love makes us bolder. ah robin! sing loud on the far-distant lea, thou friend in fair weather; but here is a song sung, that’s fuller of glee, by two warm hearts together.

 just off the highway to rochester, minnesota, twilight bounds softly forth on the grass. and the eyes of those two indian ponies darken with kindness. they have come gladly out of the willows to welcome my friend and me. we step over the barbed wire into the pasture where they have been grazing all day, alone. they ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness that we have come. they bow shyly as wet swans. they love each other. there is no loneliness like theirs. at home once more, they begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness. i would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms, for she has walked over to me and nuzzled my left hand. she is black and white, her mane falls wild on her forehead, and the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear that is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist. suddenly i realize that if i stepped out of my body i would break into blossom.

 i met a courtier riding on the plain, well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed; i sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain my lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed: he saw my case, and then of courtesy did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in, because i did desire his company: but he corvetting way of me did win. what should i do, who was besteaded so? his horse stood still faster than mine could go.

 thel's motto  does the eagle know what is in the pit? or wilt thou go ask the mole: can wisdom be put in a silver rod? or love in a golden bowl? i  the daughters of mne seraphim led round their sunny flocks. all but the youngest; she in paleness sought the secret air. to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day: down by the river of adona her soft voice is heard: and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.  o life of this our spring! why fades the lotus of the water? why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile &amp; fall. ah! thel is like a watry bow. and like a parting cloud. like a reflection in a glass. like shadows in the water. like dreams of infants. like a smile upon an infants face, like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air; ah! gentle may i lay me down, and gentle rest my head, and gentle sleep the sleep of death. and gentle hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.  the lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass answer'd the lovely maid and said: i am a watry weed, and i am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales; so weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head. yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all. walks in the valley. and each morn over me spreads his hand saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lilly flower, thou gentle maid of silent valleys. and of modest brooks; for thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna: till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales: then why should thel complain,  why should the mistress of the vales of har, utter a sigh.  she ceasd &amp; smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.  thel answered. o thou little virgin of the peaceful valley. giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'ertired. thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments, he crops thy flowers. while thou sittest smiling in his face, wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints. thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume, which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs, revives the milked cow, &amp; tames the fire-breathing steed. but thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun: i vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?"  "queen of the vales," the lily answered, "ask the tender cloud, and it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky, and why it scatters its bright beauty thro' the humid air. descend, o little cloud, &amp; hover before the eyes of thel."  the cloud descended, and the lily bowd her modest head, and went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.  ii  "o little cloud," the virgin said, "i charge thee tell to me, why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away: then we shall seek thee but not find; ah, thel is like to thee. i pass away, yet i complain, and no one hears my voice."  the cloud then shew'd his golden head &amp; his bright form emerg'd, hovering and glittering on the air before the face of thel.  "o virgin, know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs where luvah doth renew his horses? look'st thou on my youth, and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more, nothing remains? o maid, i tell thee, when i pass away, it is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy: unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers, and court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent: the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun, till we arise link'd in a golden band, and never part, but walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers."  "dost thou o little cloud? i fear that i am not like thee; for i walk through the vales of har and smell the sweetest flowers, but i feed not the little flowers; i hear the warbling birds, but i feed not the warbling birds; they fly and seek their food; but thel delights in these no more, because i fade away, and all shall say, 'without a use this shining woman liv'd, or did she only live to be at death the food of worms?'"  the cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer'd thus:  "then if thou art the food of worms, o virgin of the skies, how great thy use, how great thy blessing! every thing that lives lives not alone, nor for itself; fear not, and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice. come forth, worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive queen."  the helpless worm arose, and sat upon the lily's leaf, and the bright cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.  iii  then thel astonish'd view'd the worm upon its dewy bed.  "art thou a worm? image of weakness, art thou but a worm? i see thee like an infant wrapped in the lily's leaf; ah, weep not, little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep. is this a worm? i see thee lay helpless &amp; naked, weeping, and none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's smiles."  the clod of clay heard the worm's voice, &amp; raisd her pitying head; she bow'd over the weeping infant, and her life exhal'd in milky fondness; then on thel she fix'd her humble eyes.  "o beauty of the vales of har! we live not for ourselves; thou seest me the meanest thing, and so i am indeed; my bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,  but he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head, and kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast, and says: 'thou mother of my children, i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away.' but how this is, sweet maid, i know not, and i cannot know; i ponder, and i cannot ponder; yet i live and love."  the daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil, and said: "alas! i knew not this, and therefore did i weep. that god would love a worm, i knew, and punish the evil foot that, wilful, bruis'd its helpless form; but that he cherish'd it with milk and oil i never knew; and therefore did i weep, and i complaind in the mild air, because i fade away, and lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot."  "queen of the vales," the matron clay answered, "i heard thy sighs, and all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but i have call'd them down. wilt thou, o queen, enter my house? 'tis given thee to enter and to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet."  iv  the eternal gates' terrific porter lifted the northern bar: thel enter'd in &amp; saw the secrets of the land unknown. she saw the couches of the dead, &amp; where the fibrous roots of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists: a land of sorrows &amp; of tears where never smile was seen.  she wanderd in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning dolours &amp; lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave, she stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground, till to her own grave plot she came, &amp; there she sat down, and heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit:  "why cannot the ear be closed to its own destruction? or the glistning eye to the poison of a smile? why are eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn, where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie? or an eye of gifts &amp; graces, show'ring fruits and coined gold? why a tongue impress'd with honey from every wind? why an ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? why a nostril wide inhaling terror, trembling, and affright? why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?"  the virgin started from her seat, &amp; with a shriek fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of har.

 where we’d recently lain, exchanging a kiss, stork consorted with crane, limpkin with ibis.  was this as much wedding as there would ever be, the fowls’ foot-webbing, the identificatory  ring around a throat? exchange of earth and air: not a vow but a vote of confidence a feather  might tip by a single scale ... that one’s a raconteur, so much salt in his tale; this one’s a countertenor,  lilting above the feast. the archon of his hectare — spotted — spotted least. here’s a little heckler ...  penciled seagull in the margin. following line by line the path you took, i imagine no print so fine.

 break, break, break, on thy cold gray stones, o sea! and i would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that arise in me.  o, well for the fisherman's boy, that he shouts with his sister at play! o, well for the sailor lad, that he sings in his boat on the bay!  and the stately ships go on to their haven under the hill; but o for the touch of a vanish'd hand, and the sound of a voice that is still!  break, break, break at the foot of thy crags, o sea! but the tender grace of a day that is dead will never come back to me.

 the lump on his neck that no collar could hide, and the charity of his presence there in the neighborhood each fall, door-to-door, standing in the swept porches, waiting for the housewives to answer.  the ugly, pitiable treeman, reddish and leathery from the sun. his baseball cap pulled tight over his head, the visor stiff as a beaver’s tail. year after year, the bowsaw with its wide teeth and the long-handled toppers were all  that announced his trade. and standing on the porch he advised nothing, though he coughed and hacked, covering his mouth with his sap-blackened fist and waited for the infrequent yes that sent him up the trunk and into the solid lap of the branches,  where he clipped and sawed the bony leafless rigging until the tree, all torso—lung and heart, ribs and hips and shoulders—, stood like a knotted goblet in the yard, a figure, as in allegory, of his own stunted self, rooted, alive.  my mother tried hard to convince us we were all children of god and that the sick and maimed, the poor, were creatures born to special destinies so unique we could not understand. but who could understand pain’s redemptiveness and how it rarely seemed  to translate into grace. the poor were always poor, the sick, sick—just as the treeman’s goiter did not respond to treatment, inscrutable, part of god’s plan, part of the unlovely element of love: the humbling, the pity, the scar of violence—  a craving too frightening to name, or too tender, the way the treeman bundled the trimmings in twine and hauled them to the alley. and as if he counted it his real work, leaned against the fence and with his fingers picked the dogged sap from the blade and with a file sharpened the teeth.

 we brought hannah home today in afternoon sun with a crisp chill in the air on a hill overlooking the bay.  two women with a child and a shovel and a frozen placenta wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a red plastic bag. hannah was brought into this world some say fourth others say fifth five days before. before we brought her home.  the weekend of rain softened the earth but the cold discouraged the shovel from denting more than the surface. i dug into the earth. the ground weakened beneath the strength i put into the shovel pounding the ground smooth and moist at first then cold and solid.  pounding the ground warmed my arms. i thought good thoughts for hannah and her mother and prayed for us all. remembering those who have passed on and those to be born and i thought of my children to be born and i thought of my father who has passed on.  breaking into the cold ground i thought of the day we brought my father home. dinétah winter had frozen the ground and the earth chipped like ice, slivers of crunchy cold beneath our feet. our bodies warmed by our work and the earth chipped like an old tree being chopped, taking hours to finish. our bodies tired from our work and the earth piled high beside the hole like the clouds and just as fluffy. our bodies natural returning to the ground.  i dug into the ground digging out earth that would nourish hannah digging out life that would embody hannah and soon a small hole appeared four feet deep.  there we stood two women with a child and a shovel and a frozen placenta wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a red plastic bag. the frozen mass of tissue and blood and life was placed in the small hole by hannah’s mother and i felt her heat tissue and blood and life squatting with bloodied hands and cold earth bringing hannah home.

 oblong, its jutted ends rounding into circles, the old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lip an inch below the terrace tiles. over the stagnant water slide reflections: the blue-green of coned yews; the purple and red of trailing fuchsias dripping out of marble urns; bright squares of sky ribbed by the wake of a swimming beetle. through the blue-bronze water wavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow. an arm flashes through the reflections, a breast is outlined with leaves. outstretched in the quiet water the statue of a goddess slumbers. but when autumn comes the beech leaves cover her with a golden counter-pane.

 "build me straight, o worthy master! stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, that shall laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"  the merchant's word delighted the master heard; for his heart was in his work, and the heart giveth grace unto every art. a quiet smile played round his lips, as the eddies and dimples of the tide play round the bows of ships, that steadily at anchor ride. and with a voice that was full of glee, he answered, "erelong we will launch a vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch, as ever weathered a wintry sea!" and first with nicest skill and art, perfect and finished in every part, a little model the master wrought, which should be to the larger plan what the child is to the man, its counterpart in miniature; that with a hand more swift and sure the greater labor might be brought to answer to his inward thought. and as he labored, his mind ran o'er the various ships that were built of yore, and above them all, and strangest of all towered the great harry, crank and tall, whose picture was hanging on the wall, with bows and stern raised high in air, and balconies hanging here and there, and signal lanterns and flags afloat, and eight round towers, like those that frown from some old castle, looking down upon the drawbridge and the moat. and he said with a smile, "our ship, i wis, shall be of another form than this!" it was of another form, indeed; built for freight, and yet for speed, a beautiful and gallant craft; broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast, pressing down upon sail and mast, might not the sharp bows overwhelm; broad in the beam, but sloping aft with graceful curve and slow degrees, that she might be docile to the helm, and that the currents of parted seas, closing behind, with mighty force, might aid and not impede her course.  in the ship-yard stood the master, with the model of the vessel, that should laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind wrestle! covering many a rood of ground, lay the timber piled around; timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak, and scattered here and there, with these, the knarred and crooked cedar knees; brought from regions far away, from pascagoula's sunny bay, and the banks of the roaring roanoke! ah! what a wondrous thing it is to note how many wheels of toil one thought, one word, can set in motion! there 's not a ship that sails the ocean, but every climate, every soil, must bring its tribute, great or small, and help to build the wooden wall!  the sun was rising o'er the sea, and long the level shadows lay, as if they, too, the beams would be of some great, airy argosy, framed and launched in a single day. that silent architect, the sun, had hewn and laid them every one, ere the work of man was yet begun. beside the master, when he spoke, a youth, against an anchor leaning, listened, to catch his slightest meaning. only the long waves, as they broke in ripples on the pebbly beach, interrupted the old man's speech. beautiful they were, in sooth, the old man and the fiery youth! the old man, in whose busy brain many a ship that sailed the main was modelled o'er and o'er again; — the fiery youth, who was to be the heir of his dexterity, the heir of his house, and his daughter's hand, when he had built and launched from land what the elder head had planned.  "thus," said he, "will we build this ship! lay square the blocks upon the slip, and follow well this plan of mine. choose the timbers with greatest care; of all that is unsound beware; for only what is sound and strong to this vessel shall belong. cedar of maine and georgia pine here together shall combine. a goodly frame, and a goodly fame, and the union be her name! for the day that gives her to the sea shall give my daughter unto thee!"  the master's word enraptured the young man heard; and as he turned his face aside, with a look of joy and a thrill of pride standing before her father's door, he saw the form of his promised bride. the sun shone on her golden hair, and her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, with the breath of morn and the soft sea air. like a beauteous barge was she, still at rest on the sandy beach, just beyond the billow's reach; but he was the restless, seething, stormy sea! ah, how skilful grows the hand that obeyeth love's command! it is the heart, and not the brain, that to the highest doth attain, and he who followeth love's behest far excelleth all the rest!  thus with the rising of the sun was the noble task begun, and soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds were heard the intermingled sounds of axes and of mallets, plied with vigorous arms on every side; plied so deftly and so well, that, ere the shadows of evening fell, the keel of oak for a noble ship, scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, was lying ready, and stretched along the blocks, well placed upon the slip. happy, thrice happy, every one who sees his labor well begun, and not perplexed and multiplied, by idly waiting for time and tide!  and when the hot, long day was o'er, the young man at the master's door sat with the maiden calm and still, and within the porch, a little more removed beyond the evening chill, the father sat, and told them tales of wrecks in the great september gales, of pirates coasting the spanish main, and ships that never came back again, the chance and change of a sailor's life, want and plenty, rest and strife, his roving fancy, like the wind, that nothing can stay and nothing can bind, and the magic charm of foreign lands, with shadows of palms, and shining sands, where the tumbling surf, o'er the coral reefs of madagascar, washes the feet of the swarthy lascar, as he lies alone and asleep on the turf. and the trembling maiden held her breath at the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, with all its terror and mystery, the dim, dark sea, so like unto death, that divides and yet unites mankind! and whenever the old man paused, a gleam from the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume the silent group in the twilight gloom, and thoughtful faces, as in a dream; and for a moment one might mark what had been hidden by the dark,  that the head of the maiden lay at rest, tenderly, on the young man's breast!  day by day the vessel grew, with timbers fashioned strong and true, stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, till, framed with perfect symmetry, a skeleton ship rose up to view! and around the bows and along the side the heavy hammers and mallets plied, till after many a week, at length, wonderful for form and strength, sublime in its enormous bulk, loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! and around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething caldron, that glowed, and overflowed with the black tar, heated for the sheathing. and amid the clamors of clattering hammers, he who listened heard now and then the song of the master and his men: —  "build me straight, o worthy master, staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, that shall laugh at all disaster, and with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"  with oaken brace and copper band, lay the rudder on the sand, that, like a thought, should have control over the movement of the whole; and near it the anchor, whose giant hand would reach down and grapple with the land, and immovable and fast hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! and at the bows an image stood, by a cunning artist carved in wood, with robes of white, that far behind seemed to be fluttering in the wind. it was not shaped in a classic mould, not like a nymph or goddess of old, or naiad rising from the water, but modelled from the master's daughter! on many a dreary and misty night, 't will be seen by the rays of the signal light, speeding along through the rain and the dark, like a ghost in its snow-white sark, the pilot of some phantom bark, guiding the vessel, in its flight, by a path none other knows aright!  behold, at last, each tall and tapering mast is swung into its place; shrouds and stays holding it firm and fast!  long ago, in the deer-haunted forests of maine, when upon mountain and plain lay the snow, they fell, — those lordly pines! those grand, majestic pines! 'mid shouts and cheers the jaded steers, panting beneath the goad, dragged down the weary, winding road those captive kings so straight and tall, to be shorn of their streaming hair, and naked and bare, to feel the stress and the strain of the wind and the reeling main, whose roar would remind them forevermore of their native forests they should not see again. and everywhere the slender, graceful spars poise aloft in the air, and at the mast-head, white, blue, and red, a flag unrolls the stripes and stars. ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, in foreign harbors shall behold that flag unrolled, 't will be as a friendly hand stretched out from his native land, filling his heart with memories sweet and endless!  all is finished! and at length has come the bridal day of beauty and of strength. to-day the vessel shall be launched! with fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, and o'er the bay, slowly, in all his splendors dight, the great sun rises to behold the sight.  the ocean old, centuries old, strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, paces restless to and fro, up and down the sands of gold. his beating heart is not at rest; and far and wide, with ceaseless flow, his beard of snow heaves with the heaving of his breast. he waits impatient for his bride. there she stands, with her foot upon the sands, decked with flags and streamers gay, in honor of her marriage day, her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, round her like a veil descending, ready to be the bride of the gray old sea.  on the deck another bride is standing by her lover's side. shadows from the flags and shrouds, like the shadows cast by clouds, broken by many a sunny fleck, fall around them on the deck.  the prayer is said, the service read, the joyous bridegroom bows his head; and in tears the good old master shakes the brown hand of his son, kisses his daughter's glowing cheek in silence, for he cannot speak, and ever faster down his own the tears begin to run. the worthy pastor — the shepherd of that wandering flock, that has the ocean for its wold, that has the vessel for its fold, leaping ever from rock to rock — spake, with accents mild and clear, words of warning, words of cheer, but tedious to the bridegroom's ear. he knew the chart of the sailor's heart, all its pleasures and its griefs, all its shallows and rocky reefs, all those secret currents, that flow with such resistless undertow, and lift and drift, with terrible force, the will from its moorings and its course. therefore he spake, and thus said he: —  "like unto ships far off at sea, outward or homeward bound, are we. before, behind, and all around, floats and swings the horizon's bound, seems at its distant rim to rise and climb the crystal wall of the skies, and then again to turn and sink, as if we could slide from its outer brink. ah! it is not the sea, it is not the sea that sinks and shelves, but ourselves that rock and rise with endless and uneasy motion, now touching the very skies, now sinking into the depths of ocean. ah! if our souls but poise and swing like the compass in its brazen ring, ever level and ever true to the toil and the task we have to do, we shall sail securely, and safely reach the fortunate isles, on whose shining beach the sights we see, and the sounds we hear, will be those of joy and not of fear!"  then the master, with a gesture of command, waved his hand; and at the word, loud and sudden there was heard, all around them and below, the sound of hammers, blow on blow, knocking away the shores and spurs. and see! she stirs! she starts, — she moves, — she seems to feel the thrill of life along her keel, and, spurning with her foot the ground, with one exulting, joyous bound, she leaps into the ocean's arms!  and lo! from the assembled crowd there rose a shout, prolonged and loud, that to the ocean seemed to say, "take her, o bridegroom, old and gray, take her to thy protecting arms, with all her youth and all her charms!"  how beautiful she is! how fair she lies within those arms, that press her form with many a soft caress of tenderness and watchful care! sail forth into the sea, o ship! through wind and wave, right onward steer! the moistened eye, the trembling lip, are not the signs of doubt or fear. sail forth into the sea of life, o gentle, loving, trusting wife, and safe from all adversity upon the bosom of that sea thy comings and thy goings be! for gentleness and love and trust prevail o'er angry wave and gust; and in the wreck of noble lives something immortal still survives!  thou, too, sail on, o ship of state! sail on, o union, strong and great! humanity with all its fears, with all the hopes of future years, is hanging breathless on thy fate! we know what master laid thy keel, what workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, who made each mast, and sail, and rope, what anvils rang, what hammers beat, in what a forge and what a heat were shaped the anchors of thy hope! fear not each sudden sound and shock, 't is of the wave and not the rock; 't is but the flapping of the sail, and not a rent made by the gale! in spite of rock and tempest's roar, in spite of false lights on the shore, sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, our faith triumphant o'er our fears, are all with thee, — are all with thee!

 as i in hoary winter’s night stood shivering in the snow, surpris’d i was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow; and lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near, a pretty babe all burning bright did in the air appear; who, scorched with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed as though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed. “alas!” quoth he, “but newly born, in fiery heats i fry, yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but i! my faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns, love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns; the fuel justice layeth on, and mercy blows the coals, the metal in this furnace wrought are men’s defiled souls, for which, as now on fire i am to work them to their good, so will i melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.” with this he vanish’d out of sight and swiftly shrunk away, and straight i called unto mind that it was christmas day.

 the voyage of st. brendan   books were brendan’s love. at number one, amazing tales, a vast compendium. within, he found the mathematic salmon, the manticore, the breath-defying dragon.  the dog-head folks, called cynocephali, a godless bunch who play the banjolele. the arctic tribes who worship tiger seals, their ice-hickle cities on wagon wheels.  the whale jasconius, its mountain-back all porcupined with oak, and elm, and ash. and inexpressible isle, its ruined fort with butterfly judges, heart’s grief court.  in time, this diet of ripe and rum detail weighed on brendan: he sickened, grew pale. he craved, instead, a simple common sense in keeping with his rule of abstinence.  “these things,” he cried, “are figments, folderols. the truth is here, at hand: a linnet’s carols, kerry mountains, christ upon his hook.” and brendan made a fire, and burnt his book.

 butter, like love, seems common enough yet has so many imitators. i held a brick of it, heavy and cool, and glimpsed what seemed like skin beneath a corner of its wrap; the décolletage revealed a most attractive fat!  and most refined. not milk, not cream, not even crème de la crème . it was a delicacy which assured me that bliss follows agitation, that even pasture daisies through the alchemy of four stomachs may grace a king's table.  we have a yellow bowl near the toaster where summer's butter grows soft and sentimental. we love it better for its weeping, its nostalgia for buckets and churns and deep stone wells, for the press of a wooden butter mold shaped like a swollen heart.

 at the mouth of the river, moon, stars, an arctic calm, the twin lights at the end of the piers revolving with the smoothness we expect of supernatural machinery.  seen from down here on the beach the harbored ocean slowly tilts, like a mirror discreetly manhandled by night from the giant room it was supposed to occupy forever.  the mind says now, but the stars on their angelic gimbals roll and fade, a tide of constellations breaking nowhere, every night about this time. strike up the band.  in the tumbledown bar, the singer has fallen from stardom and grace, but though her interests nowadays are wholly secular, she can still refer back to the angels,  and knowing that song, we share a moment with the saved before we leave to make the crossing. no captain, no ferry, but cross we shall, believe you me.

 the mind goes caw, caw, caw, caw, dark and fast. the orphan heart cries out, “save me. purchase me as the sun makes the fruit ripe. i am one with them and cannot feed on winter dawns.” the black birds are wrangling in the fields and have no kindness, all sinew and stick bones. both male and female. their eyes are careless of cold and rain, of both day and night. they love nothing and are murderous with each other. all things of the world are bowing or being taken away. only a few calves will be chosen, the rest sold for meat. the sound of the wind grows bigger than the tree it’s in, lessens only to increase.haw, haw the crows call, awake or asleep, in white, in black.  
NEW POEM
 smoketrees line the roadside, still-bare beech and poplar bouqueted with redbud and something rusty i can't name, march's odd autumnals —  one-church towns i'm glad not to be from, split-log strip mall with a porch where claire's beauty shop shares a sign with "antigues," where you study grace in magazines, and when dad dies you rename the family diner  new york new york. love is a means of travel, so you dye the linens pink and swan-fold napkins, holding peony in your mouth. sundays drive out to watch the ferry drag its lace.  coastward, easter-colored clapboard, the last generation's shanties hovering on narrow stilts above the velour drift of tide plain (mink from a distance,  muskrat up close), a drowsy instrumental music, flooded at dusk. beside the bridge, smooth brow of pewter. island of saplings blackened like a framed-up house.

 i prefer warm fur, a perfect fire to lie beside, a cozy lap where i can nap, an empty chair when she's not there. i want heat on my feet on my nose on my hide. no cat i remember dislikes december inside.

 you give me flowers resembling chinese lanterns.  you give me hale, for yellow. you give me vex.  you give me lemons softened in brine and you give me cuttlefish ink. you give me all 463 stairs of brunelleschi’s dome.  you give me seduction and you let me give it back to you. you give me you.  you give me an apartment full of morning smells—toasted bagel and black coffee and the freckled lilies in the vase on the windowsill. you give me 24-across.  you give me flowers resembling moths’ wings.  you give me the first bird of morning alighting on a wire. you give me the sidewalk café with plastic furniture and the boys with their feet on the chairs. you give me the swoop of homemade kites in the park on sunday. you give me afternoon-colored beer with lemons in it.  you give me d.h. lawrence, and he gives me pomegranates and sorb-apples.  you give me the loose tooth of california, the broken jaw of new york city. you give me the blue sky of wyoming, and the blue wind through it.  you give me an ancient city where the language is a secret everyone is keeping.  you give me a t-shirt that says all you gave me was this t-shirt. you give me pictures with yourself cut out.  you give me lime blossoms, but not for what they symbolize.  you give me yes. you give me no.  you give me midnight apples in a car with the windows down. you give me the flashbulbs of an electrical storm. you give me thunder and the suddenly green underbellies of clouds.  you give me the careening of trains. you give me the scent of bruised mint.  you give me the smell of black hair, of blond hair.  you give me apollo and daphne, pan and syrinx. you give me echo.  you give me hyacinths and narcissus. you give me foxgloves and soft fists of peony.  you give me the filthy carpet of an east village apartment. you give me seeming not to notice.  you give me an unfinished argument, begun on the manhattan-bound f train.  you give me paintings of women with their eyes closed. you give me grief, and how to grieve.  
NEW POEM
 the catalpa’s white week is ending there in its corner of my yard. it has its arms full of its own flowering now, but the least air spills off a petal and a breeze lets fall whole coronations. there is not much more of what this is. is every gladness quick? that tree’s a nuisance, really. long before the summer’s out, its beans, long as a stick, will start to shed. and every year one limb cracks without falling off and hangs there dead till i get up and risk my neck to trim what it knows how to lose but not to shed. i keep it only for this one white pass. the end of june’s its garden; july, its fall; all else, the world remembering what it was in the seven days of its visible miracle.  what should i keep if averages were all?  
NEW POEM
 it nuzzles oblivion, confuses itself with mud. a creature  of familiar taste, it ambushes from its nest of ooze the pond's  brighter fish, clears its palate with their eggs, lumbers fat  and stagnant into winter, lulled into dreams of light sinking until  light drowns, and all is as before.  
NEW POEM
 these are the seasons persephone promised as she turned on her heel— the ones that darken, till green no longer bandages what i feel.  now touches of gold stipple the branches, promising weeks of time to fade through, finding the footprints she left as she turned to climb.  
NEW POEM
 i worked the river’s slick banks, grabbling in mud holes underneath tree roots. you’d think it would be dangerous, but i never came up with a cooter or cottonmouth hung on my fingertips. occasionally, though, i leapt upright, my fingers hooked through the red gills of a mudcat. and then i thrilled the thrill my father felt when he burst home from fishing, drunk, and yelled, well before dawn,“wake up! come here!” he tossed some fatwood on the fire and flames raged, spat, and flickered. he held a four-foot mudcat.“i caught it!” he yelled.“i caught this monster!” at first, dream-dazed, i thought it was something he’d saved us from. by firelight, the fish gleamed wickedly. but father laughed and hugged me hard, pressing my head against his coat, which stank, and glittered where dried scales caught the light. for breakfast, he fried enormous chunks of fish, the whole house glorious for days with their rich stink. one scale stuck to my face, and as we ate he blinked, until he understood what made me glitter. he laughed, reached over, flicked the star off of my face. that’s how i felt —that wild!— when i jerked struggling fish out of the mud and held them up, long muscles shuddering on my fingers. once, grabbling, i got lost. i traced the river to the marsh, absorbed with fishing, then absorbed with ants. with a flat piece of bark, i’d scoop red ants onto a black-ant hill and watch. then i would shovel black ants on a red-ant hill to see what difference that would make. not much. and i returned to grabbling, then skimming stones. before i knew it, i’d worked my way from fresh water to salt, and i was lost. sawgrass waved, swayed, and swung above my head. pushed down, it sprang back. slashed at, it slashed back. all i could see was sawgrass. where was the sea, where land? with every step, the mud sucked at my feet with gasps and sobs that came so close to speech i sang in harmony with them. my footprints filled with brine as i walked on, still fascinated with the sweat bees, hornets, burrow bees; and, god forgive me, i was not afraid of anything. lost in sawgrass, i knew for sure just up and down. almost enough. since then, they are the only things i’ve had much faith in. night fell. the slow moon rose from sawgrass. soon afterward i heard some cries and answered them. so i was saved from things i didn’t want to be saved from. ma tested her green switch —zip! zip!— then laid it on my thighs, oh, maybe twice, before she fell, in tears, across my neck. she sobbed and combed my hair of cockleburs. she laughed as she dabbed alcohol into my cuts. i flinched. she chuckled. and even as a child, i heard, inside her sobs and chuckling, the lovely sucking sound of earth that followed me, gasped, called my name as i stomped through the mud, wrenched free, and heard the earth’s voice under me.  
NEW POEM
 it’s in the perilous boughs of the tree out of blue sky    the wind sings loudest surrounding me.  and solitude,   a wild solitude ’s reveald,   fearfully,   high     i’d climb into the shaking uncertainties,  part out of longing,   part     daring my self, part to see that widening of the world,   part  to find my own, my secret hiding sense and place, where from afar all voices and scenes come back  —the barking of a dog,   autumnal burnings, far calls,   close calls—   the boy i was calls out to me here the man where i am   “look!  i’ve been where you  most fear to be.”  
NEW POEM
 winter is fallen early on the house of stare; birds in reverberating flocks haunt its ancestral box; bright are the plenteous berries in clusters in the air.  still is the fountain’s music, the dark pool icy still, whereupon a small and sanguine sun floats in a mirror on, into a west of crimson, from a south of daffodil.  ’tis strange to see young children in such a wintry house; like rabbits’ on the frozen snow their tell-tale footprints go; their laughter rings like timbrels ’neath evening ominous:  their small and heightened faces like wine-red winter buds; their frolic bodies gentle as flakes in the air that pass, frail as the twirling petal from the briar of the woods.  above them silence lours, still as an arctic sea; light fails; night falls; the wintry moon glitters; the crocus soon will open grey and distracted on earth’s austerity:  thick mystery, wild peril, law like an iron rod:— yet sport they on in spring’s attire, each with his tiny fire blown to a core of ardour by the awful breath of god.

 welcome to texas, devin johnston, a windmill has your name— stubborn and american at off-rhyme to the arroyo-creased, angular region. bald, redheaded turkey buzzards eat a rabbit struck by what it only understood as supernatural. the birds bring to mind black grasshoppers that broke clacking into red-winged and rasping darts. and even as we drive secular sunlight polishes aluminum slantwise.

 i.  the face of chinatown returns its color, plucked from july's industrial steamer.  dry the cup! so we do.  four noodle shops on east broadway release their belches collectively. they breed in me a hankering for family life.  here, there's no logic to melons and spring onions exchanging hands. no rhythm to men's briefs clothes-pinned to the fire escape.  retirees beneath the manhattan bridge leak hearsay.  the woman in apartment #18 on bayard washes her feet in pot of boiled water each evening before bedtime. but every handful of weeks she lapses.  i lean into the throat of summer.  perched above these streets with whom i share verbs and adjectives.  ii.  faces knotted, bangs softened with grease. the east river pulls along a thread of sun.  while sunday slides in. again, in those plain trousers.  how the heat is driven off course. how one can make out the clarified vowels of bridges.  who’s keeping count of what’s given against what’s stolen?  there's nothing i can't trace back to my coarse immigrant blood.  uncles tipple wine on the streets of mott and bayard. night shifts meet day shifts in passing.  sweat seasons the body that labors.  and in each noodle shop, bowls dusted with salt.

 how should i now recall the icy lace of the pane like a sheet of cellophane, or the skies of alcohol  poured over the saltbox town? on that stony new england tableau, the halo of falling snow glared like a waxy crown.  through blue frozen lots my giant parents strolled, wrapped tight against the cold like woolen argonauts,  searching for that tall perfection of scotch pine from the hundreds laid in line like the dead at guadalcanal.  the clapboard village aglow that starry stark december i barely now remember, or the brutish ache of snow  burning my face like quicklime. yet one thing was still missing. i saw my parents kissing, perhaps for the last time.

 that whine is the sound of waste, rot, the frantic, grinding inability to attend to anything but sere thwarting of yourself, a dry corrosion which some say they know, but you and i—  (my jaw clenched as you turn a page, you with a heart like drywall, i who would lace my arms with razors, then press them slowly to your lips, the metal taste mixing with flesh, and through gritted teeth i making the sound of you, you, you do not know, meaning only me, me)  we know best.

 to the north, along orange blossom trail, thick breath of sludge fires. smoke rises all night, a spilled genie who loves the freezing trees but cannot save them. snow fine as blown spiders. the news: nothing. large rats breed on the beach driving smaller ones here. today both traps sit sprung.

 in her hand the knife, brisk, brilliant as moon-claw, shaves the flesh. it grazes the white belly just over the heart. underneath, the coiled fingers are cradling a soft flesh as if it were the jowls of the aged  man propped for a while on the bench in the park. the head is not severed, the eyes not out. blue, they appear to flash odd ways where a tree makes a live shadow. mostly the eyes are dead. nothing is in them  except the intense blue of sky the tree allows. there is no conspiring of nerves, no least event recalled by a limb’s high arching, or even a girl’s ascension from a forgotten distance of water.  but there is something as she lifts the meat. it is enough to draw down her gaze. now her arm rises against yellow hair fallen white in a childish face. she is still as a leaf barely clinging.  i come to her like a cat in the stunned grass and touch her to see the startled, upthrusted gleam of her face. at brow and each cheek like gathered beads of mist scales leap with the sun, and are dead.  no word passes between us, but something electric as a flash of steel makes her cry out just once. squatting at the yard’s edge, she sings beyond any thought. her knife flies as lethal as love and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss.  
NEW POEM
 clear night, thumb-top of a moon, a back-lit sky. moon-fingers lay down their same routine on the side deck and the threshold, the white keys and the black keys. bird hush and bird song. a cassia flower falls.  i want to be bruised by god. i want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out. i want to be stretched, like music wrung from a dropped seed. i want to be entered and picked clean.  and the wind says “what?” to me. and the castor beans, with their little earrings of death, say “what?” to me. and the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark. and the gears notch and the engines wheel.  
NEW POEM
 he gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and i could stand amused all afternoon in the hon kee grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh i know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass. i step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick.  such a sorrowful chinese face, nomad, gobi, northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. he could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. in his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he’d mumble his favorite passages. he could be my grandfather; come to america to get a western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother.  he lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel.  the head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and i see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death? is this how i, too, recoil from my day? see how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. see its grease on the blade. is this how i’ll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? this is also how i looked before i tore my mother open. is this how i presided over my century, is this how i regarded the murders? this is also how i prayed. was it me in the other i prayed to when i prayed? this too was how i slept, clutching my wife. was it me in the other i loved when i loved another? the butcher sees me eye this delicacy. with a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. i take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. i eat my man.  the noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover’s heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. these are the faces i love, the bodies and scents of bodies for which i long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day’s end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands.  brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. in a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the t’ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. all are beautiful by variety. the soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. god is the text. the soul is a corruption and a mnemonic.  a bright moment, i hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. i take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me, and i feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. what is it in me would devour the world to utter it? what is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. i would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. i would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man’s hands, i would eat the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, i would eat it all to utter it. the deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, i would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these chinatown deaths, these american deaths. i would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world.  
NEW POEM
 for a month now, wandering over the sierras, a poem had been gathering in my mind, details of significance and rhythm, the way poems do, but still lacking a focus. last night i remembered the date and it all began to grow together and take on purpose. we sat up late while deneb moved over the zenith and i told marie all about boston, how it looked that last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping impotent in the streets that last midnight. i told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands, how america was forever a different place afterwards for many. in the morning we swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue damsel flies on all the reeds like millions of narrow metallic flowers, and i thought of you behind the grille in dedham, vanzetti, saying, “who would ever have thought we would make this history?” crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow illuminated with asters and cyclamen, the pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting with the shifting wind over it and the blue and sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind, i saw you in the sour prison light, saying, “goodbye comrade.” in the basin under the crest where the pines end and the sierra primrose begins, a party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle. the bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it. looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake, the pattern of human beings seemed simpler than the diagonals of water and stone. climbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock, i remembered what you said about sacco, how it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record. traversing below the ragged arête, one cheek pressed against the rock the wind slapping the other, i saw you both marching in an army you with the red and black flag, sacco with the rattlesnake banner. i kicked steps up the last snow bank and came to the indescribably blue and fragrant polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit. these are the things that will last a long time, vanzetti, i am glad that once on your day i have stood among them. some day mountains will be named after you and sacco. they will be here and your name with them, “when these days are but a dim remembering of the time when man was wolf to man.” i think men will be remembering you a long time standing on the mountains many men, a long time, comrade.  
NEW POEM
 a blue stain creeps across the deep pile of the evergreens. from inside the forest it seems like an interior matter, something wholly to do with trees, a color passed from one to another, a requirement to which they submit unflinchingly like soldiers or brave people getting older. then the sun comes back and it’s totally over.

NEW POEM
 the morning comes, and thickening clouds prevail, hanging like curtains all the horizon round, or overhead in heavy stillness sail; so still is day, it seems like night profound; scarce by the city’s din the air is stirred, and dull and deadened comes its every sound; the cock’s shrill, piercing voice subdued is heard, by the thick folds of muffling vapors drowned. dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear, their outlines lost and blended with the sky; and well-known objects, that to all are near, no longer seem familiar to the eye, but with fantastic forms they mock the sight, as when we grope amid the gloom of night.

 what is pink? a rose is pink by a fountain's brink. what is red? a poppy's red in its barley bed. what is blue? the sky is blue where the clouds float thro'. what is white? a swan is white sailing in the light. what is yellow? pears are yellow, rich and ripe and mellow. what is green? the grass is green, with small flowers between. what is violet? clouds are violet in the summer twilight. what is orange? why, an orange, just an orange!

 there is magic in decay. a dance to be done for the rotting, the maggot strewn piles of flesh which pile upon the dung-ridden earth and the damp that gathers and rusts and defiles. there is a bit of this in even the most zoetic soul — the dancing child’s arms flailing to an old ska song conduct the day-old flies away to whatever rank native is closest. just today i was walking along the river with my daughter in my backpack and i opened my email on my phone and duffie had sent me a poem called “compost.” i read it to my little girl and started to explain before i was three words in selma started yelling, daddy, daddy, snake! in the path was a snake, belly up and still nerve-twitching the ghost of some passing bicycle or horse. pretty, selma said. yes, i said. and underneath my yes another yes, the yes to my body, just beginning to show signs of slack, and another, my grasping in the dark for affirming flesh that in turn says yes, yes let’s rot together but not until we’ve drained what sap is left in these trees. and i wake in the morning and think of the coroner calling to ask what color my father’s eyes were, and i asked, why? why can’t you just look — and the coroner, matter-of-factly says, decay. do you want some eggs, my love? i have a new way of preparing them. and look, look outside, i think this weather has the chance of holding.

 aliens have inhabited my aesthetics for decades. really since the early 70s.  before that i pretty much wrote as myself, though young. but something  has happened to my memory, my judgment: apparently, my will has been  affected. that old stuff, the fork in my head, first home run,  dad falling out of the car— i remember the words, but i  can't get back there anymore. i think they must be screening my  sensations. i'm sure my categories have been messed with. i look at  the anthologies in the big chains and campus bookstores, even the small  press opium dens, all those stanzas against the white space—they just  look like the models in the catalogs. the models have arms and  legs and a head, the poems mostly don't, but other than that  it's hard—for me anyway—to tell them apart. there's the sexy  underwear poem, the sturdy workboot poem you could wear to a party  in a pinch, the little blaspheming dress poem. there's variety, you say:  the button-down oxford with offrhymed cuffs. the epic toga, showing some ancient  ankle, the behold! the world is changed and finally i'm normal flowing  robe and shorts, the full nude, the scatter—yes, i suppose there's  variety, but the looks, those come on and read me for the  inner you i've locked onto with my cultural capital sensing device looks!  no thanks, jay peterman! no thanks, "ordinary evening in new haven"! i'm  just waiting for my return ticket to have any meaning, for those  saucer-shaped clouds to lower! the authorities deny any visitations—hardly a surprise.  and i myself deny them—think about it. what could motivate a  group of egg-headed, tentacled, slimier-than-thou aestheticians with techniquies far beyond ours to  visit earth, abduct naive poets, and inculcate them with otherwordly forms that  are also, if you believe the tabloids, salacious? and these abductions always  seem to take place in some provincial setting: isn't that more than  slightly suspicious? why don't they ever reveal themselves hovering over some new  york publishing venue? it would be nice to get some answers here—  we might learn something, about poetry if nothing else, but i'm not  much help, since i'm an abductee, at least in theory, though, like  i say, i don't remember much. but this writing seems pretty normal:  complete sentences; semicolons; yada yada. i seem to have lost my avant-garde  card in the laundry. they say that's typical. well, you'll just have  to use your judgment, earthlings! judgment, that's your job! back to work!  as if you could leave! and you thought gravity was a problem!

 the snail pushes through a green night, for the grass is heavy with water and meets over the bright path he makes, where rain has darkened the earth’s dark. he moves in a wood of desire,  pale antlers barely stirring as he hunts. i cannot tell what power is at work, drenched there with purpose, knowing nothing. what is a snail’s fury? all i think is that if later  i parted the blades above the tunnel and saw the thin trail of broken white across litter, i would never have imagined the slow passion to that deliberate progress.

 since all that beat about in nature's range, or veer or vanish; why should'st thou remain the only constant in a world of change, o yearning thought! that liv'st but in the brain? call to the hours, that in the distance play, the faery people of the future day— fond thought! not one of all that shining swarm will breathe on thee with life-enkindling breath, till when, like strangers shelt'ring from a storm, hope and despair meet in the porch of death! yet still thou haunt'st me; and though well i see, she is not thou, and only thou are she, still, still as though some dear embodied good, some living love before my eyes there stood with answering look a ready ear to lend, i mourn to thee and say—'ah! loveliest friend! that this the meed of all my toils might be, to have a home, an english home, and thee!' vain repetition! home and thou are one. the peacefull'st cot, the moon shall shine upon, lulled by the thrush and wakened by the lark, without thee were but a becalméd bark, whose helmsman on an ocean waste and wide sits mute and pale his mouldering helm beside.  and art thou nothing? such thou art, as when the woodman winding westward up the glen at wintry dawn, where o'er the sheep-track's maze the viewless snow-mist weaves a glist'ning haze, sees full before him, gliding without tread, an image with a glory round its head; the enamoured rustic worships its fair hues, nor knows he makes the shadow, he pursues!

 the jungle, from the floor to the canopy, clogs and entwines its every rung and level with rank growth. the python dines among an epiphytic gaudery and hungry vines. on the mizzled hair of the two-toed sloth moss has designs. yet all that climbing tonnage is content-free. the top limbs sway as though to write in air, but can’t remember what they scribble there. through the savanna’s heat-glaze the herds pause, ripple and shiver, or graze hypnotically, or drop their young, which may deliver their wet thin steps into the lion’s jaws. by pool or river they stoop at evening side by side among the surface quiver of their reflexions as the light withdraws: a fable set down in invisible ink; they print their shadows on the pool they drink. even the perfect pictures in the shale’s slow-motion traps, the filamentous feathers, which one or two sharp hammer taps release, the fish in their meticulous scales, the precise maps of leaves, did not direct this rendezvous. they’re simply gaps in time, and have no part in these details. the weird wiwaxias, worms and arthropods were empty of intention as stone gods. once, though, a figure had the thought to crawl out of the day into a cave’s dark reach, its first invoker, and there to splay his hand against the tallow-glimmered wall, and pause to spray his mouth’s cargo of spittle and red ochre on the array of his five fingers, clear, indelible: author and content of the space displayed, the maker’s hand becoming what it made.

 in the blackest recesses of bistro malatesta entre les heures du quatre à cinq (forgoing his liaison with odette for the third time in as many days) prudhomme observes a snailfish  undulating round the hat stand’s spine, the stalagmites of candles (its sad, small eyes, its cryptic lack of scales)  wants to cleave to it  wants to shake the dipsomaniac in the corner, hiss ay caramba! have you seen it? here on the rue mouffetard — so far from deep-sea canyons, so far from home?  considers eating it flavored with rosemary, flavored with dill  whiskery thing  sees it, loses it in gauloise furls, catches it again, its curl/uncurl progression along a velveteen banquette  it stirs him — its decision in oblivion to be a thing of  light and so gelatinous  thinks of turtles nibbled at by surgeonfish  wonders if perhaps he’s lost his grip, and if  he has, likes it  
NEW POEM
 a heave of afternoon light pulls a tulip from the turf, a bower for locusts, a cup of shells. the farmhouse tilts, a bent shadow on wheels. in cedar rooms a family is molded, silent, wrapped in the wire of steel eyes and stopped voice, romantic ash. this is not my house, my ghost, my uninvited guest, my lost labor of love, my thicket or grease, my jpeg gessoed or rawhide suit. the yellow light throbs like an internal organ — soft body of an overture to insect sounds — sapling of a new world — whose future awaits me at the tilting window of my own domestic hut. perhaps this is my mesh of hours, my muscular ache, my guardian sash, twist of rope carved around an old maple trunk, my rod of power red with anticipatory friction at the edge of an emerging set of planetary rings. stained ochre by the air i pitch forward, a vanilla-scented pear that floats or falls. in the rattan chair on the front porch by the blistered boards of the front door a figure of tar watches. cool dust sparkles and settles. shadows have made me visible. an empty wagon flares on the hillside.  
NEW POEM
 1.   consider the tragic fortitude of mannikins, the courage it takes under casual poses to do nothing interminably each day.  to face unflinching (through sunlit glass that bars them from it) the rushing surf of life within reach where they must stand marooned on their islands’ plastic turf,  and not to cry out: more heroic than those romans the lava rain stunned to statues—misshaped by the panic that twisted their limbs, glazed with their pain  in black rock—friezes of agony. you would never know, from the relaxed swivel of this woman’s wrist as she completes a backhand with her racket,  that she will never take another swing, or from her smile that she has stood balanced here on one foot all summer like one of dante’s damned, and not cracked.   2.   ‘cracked’ is my father’s word for ‘crazy,’ as in ‘you’d have to be cracked to pay that much for a pair of shoes.’ he’s not crazy, but he forgets, and today  as we pay out his visit’s hours strolling on bloor, he thinks up the same questions again minutes after he’s nodded and smiled at answers to them.  looking for things to look at and not think, i focus on another grove of mummers: headless, their necks poke out like worms from the smartly turned-over  collars of turtlenecks and jackets. you can tell they’ve also lost their arms from the way the sleeves plummet slackly off their shoulders—although they, ashamed  to show the mutilation, act cool and tuck the cuffs into their pockets. i look at my father—hands trembling, head crazed like china with minute cracks  through which years exit invisibly— and must remind myself his show is kinder, the long-running comedy where he’s played every part, from fresh-faced  mooning lover to child-duped parent to doddering senex: still free now (while heart and limbs play their duet) to do a walk-on, ad lib, bow out.  he sweats a little in the sunshine. summer stock, lacking the tragic poise that freezes these actors in their scene, we move on towards a shadier place.  
NEW POEM
 immense, entirely itself, it wore that yard like a dress,  with limbs low enough for me to enter it and climb the crooked ladder to where  i could lean against the trunk and practice being alone.  one day, i heard the sound before i saw it, rain fell darkening the sidewalk.  sitting close to the center, not very high in the branches, i heard it hitting the high leaves, and i was happy,  watching it happen without it happening to me.  
NEW POEM
 shepherdboy?   not the most salient image for contemporary readers nor most available.   unless you’re thinking brokeback mountain : a reference already escaping.   i did love a montana man, though no good shepherd  rather: a caveman, came spelunking into that grotto i’d retreated to  what light he bore illumined such small space—physically, temporally  and did he have a grove of beech trees? no, no grove but together we found an old-growth stand of   redwood  we gouged each other’s chests instead of wood:   pledges that faded he was not cruel nor i unwitting.   but what endures beyond any thicket?   example: he took me to the ocean to say farewell.   i mean me: farewell to ocean the ocean, for that matter, to me.   us both fatigued, showing signs of wreckage  and that man i had loved stood back from the edge of things  he did not hold me  i expected not to be held  we all understood one another: shepherd understudy, ocean, me   and did he go back to his fields and caves? yes, but they were gone strip-mining, lumber, defoliant, sterile streams: you knew that was coming  weren’t we taught some starched sermon: the pasture awaits us elsewhere   back up a moment: the forest you mentioned—remember, instead of a grove?  untouched for the most part.   some human damage, but not ours  we left no mark, not there in the midst of those great trees: not in the concentric rings that might have held us far past living  instead, i put that man, like so many others, on paper— a tree already gone from sight where once it had drawn the eyes upward: the crest of a mountain.   crumpled thoughts, crumpled love   shepherdboy, do you see the wild fennel bulbs i gathered for you olallieberries, new-mown grass, the tender fruits of   the coastal fig?  i put them on paper, too, so fragile.   for nothing is ever going to last   for haines eason  
NEW POEM
 a yarn ball and a hill maintain an equipoise until their neatness starts to bore the gods of potential and energy who hedge bets, reckoning the odds of when the rest will be  set in motion, and who, first stumbling upon this clew, constructed both the incline and the inclination to unwind. like most gods, though, they haven’t planned to stay; they mastermind  the scheme,ex nihilio, then slip behind the shadow show and designate an agent, chief remaker of their mischief made. each time, disguised, this leitmotif gets salvaged and replayed,  a universe begins, for orogens and origins suppose a way things were before some volatile, untimely that— sweetness perverted by the core or belfry by the bat,  or here, a hilly green, whose still life, eerily serene, completes their best contrivance yet: from high above, a williwaw, a hiss, and then the silhouette of one terrific paw.  
NEW POEM
 oh, unreadable one, why have you done this to your dumb creature? why have you chosen to punish the coyote  rummaging for chicken bones in the dung heap, shucked the fur from his tail and fashioned it into a scabby cane?  why have you denuded his face, tufted it, so that when he turns he looks like a slow child unhinging his face in a smile?  the coyote shambles, crow-hops, keeps his head low, and without fur, his now visible pizzle is a sad red protuberance,  his hind legs the backward image of a bandy-legged grandfather, stripped. why have you unhoused this wretch  from his one aesthetic virtue, taken from him that which kept him from burning in the sun like a man?  why have you pushed him from his world into mine, stopped him there and turned his ear toward my warning shout?

 i suppose i shan’t go fishing pa, for fear of finding we’re no fishers, our folk, for all our bent for fish scraps and our tolerance for muck dwellers and the like.  this creek is like no other, pa, inky cold and familiar, don’t drink from it, it commands, don’t kneel, don’t stare down  or wash in it, don't pry your shoes from off your battered stubs, not yet, no jay flashes past and asks how you mean to ask a shit creek to provide.  you exist. it would, too. it falls through these viney half-corrupted patches of nettled hickory and oak into a muddy slough into a culvert, splitting  around the treatment plant then joining itself back in a ramrod concrete channel beneath pavement; then into the lake, sludge, great lake.  do you follow? it’s taking you somewhere, it matters not where, pa, it’s a trip at your command, inaudible.  it’s the postponed one we would have scheduled in these winding down days together had we not been what we made of us. in the stagnant north woods. in the pale thick end-of-knowing daylight.  
NEW POEM
 the twilight is the morning of his day. while sleep drops seaward from the fading shore, with purpling sail and dip of silver oar, he cheers the shadowed time with roundelay, until the dark east softens into gray. now as the noisy hours are coming—hark! his song dies gently—it is growing dark— his night, with its one star, is on the way!  faintly the light breaks over the blowing oats— sleep, little brother, sleep: i am astir. we worship song, and servants are of her— i in the bright hours, thou in shadow-time: lead thou the starlit night with merry notes, and i will lead the clamoring day with rhyme.  
NEW POEM
 the snail at the edge of the road inches forward, a trim gray finger of a fellow in pinstripe suit. he’s burdened by his house that has to follow where he goes.  every inch, he pulls together all he is, all he owns, all he was given.  the road is wide but he is called by something that knows him on the other side.  
NEW POEM
 that night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes, but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction. “that’s silly. how can there be a wrong direction? ‘it bloweth where it listeth,’ as you know, just as we do when we make love or do something else there are no rules for.”  i tell you, something went wrong there a while back. just don’t ask me what it was. pretend i’ve dropped the subject. no, now you’ve got me interested, i want to know exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could  seem wrong to you. in what way do things get to be wrong? i’m sitting here dialing my cellphone with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel with the other. and then something like braids will stand out,  on horsehair cushions. that armchair is really too lugubrious. we’ve got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house, talk our relationship back to its beginnings. say, you know that’s probably what’s wrong—the beginnings concept, i mean. i aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some sometime. we’d stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater  had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. the lobby cards drew us in. it was afternoon, we found ourselves sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly crowded. that was the day we first realized we didn’t fully know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly amid the gray snow falling. twilight had already set in.

 either the postagestamp-bright inflorescence of wild mustard or the drab tassel of prairie smoke, waving its dirty garments  either the low breeze through the cracked window or houseflies and drawn blinds to spare us the calid sun  one day commands the next to lie down, to scatter:      we're done with allegiance, devotion, the malicious idea of what's eternal  picture the terrain sunk, return of the inland sea, your spectacle your metaphor, the scope of this twiggy dominion pulled under  crest and crest, wave and cloud, the thunder blast and burst of swells this is the sum of us:      brief sneezeweed, brief yellow blaze put out  so little, your departure, one plunk upon the earth's surface, one drop to bind the dust, a little mud, a field of mud  the swale gradually submerged, gradually forgotten and that is all that is to be borne of your empirical trope:  first, a congregated light, the brilliance of a meadowland in bloom and then the image must fail, as we must fail, as we  graceless creatures that we are, unmake and befoul our beds don't tell me deluge.      don't tell me heat, too damned much heat  
NEW POEM
 they think she lives alone on the edge of town in a two-room house where she moved when her husband died at thirty-five of a gunshot wound in the bed of another woman. the curandera and house have aged together to the rhythm of the desert.  she wakes early, lights candles before her sacred statues, brews tea of yerbabuena. she moves down her porch steps, rubs cool morning sand into her hands, into her arms. like a large black bird, she feeds on the desert, gathering herbs for her basket.  her days are slow, days of grinding dried snake into powder, of crushing wild bees to mix with white wine. and the townspeople come, hoping to be touched by her ointments, her hands, her prayers, her eyes. she listens to their stories, and she listens to the desert, always, to the desert.  by sunset she is tired. the wind strokes the strands of long gray hair, the smell of drying plants drifts into her blood, the sun seeps into her bones. she dozes on her back porch. rocking, rocking.

 just over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing. we can hear it always. earthquake, starvation, the ever-renewing sump of corpse-flesh. but in this valley the snow falls silently all day, and out our window we see the curtain of it shifting and folding, hiding us away in our little house, we see earth smoothened and beautified, made like a fantasy, the snow-clad trees so graceful. in our new bed, which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost with our two cats, cooker and smudgins, lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners, we lie loving and warm, looking out from time to time. “snowbound,” we say. we speak of the poet who lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province, the kingdom of cruelty, where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months across the pass and drifted deep in the vale. in our kitchen the maple-fire murmurs in our stove. we eat cheese and new-made bread and jumbo spanish olives which have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeños and garlic and dill and thyme. we have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh. for a while we close the immense index of images that is our lives—for instance, the child on the mescalero reservation in new mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family’s hut, covered with sores, unable to speak. but of course we see the child every day, we hold out our hands, we touch him shyly, we make offerings to his implacability. no, the index cannot close. and how shall we survive? we don’t and cannot and will never know. beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable. the machine, like an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house, as big as the whole town, may break through and lurch into our valley at any moment, at any moment. cheers, baby. here’s to us. see how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back.  
NEW POEM
 the damselfly folds its wings over its body when at rest. captured, it should not be killed in cyanide, but allowed to die slowly: then the colors, especially the reds and blues, will last. in the hand it crushes easily into a rosy slime. its powers of flight are weak. the trout  feeds on the living damselfly. the trout leaps up from the water, and if there is sun you see the briefest shiver of gold, and then the river again. when the trout dies it turns its white belly to the mirror of the sky. the heron fishes for the trout  in the gravelly shallows on the far side of the stream. the heron is the exact blue of the shadows the sun makes of trees on water. when you hold the heron most clearly in your eye, you are least certain it is there. when the blue heron dies, it lies beyond reach on the far side of the river.

 the sun that puts its spokes in every wheel of manhandle and tree  derives its path of seashines (sheer centrifugality) from my  regards. i send it my regards. some yards  of lumen from the fabrika have come unbolted from the look  of it (or likes of me), a long unweaving or recarding i  cannot recall begun, and there before my eyes a palm  puts lashes round the sun.

 1  a tattering of rain and then the reign of pour and pouring-down and down, where in the westward gathered the filming gown of grey and clouding weakness, and, in the mane of the light’s glory and the day’s splendor, gold and vain, vivid, more and more vivid, scarlet, lucid and more luminous, then came a splatter, a prattle, a blowing rain! and soon the hour was musical and rumorous: a softness of a dripping lipped the isolated houses, a gaunt grey somber softness licked the glass of hours.   2  again, after a catbird squeaked in the special silence, and clouding vagueness fogged the windowpane and gathered blackness and overcast, the mane of light’s story and light’s glory surrendered and ended —a pebble—a ring—a ringing on the pane, a blowing and a blowing in: tides of the blue and cold moods of the great blue bay, and slates of grey came down upon the land’s great sea, the body of this day —hardly an atom of silence amid the roar allowed the voice to form appeal—to call: by kindled light we thought we saw the bronze of fall.  
NEW POEM
 i leant upon a coppice gate when frost was spectre-grey, and winter's dregs made desolate the weakening eye of day. the tangled bine-stems scored the sky like strings of broken lyres, and all mankind that haunted nigh had sought their household fires.  the land's sharp features seemed to be the century's corpse outleant, his crypt the cloudy canopy, the wind his death-lament. the ancient pulse of germ and birth was shrunken hard and dry, and every spirit upon earth seemed fervourless as i.  at once a voice arose among the bleak twigs overhead in a full-hearted evensong of joy illimited; an aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small, in blast-beruffled plume, had chosen thus to fling his soul upon the growing gloom.  so little cause for carolings of such ecstatic sound was written on terrestrial things afar or nigh around, that i could think there trembled through his happy good-night air some blessed hope, whereof he knew and i was unaware.

 i am as guilty as many. no one speaks of david ignatow anymore. no one speaks of  your lonesome time in the new york boonies, those outer reaches of jamaica, where the z &amp; j lines go no more. no one speaks of your sparsely furnished rooms, the low-slung danish sofa where you sit and muse and daydream out the grimed window on rainy days. even in the warmth of spring, there is no spring. you don’t go out much, i would imagine. i imagine much for the both of us. all those darknesses at noon. those woodlands filled with songbirds twittering. even scribblings on the morning times are but a momentary respite. words we’ve been blessed with, still blessed, even in our nightly dreams unfinished. where art thou now, dear david? where is the love for my desperation that i may fight your fears?

 you can see the face of everything, and it is white— plaster, nightmare, adobe, anemia, cold— turned to the east. oh closeness to life! hardness of life! like something in the body that is animal—root, slag-ends— with the soul still not set well there— and mineral and vegetable! sun standing stiffly against man, against the sow, the cabbages, the mud wall! —false joy, because you are merely in time, as they say, and not in the soul!  the entire sky taken up by moist and steaming heaps, a horizon of dung piles. sour remains, here and there, of the night. slices of the green moon, half-eaten, crystal bits from false stars, plaster, the paper ripped off, still faintly sky-blue. the birds not really awake yet, in the raw moon, streetlight nearly out. mob of beings and things! —a true sadness, because you are really deep in the soul, as they say, not in time at all!

 whether the harborline or the east shoreline consummated it was nobody’s biz until you got there, eyelids ashimmer, content with one more dispensation from blue above. and just like we were saying, the people began to show some interest in the mud-choked harbor. it could be summer again for all anyone in our class knew. yeah, that’s right. bumped from our dog-perch, we’d had to roil with the last of them.  it’s taken a while since i’ve been here, but i’m resolved. what, didn’t i print, little piles of notes, slopes almost sicilian? here is my friend: socks for comfort (now boys) will see later. did they come? the inner grocery had to take three sets of clips away. speaking to him of intricate family affairs. i’m not what you think. stay preconscious. it’s just the “flooding of the council.” no need to feel afraid.  
NEW POEM
 what was the future then but affirmation, the first yes between us followed by the first lingering dawn? waking below a window shaded by redwoods (waking? we hadn’t slept—), we found time saved, like sunlight in a tree.  still, the house was cold, and there were shadows. the couple in the next room rapped the wall to quiet us, like them, condescending from a bitter knowledge that, young as we all were, love didn’t last, but receded into silence.  wedging our pillows back of the headboard that clapped in time with us, we let them think we agreed. then, holding on, we closed each other’s mouths and felt that slowness that the best days begin with turn into the speed with which they fly.  flight was that year’s theme, all around us— flight of hunter and hunted, the president turning inward on one wing, and, on the patio, the emigration of termites, a glittering fleet, leaving that shadowed house a little lighter.  within it all, above it, or beyond, we thought we were the fixed point, and held still as the quail lit down beside us and waited for her plump mate to appear, his crest a quivering hook. the valley’s reach of sunshine reeled them in.  there was wilderness around us, don’t forget. behind the nets of fragrance thrown across our path by the acacia lurked the green man or the kidnapper. and there was the pacific with its own passions taking place as rain.  the sorrow of the couple in the next room was a deep muteness nightly. that loneliness could come of loving was like news of time cored out of the redwood. the house that we made shake, or thought we did, was taking wing already.  after we left, still it took us years before we stopped comparing every morning together to that first one and every place we lived to that first place and everything we said to that first word repeated all night long.  
NEW POEM
 i’ve been thinking about the anatomy of the egg, about the two interior membranes,  the yolk held in place by the chalazae, gases moving through the semipermeable shell.  a curious phrase,the anatomy of the egg, as if an egg were a body, which it is,  as if the egg could be broken then mended, which, depending on your faith, broken yes,  but mended? well. best to start again, with a new body, voided  from a warmer one, brooded and turned. better to begin as if some small-handed  animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock, licked clean the rich yolk and left  the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole.  what i wanted: a practice that reassured that what was cracked could be mended  or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread. but now i wonder: better to be the egg or scaled  mandible? the small hand or the flies, bottle black and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left,  sweeping the interior, drinking it clean? i think,something might have grown there, though  i know it was always meant to be eaten, it was always meant to spoil.

 offer your usual posy of goatheads. proffer sharp garlands of thistle &amp; incas’ thin down; of squash bugs strung on blighted stems; send  back necklaced every reeking pearl i crushed,  each egg cluster that i scraped away with knife or twig or thumbnail. wake me sweat-laced from a dream of hidden stables: the gentle foals  atremble, stem-legged, long-neglected. dear drought our summer’s corn was overrun again with weed &amp; cheat; the bitter zinnias fell to bits.  dear yearlings our harvest is lattice &amp; husk.  
NEW POEM
 when the beautiful young man drowned— accidentally, swimming at dawn in a current too swift for him, or obedient to some cult of total immersion that promised the bather would come up divine,  mortality rinsed from him— hadrian placed his image everywhere, a marble antinoüs staring across the public squares where a few dogs always scuffled, planted in every squalid little crossroads  at the furthest corners of the empire. what do we want in any body but the world? and if the lover’s inimitable form was nowhere, then he would find it everywhere, though the boy became simply more dead  as the sculptors embodied him. wherever hadrian might travel, the beloved figure would be there first: the turn of his shoulders, the exact marble nipples, the drowned face not really lost  to the nile—which has no appetite, merely takes in anything without judgment or expectation— but lost into its own multiplication, an artifice rubbed with oils and acid so that the skin might shine.  which of these did i love? here is his hair, here his hair again. here the chiseled liquid waist i hold because i cannot hold it. if only one of you  
NEW POEM
 baton rouge, 1940 these are savannas bluer than your dreams where other loves are fashioned to older music, and the romantic in his light boat puts out among flamingos and water moccasins looking for the river that went by last year.  even the angels wear confederate uniforms; and when the magnolia blooms and the honeysuckle, golden lovers, brighter than the moon, read catullus in the flaring light of the burning negro in the open eye of midnight.  and the traveller, moving in the hot swamps, where every human sympathy sends up the temperature, comes of a sudden on the hidden glacier, whose motives are blonder than hitler’s choir boys.  here is the ambiguous tenderness of ’gators trumpeting their loves along a hundred miles of rivers writhing under trees like myths— and human existence pursues the last, the simple and desperate life of the senses. since love survives only as ironic legend— response to situations no longer present— men lacking dignity are seized by pride, which is the easy upper-class infection.  the masters are at home in this merciless climate but deep in the caves of their minds some animal memory warns of the fate of the mammoth at the end of the ice-age; as sleeping children a toy, they hug the last, fatal error, but their eyes are awake and their dreams shake as with palsy.  over birmingham where the blast furnace flowers and beyond the piney woods in cotton country, continually puzzling the pale aristocrats, the sun burns equally white man and black.  the labor which they do makes more and more their brotherhood condition for their whole existence; they mint their own light, and their fusing fires will melt at last these centuries of ice.  this is a nightmare nimble in the big house, where sleepers are wakeful, cuddling their terror, in the empty acres of their rich beds, dreaming of bones in museums, where the black boys yawn.

 1  i keep placing my hands over my face, the fingertips just resting on the place where i feel my eyebrows and the fine end of a bone. my eyes are covered with the blood of my hands, my palms hold my jaws. i do this at dinner. my daughter asks are you all right? and by a common miracle when i smile she knows i am.  2  i ask her what she will do after we eat. sleep she tells me. but i will clean the deer skull, wash it.  3  you gave me this skull in the woods told me to bring it clean and tell the story i had told you before, about how the deer had come to me, and i said i would.  4  and i put this skull on an old newspaper, pulled the lower part of the jaws free, touched it first carefully, as if it would fall apart in my hands, the bone paper- thin, and then i saw i could scrub, so brushed the surface with steel and my fingers and more and more this surface became familiar to me.  5  i wanted to see the lines of it what it would be if it had been polished by the wind, the water, and my hands, these agents making the skull more itself. slowly i was not afraid at all and my fingers went into the deepest holes of this thing, not afraid for myself or it, feeling suddenly as if cleaning this small fragment of earth away from the crevices inside was like loving.  6  but it was when i touched the place where the eyes were that i knew this was the shell of the deer that had lived here, this was this deer and not this deer, her home and now empty of her, but not empty of her, i knew also, not empty of her, as my hands trembled.  7  and in that instant remembered you had been in that body of that deer dying, what does it feel like to be a deer dying, the death consumes you like birth, you are nowhere else but in the center.  8  remembering those gentle deer that watched me as i wept, or the deer that leapt as if out of my mind, when i saw speaking there in that green place the authority of the heart and the deer of the woods where my feet stood, stared at me until i whispered to her and cried at her presence.  9  and when i cleaned the skull i washed myself and sat my body half out of the water and put my hands again over my face, my fingers edging the bone over my eyes, and i thought how good this feels and this is a gesture you make.  10  tell this story of the deer’s skull you asked quietly and so i came in my own time to put these words carefully here slowly listing each motion on this thin paper as fragile and as tough as knowledge.  1978

 when with the skin you do acknowledge drought, the dry in the voice, the lightness of feet, the fine flake of the heat at every level line;  when with the hand you learn to touch without surprise the spine for the leaf, the prickled petal, the stone scorched in the shine, and the wood brittle;  then where the pipe drips and the fronds sprout and the foot-square forest of clover blooms in sand, you will lean and watch, but never touch with your hand.   september 1934

 kingston, jamaica lamps have begun to light as evening, alluvial, fills every crevice in the courtyard,  fills devon house, alone with its marble columns, its verandas and esplanades empty,  the plantation gone, and the fields, the courtyard a tourist attraction now:  glass ashtrays etched with boys too large to be clambering coconut trees,  statuettes of women too smooth to be burdened with baskets of fruit on their heads, stoneware  with doctor birds captured in the shallowest bas-relief, key rings carved in the rough shape of the island;  and now even the hummingbirds are spoken of as jewels where once everyone drowned in leaf-filtered sunlight.

 for ben fenton-smith none are more familiar with dew than professional footballers. from early grades they are used to running through practice drills and hurling their burly frames through rucks while the moist chaff of wet grass under the winter lights softens their fall, accustoms the half- back to the slippery ball and writes green cuneiform on wet sandshoes. and they fear it in the morning, kicking off the dew in the ‘twos’ because they ignored a coach’s warning. half their lives are spent in clouds of condensation or the cold heat of a winter sun where even the crowds seem like droplets on the concrete rose of the stadium. in the final days of their season , sweat-spangled on the eve of their triumph, the ball on a string and their plays honed, even the doubters believe. and the last day is, once again, already an aftermath: the ground’s been shaved and sucked dry by the noon sun and the paddock has become a paved and bristled hell for those who will collide with it and pinion flesh on earth, earth on flesh and spill blood for the sake of the game. possession is the law; all are possessed. and when the crowd melts into the dry darkness, after that great red football’s booted between the uprights of the sky- scrapers and gone, the sky bawls cheerless little drops for the victors and decks the oval with the losers’ jewels.

 felicity the healer isn’t young and you don’t look him up unless you need him. clown’s eyes, pope’s nose, a mouth for dirty stories, he made his bundle in the great depression  and now, a jovial immigrant success in baggy pinstripes, he winks and wheezes gossip, village stories that could lift your hair or lance a boil; the small town dirt, the dope,  the fishy deals and incestuous combinations, the husband and the wife of his wife’s brother, the hospital contract, the certificate ... a realist and hardy omnivore,  he strolls the jetties when the month is right with a knife and lemons in his pocket, after live mussels from among the smelly rocks, preventative of impotence and goitre.  and as though the sight of tissue healing crooked pleased him, like the ocean’s vaginal taste, he’ll stitch your thumb up so it shows for life. and where he once was the only quack in town  we all have heard his half-lame joke, the one about the operation that succeeded, the tangy line that keeps that clever eye so merry in the punchinello face.

 i used to be a dog. what kind? oh, a mongrel. nothing poncy like the black cocker spaniel called bonzo i had as a child. and certainly not one of those four-footed, aloof snakes that go by the name of greyhound. i remember each and every one of the lice that lived on me. where did i live? in sicily, where the sun shines like a fried egg every day of the year. i had the nose of an angel — i could smell porcini fifty trees away. i knew the man who would start a fight with my master the moment he walked in the bar door. i drank a saucer of red wine every day. i loved eating the butterflies that floated past me — one pounce and they were gone. and they were delicious. better than the bones of a donkey whose meat provided salami for my master and his family. the boy was very good to me — he used to take me down to the sea and let me splash in the waves; then i’d come out onto the sand, barking, and i’d shake all the seawater onto him, wetting his clothes. he loved laughing, and i loved barking. those were the days. i never saw a kennel. my home was an old blanket under a gnarled vine that had been there since dante wrote his only sestina, in homage to the troubadours. the heat was often scorching. the boy found it funny to put a straw hat on my head, one dyed in the colors of the italian flag. i was up early, out scouting for rats to frighten away.  i once peed on a hedgehog to see what it would do. i ran along the clifftop, barking at the wheeling seagulls, and at the fishing boats they flew above. i sometimes ate my master’s leftover spaghetti bolognese in the taverna. my tail would wag like a fan revolving from the ceiling. i was taught party tricks that i’d be asked to do when the grappa was being downed. i’d lie down on the floor and die, to great applause. i’d sit up and beg, to coos and laughter, and i’d be rewarded with a sausage, and those were sausages to swim the adriatic for. i’d sometimes go down to the harbor to look for an attractive gray bitch i liked the smell of. i’d have to fight off other dogs, but i was good at that. i ate one of their ears. once i followed her onto a boat that was heading out to fill up with fish. i had to swim back and i lay on the sand and slept. when i got home my master whipped me. i ran to my blanket, whimpering. i was once brought to a circus, and into the tent of a one-eyed woman with black hair who had a pet parrot. i barked at it, and the parrot expertly returned my bark. i lay on the multi-colored mat and observed the strange bird who observed me. i was glad to leave that tent. i enjoyed hearing the boy play his flute in the evenings. i heard those notes flutter up into the air, and i tried to see them, but never could. i never stopped trying, though. the one thing i couldn’t eat was cheese. the few times i tried it i vomited. on the first occasion that happened i tried to eat it again. if i got the chance now i’d manage it, i’m sure. who would not like to be a dog in the sun? a dog in the sun, like i used to be, long ago. it was an honor.

 you’ve got to understand that sighting the pair of eagles over the block, right over our house, not more than twenty feet above the roof, so massive their wings pull at the corrugated tin sheeting even with gentlest tilt, counteracts bitterness against all the damage i see and hear around me on an exclusively crisp blue morning, when clarity is pain and even one small missing wattle tree, entirely vanquished since i was last here at home—i still find this hard to say—is agony; a region is not a pinpoint and a different compass works in my head, having magnetics for all directions and all pointing to one spot i know and observe as closely as possible; and even one small vanished or vanquished wattle tree is agony close to death for me, where i find it hard to breathe to feed myself to get past the loss; but the pair of eagles still appearing and keeping their sharp and scrupulous eyes honed, overrides this ordeal, though i wish their victims life too and their damage is traumatic as anything else; that’s as much sense or nonsense as i can make in such blue light.

 i remember the dusty floorboards of wood in the streetcar of the minneapolis street railway company and the varnished yellow banquettes of tight-knit rattan worn smooth by decades of passengers the worn gleaming brass grips at the corners of the seats and the motorman’s little bell windows trembling in their casings as we crossed the avenue liberty dimes falling softly into the steel-rimmed hour glass the gnarled hand of the motorman near. my grandmother arranged herself against the seat her back as straight as a soldier’s beside me her navy hat with velvet band and net veil down making her head seem distant, her dreaming smile and the patient roman nose, a repose so deep; from my place i watched her when we rode like princes rattling past traffic stopped on the granite cobbles riding downtown together, my hands in hers; all that so much that i love yet but feel no sadness for, that time crossed out like the trolley tracks taken up or entombed under the pliant blacktop of the modernized.

 is this the river east i heard?— where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred and the reaching wharves from the inner land ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand—  and the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed from the rays of the morning sun which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.  but look at the depth of the drippling tide the dripples, reripples like the locusts astride; as the boat turns upon the silvery spread it leaves—strange—a shadow dead.  and the very charms from the reflective river and from the stacks of the floating boat— there seemeth the quality ne’er to dissever like the ruffles from the mystified smoke.

 dark by five, the day gives up and so do i, stalled at the top of the stairs i forget what for, adrift in a scrap of dream that’s not a dream exactly but a stupor, unrefined. i go astray in old routines, i dare myself to reconstruct the rules of old invented games—that one of throwing snowballs at the roof, to watch them shrink as they rolled down, spinning to their pits, to see the force that made them briefly a thing so neatly undone. today an old friend’s tiny boy lobbied me to pitch some snowballs at him. i bowed to his dense little will. but planned to miss. as i packed and flung each one to its unpacking, he hunted down the humble bits and crumbs of every impact, as they ran from him along the icy slope, and gathered and carried them back to me at the top. eating them as he came. so that’s how you get to the marrow of breakdown. i forgot. that you could put what’s left to your lips.

 there is a spectacle and something is added to history. it has as its object an indiscretion: old age, a gun, the prevention of sleep.  i am placed in its stead and the requisite shadow is yours. it casts across me, a violent coat.  it seems i fit into its sleeve. so the body wanders. sometime it goes where light does not reach.  you recall how they moved in the moon dust?hop, hop. what they said to us from that distance was stupid. they did not say i love you for example.  the spectacle has been placed in my room. can you hear its episode trailing, pretending to be a thing with variegated wings?  do you know the name of this thing? it is a rubbing from an image. the subject of the image is that which trespasses.  you are invited to watch. the body in complete dark casting nothing back. the thing turns and flicks and opens.

 no daylight for two months, an ice chisel slivers  frozen lake water refracting blue cinders.   by light of an oil lamp, a child learns to savor marrow:  cracked caribou bones a heap on the floor.   a sinew, thickly wrapped in soot, threads through  the meat on her chin: a tattoo in three slender lines.   one white ptarmigan plume fastened to the lip of  a birch wood basket; thaw approaches: the plume turns brown.   on the edge of the open lead, a toggle-head harpoon  waits to launch: bowhead sings to krill.   thickened pack ice cracking; a baleen fishing line  pulls taut a silver dorsal fin of a round white fish.   a slate-blade knife slices along the grain of a caribou  hindquarter; the ice cellar lined in willow branches is empty.   saltwater suffuses into a flint quarry, offshore  a thin layer of radiation glazes leathered walrus skin.   alongside shatters of a hummock, a marsh marigold  flattens under three black toes of a sandhill crane.   a translucent sheep horn dipper skims a freshwater stream;  underneath, arctic char lay eggs of mercury.   picked before the fall migration, cloudberries  drench in whale oil, ferment in a sealskin poke.   a tundra swan nests inside a rusted steel rum;  she abandons her newborns hatched a deep crimson.

 ... mindful of the unhonored dead —thomas gray here they stood, whom the kecoughtan first believed gods from another world, one pair of longjohns each, bad-yellow, knotted with lice, the godless, bandy-legged runts with ear bit off, or eye gouged, who killed and prayed over whatever flew, squatted, or swam.  in huts hacked from mulberry, pine, and swamp cyprus, they huddled ripe as hounds. at cockcrow scratched, shuffled marsh paths, took skiffs and ferried to dead-rise scows, twenty-footers dutifully designed and of right draft for oysters, crabs, and croakers. they were seaworthy.  according to diaries hand-scrawled, and terse court records, our ancestors: barbarous, habitual, virginians.  some would not sail, came ashore, walked on the land, kept faces clenched, lay seed and family, moved often, and are gone. of them this harbor says nothing. of the sea’s workmen, not much, no brass plate of honor, no monument in the square, no square, merely the wreckage of a place.  but they stood— proud, black and white, surly in mist at the hovel of the boatwright, arm pointed: build me one like that yonder! meaning the gray hull i see across a cove, bottom up, canting, nameless now as the hard, long arm, daddy’s or granddaddy’s, that points, but known to the one said to crush clams in his palms, thus got paid, always, who built the derelicts, and who, barring feud, took stick in hand here, made that grave gouged line of a keel,  then his broad brow  lifted seaward, in silence, sometimes summoning a shape in memory, and it hove up, and was changed some, they whined, but god knows all they wanted, all he made for them was to be a little unlike the drab hulls of the dead ones, but not too much. like that one yonder!  this was the image he gave them to dream of change, tomorrow only a guess, the sea’s story their life-stink and bow-slam and stillness, and they saw how the fair ones grew, quick riddle-riders our fathers feared, schools that gave us a message sewn on chest, bible, slate, and this worm-holed future entered  blindly as i now have entered his place, feeling for log-char, back-flung gates of light, and the builder. like that one ... the lies begin, each inventing why he should rise up, he should hack out the joy they dream, his pitch boiled, black as mud seaming their legs.  suddenly, i see and take up a cap left as worthless on a stump, its stained round fitting my head like water.  merely to wait where the builder heaved shards and chips and abortive clots to the tide’s tongue-lap is to feel the unconceived shape pulse down his arm, into fingers that took up that stick to let loose the ingathered wilderness of dreams: loon, crow, osprey, gull, the man who cannot believe what he sees, but still sees it.  an immense shadow making over water.  stick in hand, eyes squint. and  there it is, the wind cradling   of an eagle, wing-sails, unfurled, bow-chopping white water head on, a creature now there, now gone. a man, i have to hold my face up, study how air heats, builds a rising push until the high circle of sight skids out everywhere.  dreaming change,  i understand, almost, the problem: is he not harnessed, himself, this light flyer, this father designed to sail like a small god, to screech down upon pine-huddled, hungry chicks he must send off with his lethal, air-buoyed shape? nothing in him asks what is over the wave-edge where our brothers float and sink, lovely shadows, by the millions. putting my back to the sea-worn trunk they have left me, i pull the stick through the dirt, and remember the long line, man-weight in it, and dark-buoyed.  it grows with freckling light, with the answering of birds crying out the only speech we all have above our unfinished country that looms still in the soul, that would bear us hence, out of the water that beats in, out of the water that bore us all here.

 no spring nor summer beauty hath such grace as i have seen in one autumnal face. young beauties force our love, and that's a rape, this doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape. if 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame; affection here takes reverence's name. were her first years the golden age? that's true, but now she's gold oft tried and ever new. that was her torrid and inflaming time, this is her tolerable tropic clime. fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence, he in a fever wishes pestilence. call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were, they were love's graves, for else he is no where. yet lies not love dead here, but here doth sit vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit; and here till hers, which must be his death, come, he doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb. here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere in progress, yet his standing house is here: here where still evening is, not noon nor night, where no voluptuousness, yet all delight. in all her words, unto all hearers fit, you may at revels, you at council, sit. this is love's timber, youth his underwood; there he, as wine in june, enrages blood, which then comes seasonabliest when our taste and appetite to other things is past. xerxes' strange lydian love, the platan tree, was lov'd for age, none being so large as she, or else because, being young, nature did bless her youth with age's glory, barrenness. if we love things long sought, age is a thing which we are fifty years in compassing; if transitory things, which soon decay, age must be loveliest at the latest day. but name not winter faces, whose skin's slack, lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack; whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade; whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made; whose every tooth to a several place is gone, to vex their souls at resurrection: name not these living death's-heads unto me, for these, not ancient, but antique be. i hate extremes, yet i had rather stay with tombs than cradles, to wear out a day. since such love's natural lation is, may still my love descend, and journey down the hill, not panting after growing beauties. so, i shall ebb on with them who homeward go.

 for césar chávez field   the wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth the small, almost invisible scars on my hands.  the pores in my throat and elbows have taken in a seed of dirt of their own.  after a day in the grape fields near rolinda a fine silt, washed by sweat, has settled into the lines on my wrists and palms.  already i am becoming the valley, a soil that sprouts nothing. for any of us.  wind   a dry wind over the valley peeled mountains, grain by grain, to small slopes, loose dirt where red ants tunnel.  the wind strokes the skulls and spines of cattle to white dust, to nothing,  covers the spiked tracks of beetles, of tumbleweed, of sparrows that pecked the ground for insects.  evenings, when i am in the yard weeding, the wind picks up the breath of my armpits like dust, swirls it miles away  and drops it on the ear of a rabid dog, and i take on another life.  wind   when you got up this morning the sun blazed an hour in the sky,  a lizard hid under the curled leaves of manzanita and winked its dark lids.  later, the sky grayed, and the cold wind you breathed was moving under your skin and already far from the small hives of your lungs.  stars   at dusk the first stars appear. not one eager finger points toward them. a little later the stars spread with the night and an orange moon rises to lead them, like a shepherd, toward dawn.  sun   in june the sun is a bonnet of light coming up, little by little, from behind a skyline of pine.  the pastures sway with fiddle-neck, tassels of foxtail.  at piedra a couple fish on the river’s edge, their shadows deep against the water. above, in the stubbled slopes, cows climb down as the heat rises in a mist of blond locusts, returning to the valley.  rain   when autumn rains flatten sycamore leaves, the tiny volcanos of dirt ants raised around their holes, i should be out of work.  my silverware and stack of plates will go unused like the old, my two good slacks will smother under a growth of lint and smell of the old dust that rises when the closet door opens or closes.  the skin of my belly will tighten like a belt and there will be no reason for pockets.  harvest   east of the sun’s slant, in the vineyard that never failed, a wind crossed my face, moving the dust and a portion of my voice a step closer to a new year.  the sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays, and in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me from the thick harvest that was not mine.  fog   if you go to your window you will notice a fog drifting in.  the sun is no stronger than a flashlight. not all the sweaters hung in closets all summer  could soak up this mist. the fog: a mouth nibbling everything to its origin, pomegranate trees, stolen bicycles,  the string of lights at a used-car lot, a pontiac with scorched valves.  in fresno the fog is passing the young thief prying a window screen, graying my hair that falls and goes unfound, my fingerprints slowly growing a fur of dust—  one hundred years from now there should be no reason to believe i lived.  daybreak   in this moment when the light starts up in the east and rubs the horizon until it catches fire,  we enter the fields to hoe, row after row, among the small flags of onion, waving off the dragonflies that ladder the air.  and tears the onions raise do not begin in your eyes but in ours, in the salt blown from one blister into another;  they begin in knowing you will never waken to bear the hour timed to a heart beat, the wind pressing us closer to the ground.  when the season ends, and the onions are unplugged from their sleep, we won’t forget what you failed to see, and nothing will heal under the rain’s broken fingers.

 nytimes headline for september 4th 2012:  elephants dying in epic frenzy as ivory fuels wars and profits they return to the site whence they came with eyes tearful, with psalms trumpeting the air. they stand ever so watchful; guarding the graves of their ghosts and their kind. they shall not forget.  they shall not want. they lie down in green silky pastures and finding their way to the still waters. they restore and nourish their soul. they walk through the dark valleys; always the shadows of death lurking behind them. always striding till they reach the comforting light. they fear no evil.  man fears. they forage for food and they eat amongst their enemies because they fear not.  they are the happiest. the honey is under their tongue. the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. their hearts awaken.  they know no violence. even in the waning light they tower over all else. they are the landscape.  they are the trees. they throw up the dust in their dance.  the skies become misty. they rise up and lead each other away into the dusk.

 the bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked eggs; the weakest are slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented with the blood of deer brought to the pastures by elizabeth’s men—the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate.  the balding queen had bear gardens in london and in the country. the bear is baited: the nostrils are blown full with pepper, the irish wolf dogs are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley:  and the bear’s hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is almost instantly worried by the dogs. at the very moment that elizabeth took essex’s head, a giant brown bear stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . . he took away the sun, took a wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into the white lap of elizabeth i—arrows and staves rained  on his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing into the queen’s private boxes—he grinned into her battered eggshell face. another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth he showered blood all over elizabeth and her privy council.  the very next evening, a cool evening, the queen demanded thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept  all that sunday night and much of the next morning. some said she was guilty of this and that. the protestant queen gave the defeated bear a grave in a catholic cemetery. the marker said: peter, a solstice bear, a gift of the tsarevitch to elizabeth.  after a long winter she had the grave opened. the bear’s skeleton was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside, put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then she spoke to it:  you were a christmas bear—behind your eyes i see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling of your mother’s blood which has dried in your hair; you have troubled a queen who was afraid when seated in shade which, standing, you had created! a queen who often wakes with a dream of you at night— now, you’ll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day you will be in this cold room—your constant grin, you’ll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are,  every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!

 nimble, preserved together, milkweed-white rears upturned,  female tule elk bowed into rustling foxtails.  males muscled over the slopes, jostling mantles, marking terrain.  their antlers clambered wide, steep as the gorges.  as they fed, those branches twitched, sensory, delicate,  yet when one buck reared squaring to look at us  his antlers and his gaze held suddenly motionless.  further out, the skeleton.  the tar paper it seemed to lie on was hide.  vertebrae like redwood stumps— an uneven heart-shaped cavern  where a coccyx curled to its tip. ribs fanned open  hollow, emptied of organs. in the bushes its skull.  sockets and sinuses, mandible, its few small teeth.  all bare now except that fur the red-brown color  of a young boy’s head and also of wild iris stalks in winter  still clung to the drying scalp. below the eye’s rim sagged  flat as a bicycle tire.  the form was sinking away.  the skin loosened, becoming other, shedding the mask that hides  but must also reveal a creature. off amid cliffs and hills  some unfleshed force roamed free. in the wind, i felt  the half-life i watched watch me. elk, i said, i see  you abandon this life, this earth—  i stood for a time with the bones.

 in the lull, the afternoon sun warms the linseed field. the flowers are quiet,  their bright subdued in the green while the mind wanders  to the emerald mosque upon the hill, built around a flowing spring,  the easy absolutions and ablutions in that mosque where the spring water  has been let loose to meander over marble courtyards and inner chambers,  across the geometric, green-tiled floor that cools the heels of the faithful.

 see this house, how dark it is beneath its vast-boughed trees! not one trembling leaflet cries to that watcher in the skies— ‘remove, remove thy searching gaze, innocent of heaven’s ways, brood not, moon, so wildly bright, on secrets hidden from sight.’  ‘secrets,’ sighs the night-wind, ‘vacancy is all i find; every keyhole i have made wails a summons, faint and sad, no voice ever answers me, only vacancy.’ ‘once, once … ’ the cricket shrills, and far and near the quiet fills with its tiny voice, and then hush falls again.  mute shadows creeping slow mark how the hours go. every stone is mouldering slow. and the least winds that blow some minutest atom shake, some fretting ruin make in roof and walls. how black it is beneath these thick boughed trees!

 covet not the sun its honorarium nor authorize the stars their grants to write.  the sojournors spotted a forest adrift with language, but couldn't make sense of it.  the woods at odds with the usual channels and those neighboring mountains  didn't look like pyramids, no matter the scale. read this part as if the sum of lilac  mattered to you. for love of someone else's vortex, toss the luminaries aside.  in lieu of flowers, please donate and in exchange for your sympathy i'll give you  edits on the level of the line. poems are to war as are ghosts to the proverbial orchard.  headstones offer us nothing but an end to syntax. microsoft  word inverts the sea. i read your manuscript. reader, i married it.  i fear for the estuaries. they are so small this time of year.

 1  they go down to the expressways, baskets in hand, they go down with rakes, shovels and watering cans, they go down to pick  beans and trim tomato plants, they go down in wide-brimmed hats and boots, passing by the glass-pickers, the geiger counters, those  guarding the toxic wastes. they go down remembering the glide of automobiles, the swelter of children in back seats, pinching, twitching,  sand in their bathing suits, two-fours of molson’s in the trunk of the car. they go down, past the sifters, the tunnellers, those who transport  soil from deep in the earth, and are content to have the day before them, are content to imagine futures they will inhabit, beautiful futures  filled with unimagined species, new varieties of plant life, sustainable abundance, an idea of sufficient that is global. or,  because cars now move on rails underground, the elevated roads are covered in earth, vines drape around belts of green, snake  through cities, overgrown and teeming with grackles and rats’ nests, a wall of our own devising, and the night  watchmen with their machine guns keeping humans, the intoxicated, out. i am sorry for this version, offer  you coffee, hot while there is still coffee this far north, while there is still news to wake up to, and seasons  vaguely reminiscent of seasons.   2  web-toed she walks into the land, fins carving out river bottoms, each hesitation a lakebed, each mid-afternoon nap, a plateau,  quaint, at least that is my dream of her, big shouldered, out there daydreaming the world into existence, pleasuring herself  with lines and pauses. how else? what is a lake but a pause? people circling it with structures, dipping in their poles? once she thought she could pass by  harmless. scraping wet shale, her knees down in it, she tries to remember earth, that ground cover. she tries to reattach things, but why? what if the world  is all action? what if thought isn’t glue, but tearing? she sits at the lake edge where the water never meets earth, never touches, not really, is always pulling  itself on to the next.   3  now she sits by her memory of meadow, forlorn, shoeless. she could scoop pcbs from the hudson, she is always picking up after someone. but what? what  is the primary trope of this romp? where her uterus was the smell of buckshot and tar, an old man chasing her with a shotgun across his range. cow pies and  hornets’ nests, gangly boys shooting cats with bb guns, boys summering from calgary, trees hollowed out, hiding all manner of contraband goods. when she peers  in the knotted oak, classic movies run on the hour, scout on the dark bark, mildred pierce with a squirrel tale wrap. nature is over,  she concludes. nature is what is caught, cellular, celluloid. she sticks a thumb in another tree, a brownstone, a small girl—her heart a thing locked.  it’s been so long since she felt hopeful. (perhaps nature is childhood.) the morning after chernobyl out there with tiny umbrellas. all those internal  combustions. this is a country that has accepted death as an industry, it is not news. she has been warned. her ratings sag. she scans her least apocalyptic  self and sees mariners floating, ben franklin penning daily axioms, glasses lifting from the river bank, planked skirts on front,  china-like through the industrious, thinking, traffic clogged city, its brick heavy with desire for good. memory of meadow, dickinson an ice pick scratching  wings in her brain: if you see her standing, if you move too quickly, if you locate the centre, if you have other opportunities, by all means if you have other opportunities.   4  abondoned mine shafts on either side, those tight curves between kaslo and new denver, hairpin at glacial creek, splash of red  bellies muscling, streaming up, we see them from the open window. or once did. even here? salmon stocks diminish, mammals dying off.  no, he said, not in your lifetime. vertical; traces where the charge went off, ruggedness is your only defence, he  said, be difficult to cultivate, navigate. offer no hint of paradise, no whiff of golf course. uninhabitability your only  recourse. lashed, that moment, prolonged leaving, her father on the roadside dreaming his world fitting in some place,  without being reigned in, her father’s fathers throwing rocks down on hannibal, straddling the last large elm in the valley,  knowing where and how to lay the charge, or sucking shrapnel from an open wound, the lambs all around, bleating.   5  which liftetime? beyond what brawn? who knew where the road would take us? neat, neat, the rows of apple trees  there in the valley, red summers, the heat of quebecois pickers, vws in a circle, firepit and strum. men from thetford  mines dreaming peaches, dreaming clean soil. hour upon hour the self becomes less aware of the self.  beautiful, beautiful, the centre line, the road, this power station and control tower, these weigh scales, these curves, that mountain  goat, those cut lines, these rail lines, that canyon, the fraser, the thompson, the old highways hyphenating  sagebrush, dead-ending on chain link, old cars collecting like bugs on the roadside, overturned, curled, astute,  memory of the overlanders, optimism, headlong into hell’s gate. churn of now,  the sound barriers, the steering wheel, the gas pedal, the gearshift, the dice dangling, fuzzy,  teal, dual ashtrays, am radio tuned to cbc, no draft, six cylinders, the gas tank, the gearshift, easing  into the sweet spot behind the semi, flying through roger’s pass; the snowplow, the park  pass, sun on mud flap, the rest stop rock slides, glint of snow, the runaway lanes, the grades steep as skyscrapers,  the road cutting through cities, slicing towns, dividing parks, the road over lakes, under rivers,  the road right through a redwood, driving on top of cities, all eyes on the dvd screen,  all minds on the cellphone, the safari not around, but inside us: that which fuels.   6  no matter, the slither of pavement is endless, today the rain, a gold standard, all the earmarks of, never mind, all is well, all  is well, and who doesn’t want to hear that? she gets on her scooter and roars, she gets on her skateboard and feels the air under  foot, she shakes out her hair, thinking of california, thinking of allergies, thinking of the wreck of place: who ever promised more? the iris  with its feigned restraint, the daring tuba, the horn of shoe, utilitarian, delicate. such useful domesticity, such hopeful electronics.  once she disappeared by turning sideways. now she finds it difficult to reappear. she lifts the sediment of time to her palm, feels it sift  between her fingers: bone, bits of event. aren’t we all a bit fluish this century? nothing bearing any mark of otherwise. no prescript, nothing a bit of hope  won’t cure. such a churn of optimism: that which consecrates will not kill. maybe new york? she fits herself on an easterly course: been done,  been done, but what better than the well-trodden path? beautiful, beautiful, the seams of the rich, their folded linens,  their soft bags of money. if it ain’t broke don’t fix, if it ain’t resistant, don’t wince, if it fits like a boot, then boot it.  and so she does.

 this rose-tree is not made to bear the violet blue, nor lily fair, nor the sweet mignionet: and if this tree were discontent, or wished to change its natural bent, it all in vain would fret.  and should it fret, you would suppose it ne’er had seen its own red rose, nor after gentle shower had ever smelled its rose’s scent, or it could ne’er be discontent with its own pretty flower.  like such a blind and senseless tree as i’ve imagined this to be, all envious persons are: with care and culture all may find some pretty flower in their own mind, some talent that is rare.

 for this she starred her eyes with salt and scooped her temples thin, until her face shone pure of fault from the forehead to the chin.  in coldest crucibles of pain her shrinking flesh was fired and smoothed into a finer grain to make it more desired.  pain left her lips more clear than glass; it colored and cooled her hand. she lay a field of scented grass yielded as pasture land.  for this her loveliness was curved and carved as silver is: for this she was brave: but she deserved a better grave than this.

 how it must have been for them, when wind came to strike cottonwoods they called home down  —silver bridges across a gun-smoke creek-bed, joining yellow meadow to meadow...how it must have been  like the beginning of time, when the first one beat great wings (though so silent a field mouse  would never even hear before talons sinking in...) and rose over the blues to find this valley with others  following. and their human eyes, forward-gazing in their round faces, they turned toward sound  to catch it in feather discs, their hearing tuned beyond human imagining...and then they were gone, like  mist dissipating in the lowlands, and an eye trained toward their going might, squinting, distinguish  signs of intention written by pinions, stroking damp air in their westward rowing. and we told ourselves  all water eventually finds the sea—our coming, their going—so synchronous; this was simply something  we wanted, more than knowing, wholly to believe.

 evening! as slow thy placid shades descend, veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still, the lonely battlement, the farthest hill and wood, i think of those who have no friend; who now, perhaps, by melancholy led, from the broad blaze of day, where pleasure flaunts, retiring, wander to the ring-dove’s haunts unseen; and watch the tints that o’er thy bed hang lovely; oft to musing fancy’s eye presenting fairy vales, where the tir’d mind might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind, nor hear the hourly moans of misery! alas for man! that hope’s fair views the while should smile like you, and perish as they smile!

 slade was pulling minnows out of the dry river the day we met. puddles, more or less, was what was left. but what could live wanted to and tried, treading narrow circles, a glide of brittle ﬁns. he wore those rubber boots, though the sun was an anvil, and very little wet; he smiled, i remember that, his nickel smile right at me, his ﬁngers letting fall the small ﬁsh muscles into a bag ﬁlled with yellow tap. i didn’t ask his name, or what it was he thought he was doing, but we talked, i listened as he taught me to relax the hand just enough. they can smell, he said, the oils our pores release when we tense to catch. you have to believe it, he said. you don’t mean any harm.

 everyone suddenly burst out singing; and i was filled with such delight as prisoned birds must find in freedom, winging wildly across the white orchards and dark-green fields; on - on - and out of sight.  everyone's voice was suddenly lifted; and beauty came like the setting sun: my heart was shaken with tears; and horror drifted away ... o, but everyone was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.  
NEW POEM
 when the river rose that year, we were beside it and ourselves with fear; not that it would do anything to us, mind you—our hopes were much too high for that— but there was always that remote, unacknowledged possibility that we had thrown one stone too many, by the handful, and that by some force of nature, as they called it, it might rain and rain for days, as it had been, with nothing to hold it and the structure back, and with everything to blame, including children on into late summer and all the years ahead, when it would be ours to bear, to do much more with than remember and let it go at that—some mud, some driftwood, some space of sky as a reminder before getting on with the world again; no, the balance was ours to share, and responsibility for rivers had as much to do with anything as rain on the roof and sweet fish for supper, as forests and trembling and berries at sunrise; thus it was, then, that we kept our watch, that we kept our wits about us and all the respect we could muster, sitting in silence, sleeping in shifts, and when the fire died, everyone was there to keep it alive; somehow, though, in the middle of the night, despite our vigils, our dreams, our admonitions, our structure, our people, and all our belongings broke free with a shudder and went drifting away— past the landing, the swing, the anchored cages, down through the haunted rapids, never to be found; when we awoke that morning, the sun was back, the river had receded under our measuring stick, and everything had been astonishingly replaced, including people and pets, the structure intact, but in the solitude of all our faces as we ate, the knowledge was there, of what we all had done, and that everything would never be the same.  
NEW POEM
 by the stream, where the ground is soft and gives, under the slightest pressure—even the fly would leave its footprint here and the paw of the shrew the crescent of its claws like the strokes of a chisel in clay; where the lightest chill, lighter than the least rumor of winter, sets the reeds to a kind of speaking, and a single drop of rain leaves a crater to catch the first silver glint of sun when the clouds slide away from each other like two tired lovers, and the light returns, pale, though brightened by the last chapter of late autumn: copper, rusted oak, gold aspen, and the red pages of maple, the wind leafing through to the end the annals of beech, the slim volumes of birch, the elegant script of the ferns ...  for the birds, it is all notations for a coda, for the otter an invitation to the river, and for the deer—a dream in which to disappear, light-footed on the still open book of earth, adding the marks of their passage, adding it all in, waiting only for the first thick flurry of snowflakes for cover, soft cover that carries no title, no name.

 fingers: cramped, you are hardly anything but fidgets. we, active, differentiate the digits: whilst you are merely little toe and big (or, in the nursery, some futile pig) through vital use as pincers there has come distinction of the finger and the thumb; lacking a knuckle you have sadly missed our meaningful translation to a fist; and only by the curling of that joint could the firm index come to have a point. you cannot punch or demonstrate or hold and therefore cannot write or pluck or mould: indeed, it seems deficiency in art alone would prove you the inferior part.  toes: not so, my friends. our clumsy innocence and your deft sin is the main difference between the body’s near extremities. please do not think that we intend to please: shut in the dark, we once were free like you. though you enslaved us, are you not slaves, too? our early balance caused your later guilt, erect, of finding out how we were built. your murders and discoveries compile a history of the crime of being agile, and we it is who save you when you fight against the odds: you cannot take to flight. despite your fabrications and your cunning, the deepest instinct is expressed in running.

 for kwame dawes your scuttled pays floats—fiery—in the ether; blazing, it vomits smudge-smoke. your mind chars black because you yaw—moth-like—too near flames. you douse your dream-scorched brain with slave-sweat rum— the only gold you can own, corroding your liver. your anthem plays to gunfire. when you think about it (when you can breathe)— after all the lies that frame nostalgia, all the dead faces that occupy photographs, all the slain lovers pitched into ditches, your eyes itch and ache with water, then dry— curling like dead leaves, starving for gold fire.

 imagine a child from virginia or new hampshire alone on the prairie eighty years ago or more, one afternoon—the shaggy pelt of grasses, for the first time in that child’s life, flowing for miles. imagine the moving shadow of a cloud far off across that shadeless ocean, the obliterating strangeness like a tide that pulls or empties the bubble of the child’s imaginary heart. no hills, no trees.  the child’s heart lightens, tending like a bubble towards the currents of the grass and sky, the pure potential of the clear blank spaces.  or, imagine the child in a draw that holds a garden cupped from the limitless motion of the prairie, head resting against a pumpkin, in evening sun. ground-cherry bushes grow along the furrows, the fruit red under its papery, moth-shaped sheath. grasshoppers tumble among the vines, as large as dragons in the crumbs of pale dry earth. the ground is warm to the child’s cheek, and the wind is a humming sound in the grass above the draw, rippling the shadows of the red-green blades. the bubble of the child’s heart melts a little, because the quiet of that air and earth is like the shadow of a peaceful death— limitless and potential; a kind of space where one dissolves to become a part of something entire ... whether of sun and air, or goodness and knowledge, it does not matter to the child. dissolved among the particles of the garden or into the motion of the grass and air, imagine the child happy to be a thing.  imagine, then, that on that same wide prairie some people are threshing in the terrible heat with horses and machines, cutting bands and shoveling amid the clatter of the threshers, the chaff in prickly clouds and the naked sun burning as if it could set the chaff on fire. imagine that the people are swedes or germans, some of them resting pressed against the strawstacks, trying to get the meager shade. a man, a tramp, comes laboring across the stubble like a mirage against that blank horizon, laboring in his torn shoes toward the tall mirage-like images of the tilted threshers clattering in the heat. because the swedes or germans have no beer, or else because they cannot speak his language properly, or for some reason one cannot imagine, the man climbs up on a thresher and cuts bands a minute or two, then waves to one of the people, a young girl or a child, and jumps head-first into the sucking mouth of the machine, where he is wedged and beat and cut to pieces— while the people shout and run in the clouds of chaff, like lost mirages on the pelt of prairie.  the obliterating strangeness and the spaces are as hard to imagine as the love of death ... which is the love of an entire strangeness, the contagious blankness of a quiet plain. imagine that a man, who had seen a prairie, should write a poem about a dark or shadow that seemed to be both his, and the prairie’s—as if the shadow proved that he was not a man, but something that lived in quiet, like the grass. imagine that the man who writes that poem, stunned by the loneliness of that wide pelt, should prove to himself that he was like a shadow or like an animal living in the dark. in the dark proof he finds in his poem, the man might come to think of himself as the very prairie, the sod itself, not lonely, and immune to death.  none of this happens precisely as i try to imagine that it does, in the empty plains, and yet it happens in the imagination of part of the country: not in any place more than another, on the map, but rather like a place, where you and i have never been and need to try to imagine—place like a prairie where immigrants, in the obliterating strangeness, thirst for the wide contagion of the shadow or prairie—where you and i, with our other ways, more like the cities or the hills or trees, less like the clear blank spaces with their potential, are like strangers in a place we must imagine.  
NEW POEM
 to adam z you asked me last summer: “what is a doily?” sometimes, at lunch, i walk on the beach. today i was coatless. a storm cloud threatened, dark as a spaceship. should it pour, a sister ship down in the water would throw up grappling nets to the surface, rain rise to soak me. behind a sandbank, waves touched the shore, no more than a shimmer.  less rare than its cousin, the antimacassar, a doily’s placed between sweet thing and china. both survive where vicars arrive for tea, are given thin cup and saucer instead of a mug. if your cake’s so rich that it’s leaking syrup, you’ll need a doily. held up, its paper’s the filigree of snowflake, or fingers looked through in fear.  the shower holds off. my shoe’s a doily. without it, where would i be on these shells that crunch underfoot, like contact lenses, as i gingerly walk, on my mermaid way back to my husband in his human dwelling?  someone is pulling a blue toy trawler along the horizon to port, so smoothly it looks realistic. sea’s partly doily. surfers ride its lace to their downfall, after all, we’re nothing but froth. like a carpet salesman, the indolent tide flops a wave over, showing samples: “madam, this one is durable, has a fringe.” under its breath the sea sighs, “has it come to this? must everything always end in ... doily?”  it must. broad afternoon. the rain-cloud barges have passed and here’s a cumulonimbus parade of imperial busts, the roman rulers in historical order which, i think, would please you. their vapor curls and noble foreheads are lit up in lilac because they’re invading the west. next come the philosophers and, last of all, the poets. pulleys draw them delicately on. here comes lucretius, then ovid, then horace in lines, saying relentlessly, “doily,” “doily,” till stars take over and do the same.

 it had almost nothing to do with sex. the boy in his corset and farthingale, his head-  voice and his smooth-for-the-duration chin was not and never had been simply in our pay. or  was it some lost logic the regional accent restores? a young welsh actor may play a reluctant  laborer playing thisby botching similes and stop our hearts with wonder. my young friend  he’s seven—touched his mother’s face last night and said it’s wet and, making the connection he has had  to learn by rote,you’re sad. it’s never not like this for him.as if,  the adolescents mouth wherever california spills its luminous vernacular.as if, until  the gesture holds, or passes. let’s just say we’ll live here for a while. o  habitus. o wall. o moon. for my young friend it’s never not some labored  simulacrum, every tone of voice, each give, each take is wrested from an unrelenting social  dark. there’s so much dark to go around (how odd to be this and no other and, like all  the others, marked for death), it’s a wonder we pass for locals at all. take thisby for instance:  minutes ago she was fretting for lack of a beard and now she weeps for a lover slain by a minute’s  misreading. reader, it’s sharp as the lion’s tooth. who takes  the weeping away now takes delight as well, which feels for all the world like honest  work. they’ve never worked with mind before, the rich man says. but moonlight says,with flesh.

 ray’s third new car in half as many years. full cooler in the trunk, ray sogging the beer as i solemnly chauffeur us through the bush and up the backroads, hardly cowpaths and hub-deep in mud. all day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again. somewhere in the bush near saint john there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother who stayed on the land when ray left for the cities. one week ray is crocked. we’ve been through this before. even, as a little girl, hands in my dress, ah punka, you’s my debby, come and ki me.   then the road ends in a yard full of dogs. them’s indian dogs, ray says, lookit how they know me. and they do seem to know him, like i do. his odor— rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from metagoshe, and the inflammable mansmell: hair tonic, ashes, alcohol. ray dances an old woman up in his arms. fiddles reel in the phonograph and i sink apart in a corner, start knocking the blue ribbons down. four generations of people live here. no one remembers raymond twobears.  so what. the walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud sails back into the middle of metagoshe. a three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline, so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine. then somehow ray pries the beak open and shoves down a cherry bomb. lights the string tongue.  headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow’s soup. ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in to sleep his own head off. tomorrow i find that the animal has dragged itself off. i follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh.  ray finds his way back through the room into his arms. when the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands and the boys and their old man fold him into the car where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out.  somehow we find our way back. uncle ray sings an old song to the body that pulls him toward home. the gray fins that his hands have become screw their bones in the dashboard. his face has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived for a long time underwater. and the angels come lowering their slings and litters.  
NEW POEM
 ever let the fancy roam, pleasure never is at home: at a touch sweet pleasure melteth, like to bubbles when rain pelteth; then let winged fancy wander through the thought still spread beyond her: open wide the mind's cage-door, she'll dart forth, and cloudward soar. o sweet fancy! let her loose; summer's joys are spoilt by use, and the enjoying of the spring fades as does its blossoming; autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too, blushing through the mist and dew, cloys with tasting: what do then? sit thee by the ingle, when the sear faggot blazes bright, spirit of a winter's night; when the soundless earth is muffled, and the caked snow is shuffled from the ploughboy's heavy shoon; when the night doth meet the noon in a dark conspiracy to banish even from her sky. sit thee there, and send abroad, with a mind self-overaw'd, fancy, high-commission'd:—send her! she has vassals to attend her: she will bring, in spite of frost, beauties that the earth hath lost; she will bring thee, all together, all delights of summer weather; all the buds and bells of may, from dewy sward or thorny spray; all the heaped autumn's wealth, with a still, mysterious stealth: she will mix these pleasures up like three fit wines in a cup, and thou shalt quaff it:—thou shalt hear distant harvest-carols clear; rustle of the reaped corn; sweet birds antheming the morn: and, in the same moment, hark! 'tis the early april lark, or the rooks, with busy caw, foraging for sticks and straw. thou shalt, at one glance, behold the daisy and the marigold; white-plum'd lillies, and the first hedge-grown primrose that hath burst; shaded hyacinth, alway sapphire queen of the mid-may; and every leaf, and every flower pearled with the self-same shower. thou shalt see the field-mouse peep meagre from its celled sleep; and the snake all winter-thin cast on sunny bank its skin; freckled nest-eggs thou shalt see hatching in the hawthorn-tree, when the hen-bird's wing doth rest quiet on her mossy nest; then the hurry and alarm when the bee-hive casts its swarm; acorns ripe down-pattering, while the autumn breezes sing.  oh, sweet fancy! let her loose; every thing is spoilt by use: where's the cheek that doth not fade, too much gaz'd at? where's the maid whose lip mature is ever new? where's the eye, however blue, doth not weary? where's the face one would meet in every place? where's the voice, however soft, one would hear so very oft? at a touch sweet pleasure melteth like to bubbles when rain pelteth. let, then, winged fancy find thee a mistress to thy mind: dulcet-ey'd as ceres' daughter, ere the god of torment taught her how to frown and how to chide; with a waist and with a side white as hebe's, when her zone slipt its golden clasp, and down fell her kirtle to her feet, while she held the goblet sweet and jove grew languid.—break the mesh of the fancy's silken leash; quickly break her prison-string and such joys as these she'll bring.— let the winged fancy roam, pleasure never is at home.

 the city and the continent trail off into cold black water the same way: at the western edge, a flat stretch with precipitous planes set perpendicular and back from the beach or beach-equivalent, a blacktop margin where the drugged and dying trudge, queue up for hades. bolinas had its junkie lady with gray skin, gray sweater, stumbling through the sand with the short- burst intensity and long-run aimlessness of crackhead hustlers on the west street piers. dreams of bolinas haunted me for years before i saw it. i’d huddle at the foot of the cliff in a cold wind late at night, wrapped in indian blankets, waiting with strangers as the tidal wave or temblor hit. tonight i walk with old friends in a new dream past a vest-pocket park of great formality and charm in the far west village. my disaffected former confidant has grown a pony tail and cruises up the street on a “hog,” a “chopper,” which seems a perfect locomotive choice. i walk out to the quay where gondola after enormous gondola departs for “the other side,” not new jersey anymore, anymore than something prosaic as another mass of land past the bright horizon could function as a mirror of the chopped-away bolinas hill. o western edge, where points of interest on maps of individual hearts and bodies disappear in waters of a depth unfathomable even in a dream, i had thought that sleep was meant to blunt your sharpness, not to hone and polish with the lapping of the hungry waves of lethe.

 my father’s farm is an apple blossomer. he keeps his hills in dandelion carpet and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose and the jack-in-the-pulpits. his sleek cows ripple in the pastures. the dog and purple iris keep watch at the garden’s end.  his farm is rolling thunder, a lightning bolt on the horizon. his crops suck rain from the sky and swallow the smoldering sun. his fields are oceans of heat, where waves of gold beat the burning shore.  a red fox pauses under the birch trees, a shadow is in the river’s bend. when the hawk circles the land, my father’s grainfields whirl beneath it. owls gather together to sing in his woods, and the deer run his golden meadow.  my father’s farm is an icicle, a hillside of white powder. he parts the snowy sea, and smooths away the valleys. he cultivates his rows of starlight and drags the crescent moon through dark unfurrowed fields.

 as the stores close, a winter light opens air to iris blue, glint of frost through the smoke grains of mica, salt of the sidewalk. as the buildings close, released autonomous feet pattern the streets in hurry and stroll; balloon heads drift and dive above them; the bodies aren't really there. as the lights brighten, as the sky darkens, a woman with crooked heels says to another woman while they step along at a fair pace, "you know, i'm telling you, what i love best is life. i love life! even if i ever get to be old and wheezy—or limp! you know? limping along?—i'd still ...

 fie pleasure, fie! thou cloyest me with delight, thou fill’st my mouth with sweetmeats overmuch; i wallow still in joy both day and night: i deem, i dream, i do, i taste, i touch, no thing but all that smells of perfect bliss; fie pleasure, fie! i cannot like of this.  to taste (sometimes) a bait of bitter gall, to drink a draught of soür ale (some season) to eat brown bread with homely hands in hall, doth much increase men’s appetites, by reason, and makes the sweet more sugar’d that ensues, since minds of men do still seek after news.  the pamper’d horse is seldom seen in breath, whose manger makes his grace (oftimes) to melt; the crammed fowl comes quickly to his death; such colds they catch in hottest haps that swelt; and i (much like) in pleasure scawled still, do fear to starve although i feed my fill.  it might suffice that love hath built his bower between my lady’s lively shining eyes; it were enough that beauty’s fading flower grows ever fresh with her in heavenly wise; it had been well that she were fair of face, and yet not rob all other dames of grace.  to muse in mind, how wise, how fair, how good, how brave, how frank, how courteous, and how true my lady is, doth but inflame my blood with humours such as bid my health adieu; since hap always when it is clomb on high, doth fall full low, though erst it reach’d the sky.  lo, pleasure, lo! lo thus i lead a life that laughs for joy, and trembleth oft for dread; thy pangs are such as call for change’s knife to cut the twist, or else to stretch the thread, which holds yfeer the bundle of my bliss: fie, pleasure, fie! i dare not trust to this.  
NEW POEM
 [sarouk]  we buy what we cannot control, the rugs, rhythm-makers, containing refrains of the oldest story: a man takes a journey. i have no stories inside me, he says, so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet of blue constellations, star patterns at the edges of disordered border walls. at the center, a meditative medallion makes a moving immortal-flowered ground: to live there is to give oneself over to greenness, redness, occasional blues, holding those spirits of woollen dyes rising from the knots within to breathe against the woven, multi-colored air.   [bidjar]  now there is a coat of many colors hung around the wanderer's shoulders where he climbs out from that pit, down which he flung himself, or was thrown into. reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds the dusts of centuries residing there beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers passing, wearing thin, fighting about how best to articulate the names of gods for whom they yearn—accursed by wars' helmet curves, shields, chained stitches of unmediated reds and yellowed husks of blood—broken lines marking a garden in whose precincts his journey began.   [kazak]  three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies through golden latchhooks, surrounding cloudbanks; three eagles, darting within their shifting images: they return him to streets of lit porches in summer dark, a boy stuttering over random syllables, a blindfolded man pleading for his life— whose fate is in the hands of some men whose fate is in the hands of other men, whose fate . . . until the whole pattern emerges, and the language becomes clear. on the floor lies his mother, moaning, until he comes out, guilty, before her— amid the mud of his own frozen blood.   [shirvan]  to live inside such squares as the weaver of this green, becoming golden, labor; to pull back old skins and try to emerge, victorious, from that old prison after so many years, is to find a path back to harmonious designs, surely centered on the search—yet still speaking of a life with knotted figures seen as suffering variations on themes that can be inferred from small vibrations of weft and warp, the ‘snakes' within the threads worn down to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms writhing in a loom of days: those humming ancient instruments whose music seems   [shiraz]  raw as colors governed by the earth, pink as brick, or deserts scraped from rock, rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting down the slopes of the central plateaus to fresh respites from thinner regions of dessication fixed at the fringes below. these lands lie under the ache of desire, which calls feet out to play upon sand, to fill each new hollow, and dance about, tongues turning on the knots of umber, ochre, woven into those undulating waves others might summon in flowery manners to escape from bitter orange, still held by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple   [kerman]  empowering all those who try to hold on— as all things will hold to themselves an idea of themselves—to an aspiration towards good fortune, unwavering even unto death. yet here are dusky passages, canopies of clearness, an everlasting understanding of the earth as cancerous points of coloration, acid starbursts, or dangerous blots—all blurring the way to move past sight: perspectives lost and found again, symmetrical, surrounded by the momentos one saves from travel, old friends, like hues that may betoken, in hopefulness, some changes of heart.   [senneh]  this creates a powerful language about how to levitate a plane—for even as the occasional murmurs of new machines are heard in the land, as old cyclic gardens arrange themselves in the whorls and tendrils throughout tilled fields, snakes hold up this world in variations of light blue skies above temptation. even when an illiterate weaver mistakes an old date for the design, then dyes and binds strange numbers into a ground, the change of the serif, for instance, in a calligraphy of days marks the date of cartouches as mysterious, unknown.   [kashan]  yet the signals from the borders suggest a different tale: lozenges are bottles strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads, shaped like a woman found lying along the side of those same roads—the figure of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly back on itself—as a web of years frames a dying kind of certitude, innocence. the birds in these cages signify singing, as the tapestries of perfected threads suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries to the indeterminancy of all creation:  and we can buy it yet, articulate or not, with each new freeing of our hearts.

 maple leaves turn black in the courtyard. light drives lower and one bluejay crams our cold memories out past the sun,  each time your traces come past the shadows and visit under my looking-glass fingers that lift and block out the sun.  come—i’ll trace you one final autumn, and you can trace your last homecoming into the snow or the sun.

 devereux farm, near marblehead. we sat within the farm-house old, whose windows, looking o'er the bay, gave to the sea-breeze damp and cold, an easy entrance, night and day.  not far away we saw the port, the strange, old-fashioned, silent town, the lighthouse, the dismantled fort, the wooden houses, quaint and brown.  we sat and talked until the night, descending, filled the little room; our faces faded from the sight, our voices only broke the gloom.  we spake of many a vanished scene, of what we once had thought and said, of what had been, and might have been, and who was changed, and who was dead;  and all that fills the hearts of friends, when first they feel, with secret pain, their lives thenceforth have separate ends, and never can be one again;  the first slight swerving of the heart, that words are powerless to express, and leave it still unsaid in part, or say it in too great excess.  the very tones in which we spake had something strange, i could but mark; the leaves of memory seemed to make a mournful rustling in the dark.  oft died the words upon our lips, as suddenly, from out the fire built of the wreck of stranded ships, the flames would leap and then expire.  and, as their splendor flashed and failed, we thought of wrecks upon the main, of ships dismasted, that were hailed and sent no answer back again.  the windows, rattling in their frames, the ocean, roaring up the beach, the gusty blast, the bickering flames, all mingled vaguely in our speech;  until they made themselves a part of fancies floating through the brain, the long-lost ventures of the heart, that send no answers back again.  o flames that glowed! o hearts that yearned! they were indeed too much akin, the drift-wood fire without that burned, the thoughts that burned and glowed within.  
NEW POEM
 the lights come on and stay on under the trees. visibly a whole neighborhood inhabits the dusk, so punctual and in place it seems to deny dark its dominion. nothing will go astray, the porch lamps promise. sudden, as though a match failed to ignite at the foot of the garden, the first squibs trouble the eye. impossible not to share that sportive, abortive, clumsy, where-are-we-now dalliance with night, such soothing relentlessness. what should we make of fireflies, their quick flare of promise and disappointment, their throwaway style? our heads turn this way and that. we are loath to miss such jauntiness in nature. those fugitive selves, winged and at random! our flickery might-have-beens come up form the woods to haunt us! our yet-to-be as tentative frolic! what do fireflies say? that loneliness made of light becomes at last convivial singleness? that any antic spark cruising the void might titillate creation? and whether they spend themselves, or go to ground, or drift with their lights out, they have left the gloom, for as long as our eyes take to absorb such absence, less than it seemed, as childless and deprived as chaos and old night. but ruffled, too, as though it unearthed some memory of light from its long blackout, a hospitable core fit home for fireflies, brushed by fireflies' wings.  
NEW POEM
 the day my body caught fire the woodland darkened. the horizon was a sea of maids, rushing to piece me back into a girl. out of the girl came yellow flowers, came stem &amp; sepal. you never happened, they said. the meadow was a narration of lessness. inside the corral, horses fell from the impact of lightning. they broke down. i heard gunshots in my sleep. i was a keeper of breath, of hay. i walked a field, collecting bones. you can build a house out of bones. you can stand at the doorway quarrelling with your legs to enter or run until you turn to ash.  
NEW POEM
 afterwards you had that drunk, drugged look my daughter used to get, when she had let go of my nipple, her mouth gone slack and her eyes turned vague and filmy, as though behind them the milk was rising up to fill her whole head, that would loll on the small white stalk of her neck so i would have to hold her closer, amazed at the sheer power of satiety, which was nothing like the needing to be fed, the wild flailing and crying until she fastened herself to me and made the seal tight between us, and sucked, drawing the liquid down and out of my body; no,this was the crowning moment, this giving of herself, knowing she could show me how helpless she was—that’s what i saw, that night when you pulled your mouth from mine and leaned back against a chain-link fence, in front of a burned-out church: a man who was going to be that vulnerable, that easy and impossible to hurt.

 "the eagle has landed!" —apollo ii commander neil a. armstrong "a magnificent desolation!" — air force colonel edwin e. "buzz" aldrin, jr. july 20, 1969 that afternoon in mid-july, two pilgrims watched from distant space the moon ballooning in the sky. they rose to meet it face-to-face.  their spidery spaceship,eagle, dropped down gently on the lunar sand. and when the module's engines stopped, rapt silence fell across the land.  the first man down the ladder, neil, spoke words that we remember now— “one small step...” it made us feel as if we were there too, somehow.  when neil planted the flag and buzz collected lunar rocks and dust, they hopped like kangaroos because of gravity. or wanderlust?  a quarter million miles away, one small blue planet watched in awe. and no one who was there that day will soon forget the sight they saw.

 i have never been fishing on the susquehanna or on any river for that matter to be perfectly honest.  not in july or any month have i had the pleasure—if it is a pleasure— of fishing on the susquehanna.  i am more likely to be found in a quiet room like this one— a painting of a woman on the wall,  a bowl of tangerines on the table— trying to manufacture the sensation of fishing on the susquehanna.  there is little doubt that others have been fishing on the susquehanna,  rowing upstream in a wooden boat, sliding the oars under the water then raising them to drip in the light.  but the nearest i have ever come to fishing on the susquehanna was one afternoon in a museum in philadelphia  when i balanced a little egg of time in front of a painting in which that river curled around a bend  under a blue cloud-ruffled sky, dense trees along the banks, and a fellow with a red bandanna  sitting in a small, green flat-bottom boat holding the thin whip of a pole.  that is something i am unlikely ever to do, i remember saying to myself and the person next to me.  then i blinked and moved on to other american scenes of haystacks, water whitening over rocks,  even one of a brown hare who seemed so wired with alertness i imagined him springing right out of the frame.

 the night mist leaves us yearning for a new location to things impossibly stationary, the way they’d once float houses made from dismantled ships, brass and timber, from plymouth, massachusetts, across the sound to white horse beach. you were only a boy.  years later, gazing out to the red buoys of the harbor, you sought those houses, each the location of your childhood’s end. jon, i make this all sound too complex. our view of time is stationary, a long prediction of remorse. we’re drinking in timber, camping above tucson, arizona. below, the houses  are vague points of light, describing a grief you’ve housed since watching those buildings careen on water, a boy too sullen for your father. so the aspens creak like timber in an aging sloop. the others sleep. you locate the figure of your son, small and stationary, but tell me he’ll die young, body unsound,  a childhood diabetic. the bourbon makes you sound entranced—to think one day you’ll return to the house to find that you’ve outlived him, maybe the radio station playing some popular song. outliving the boy, you’ll outlive yourself. drunk, we’ve lost our location. i shine my flashlight to find the others. the timbre  of your voice grows slack. leaves and timber rustle in the promise of rain, in the sound of distant thunder that, like death, has no location. below, relentless clouds will cover houses. the campfire sputters, then grows, buoyed by wind, our bodies the only things stationary.  because of death, our small, unstationary lives become narration—a child is lost in timber in a fable when night approaches. the boy can’t even see his hands. only owl-cry, the sound of his heart. but soon the aspens part, the houses of his village appear, their location  precise and consoling. he’s stationary, not a sound from below. beyond the timber, floating houses. and there his papa’s lantern, a light the boy can locate.

 down the path between the apples through the maple grove of suicides then left at the old wall along the wire fence to the brook- bank where narcissus noses into skunk cabbage and hepatica: call me apollo, crashing in the underbrush with my arrows, my bow saw and clippers out for your flash of white tail and alert to hack me a path to your lair, to your cult’s den, crisscrossing the water with phoebe again and again as it elbows below us and runs for the creek racks strongest in springtime when everything’s liquid, tightroping over the rocks in the plashing braid, hot on your sharp scent and battling the mayflies the black flies horseflies mosquitoes there under the raspberry brambles and getting no nearer . . .  or am i fleeing your coiling uncoiling tentacular embrace battered and scarred, am i seeing your fabled face in the oily pools, are these fern hairs sprouting at your knuckles branchbones, little leaves halving our limbs with leaves—are they yours or mine? your bloodhounds bay at the copper creek, your velvet cape’s aloft in the chiaroscuro breeze, you’re near, nearer, hieing, heying, i’m falling, failing, gashed, gutted, kneed-up, muddy and galled—call me actaeon....

 like bodiless water passing in a sigh, thro’ palsied streets the fatal shadows flow, and in their sharp disastrous undertow suck in the morning sun, and all the sky. the towery vista sinks upon the eye, as if it heard the hebrew bugles blow, black and dissolved; nor could the founders know how what was built so bright should daily die.  thy mood with man’s is broken and blent in, city of stains! and ache of thought doth drown the primitive light in which thy life began; great as thy dole is, smirchèd with his sin, greater and elder yet the love of man full in thy look, tho’ the dark visor’s down.

NEW POEM
 “who is apollo?” college student how shall a generation know its story if it will know no other? when, among the scoffers at the institute, pasteur heard one deny the cause of child-birth fever, indignantly he drew upon the blackboard, for all to see, the streptococcus chain. his mind was like odysseus and plato exploring a new cosmos in the old as if he wrote a poem—his enemy suffering, disease, and death, the battleground his introspection. “science and peace,” he said, “will win out over ignorance and war,” but then, the virus mutant in his vein, “death to the prussian!” and “revenge, revenge!”  how shall my generation tell its story? their fathers jobless, boys for the ccc  and nya , the future like a stairwell to floors without a window or a door, and then the army: bayonet drill and foxhole; bombing to rubble cities with textbook names later to bulldoze streets for; their green bodies drowned in the greener surfs of rumored france. my childhood friend, george humphreys, whom i still see still ten years old, his uncombed hair and grin moment by moment in the hürtgen dark until the one step full in the sniper’s sight, his pastor father emptied by the grief. clark harrison, at nineteen a survivor, never to walk or have a child or be a senator or governor. herr wegner, who led his little troop, their standards high and sabers drawn, against a panzer corps, emerging from among the shades at dachau stacked like firewood for someone else to burn; and gerd radomski, listening to broadcasts of names, a yearlong babel of the missing, to find his wife and children. then they came home, near middle age at twenty-two, to find a new reunion of the church and state, cynical constantines who need no name, domestic tranquility beaten to a sword, sons wasted by another lie in asia, or strangeloves they had feared that august day; and they like runners, stung, behind a flag, running within a circle, bereft of joy.  hearing of the disaster at sedan and the retreat worse than the one from moscow, their son among the missing or the dead, pasteur and his wife mary hired a carriage and, traveling to the east where he might try his way to paris, stopping to ask each youth and comfort every orphan of the state’s irascibility, found him at last and, unsurprised, embraced and took him in. two wars later, the prussian, once again the son of mars, in paris, joseph meister— the first boy cured of rabies, now the keeper of pasteur’s mausoleum—when commanded to open it for them, though over seventy, lest he betray the master, took his life.  i like to think of pasteur in elysium beneath the sunny pine of ripe provence tenderly raising black sheep, butterflies, silkworms, and a new culture, for delight, teaching his daughter to use a microscope and musing through a wonder—sacred passion, practice and metaphysic all the same. and, each year, honor three births: valéry, humbling his pride by trying to write well, mozart, who lives still, keeping my attention repeatedly outside the reach of pride, and him whose mark i witness as a trust. others he saves but could not save himself— socrates, galen, hippocrates—the spirit fastened by love upon the human cross.  
NEW POEM
 others taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs always wrong to the light, so never seeing deeper down in the well than where the water gives me back in a shining surface picture me myself in the summer heaven godlike looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs. once, when trying with chin against a well-curb, i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture, through the picture, a something white, uncertain, something more of the depths—and then i lost it. water came to rebuke the too clear water. one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple shook whatever it was lay there at bottom, blurred it, blotted it out. what was that whiteness? truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something.

 because she broke your heart,shannon’s a badge— a seven-letter skidmark that scars up across your chest, a flare of indelible script. between death or glory, and mama, she rages, scales the trellis of your rib cage; her red hair swings down to bracket your ankles, whip up the braid of your backbone, cuff your wrists.  she keeps you sleepless with her afterimage,  and each pinned and martyred limb aches for more. her memory wraps you like a vise. how simple the pain that trails and graces the length of your body.  how it fans, blazes, writes itself over in the blood’s tightening sighs, bruises into wisdom you have no name for.

 of course there is a jackhammer. and a view, like hopper, but happier. of course there is the newspaper—the daily herald of our powerlessness. easy go, easy come:thwash, the next day another, an example of everything that gets done in the dark. like the initiative of the crocuses from a snow that was, as it works out, warming them. or in this case, the strange october weather warming them. there were the conclusions we jumped to. to which we jumped. there was pain, and then there was suffering. of course there was my ambition to offer you the world, but one that i have rearranged to make sense. here are all the sensations of being alive at the turn of the twenty-first century, here’s how they ring out against each other, here’s how one brings out the sense of another, here is the yellow next to the fathomless blue.

 today i left groceries by the playground on hudson and tried to haul, up toward my block, a cross section of a maple grown too large, chainsawed into manhole covers. alphonso, super for all buildings east of the projects, stopped sweeping. he leaned his bald broom against the stoop, nudged the wood with his toe. “nothing to do but roll it,” he said, hands deep in his pockets. i nodded, barely believing my luck in the midst of asphalt, transistor radios, and the wet smell of dogs as he squatted eye level with the log, heaved it against his shoulder like a man who bears a handmade cross for miles on his pentitent back. i saw a kind of glory in his eyes, he understood the heft of the trunk, nicks in the damp bark. i stood on the side and righted the thing and together we rolled this boulder of tree past the indian deli, the russian shoe repair, the caribbean bakery. “you can smell the forest,” he said, as we reached my stoop, wood in the crook of his neck, sawdust and humus and sweat. and we hoisted the thing, one step at a time, stopping only to breathe the scent of sap and after a good half hour it was filling the whole of my apartment— the shade, the damp smell, that enormous presence— light brown rings so perfect my whole life fell right down inside them, concentric circles, tree within tree, the single slab a world within itself— suddenly it was thirty-five years ago: i stood on the edge of a forest, someplace upstate, and looked up into the branches of my first true and majestic tree, in the first real forest—trees instead of buildings. oh the breadth of those limbs— after the taut geometry of elevator, fire escape, lobby, to see through branches to the sun—i believed the world was mine, there was sap in my veins, the tree was limitless, the scent of the tree, the bark and the branch and the six-year-old sightline, which goes on to the edge of the known world.  
NEW POEM
 [introduction] lo now! four other acts upon the stage, childhood, and youth, the manly, and old-age. the first: son unto phlegm, grand-child to water, unstable, supple, moist, and cold’s his nature. the second: frolic claims his pedigree; from blood and air, for hot and moist is he. the third of fire and choler is compos’d, vindicative, and quarrelsome dispos’d. the last, of earth and heavy melancholy, solid, hating all lightness, and all folly. childhood was cloth’d in white, and given to show, his spring was intermixed with some snow. upon his head a garland nature set: of daisy, primrose, and the violet. such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime, before the sun hath throughly warm’d the clime. his hobby striding, did not ride, but run, and in his hand an hour-glass new begun, in dangers every moment of a fall, and when ‘tis broke, then ends his life and all. but if he held till it have run its last, then may he live till threescore years or past. next, youth came up in gorgeous attire (as that fond age, doth most of all desire), his suit of crimson, and his scarf of green. in’s countenance, his pride quickly was seen. garland of roses, pinks, and gillyflowers seemed to grow on’s head (bedew’d with showers). his face as fresh, as is aurora fair, when blushing first, she ‘gins to red the air. no wooden horse, but one of metal try’d: he seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride. then prancing on the stage, about he wheels; but as he went, death waited at his heels. the next came up, in a more graver sort, as one that cared for a good report. his sword by’s side, and choler in his eyes, but neither us’d (as yet) for he was wise, of autumn fruits a basket on his arm, his golden rod in’s purse, which was his charm. and last of all, to act upon this stage, leaning upon his staff, comes up old age. under his arm a sheaf of wheat he bore, a harvest of the best: what needs he more? in’s other hand a glass, ev’n almost run, this writ about:this out, then i am done. his hoary hairs and grave aspect made way, and all gave ear to what he had to say. these being met, each in his equipage intend to speak, according to their age, but wise old-age did with all gravity to childish childhood give precedency, and to the rest, his reason mildly told: that he was young, before he grew so old. to do as he, the rest full soon assents, their method was that of the elements, that each should tell what of himself he knew, both good and bad, but yet no more then’s true. with heed now stood, three ages of frail man, to hear the child, who crying, thus began.  childhood ah me! conceiv’d in sin, and born in sorrow, a nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow, whose mean beginning, blushing can’t reveal, but night and darkness must with shame conceal. my mother’s breeding sickness, i will spare, her nine months’ weary burden not declare. to shew her bearing pangs, i should do wrong, to tell that pain, which can’t be told by tongue. with tears into this world i did arrive; my mother still did waste, as i did thrive, who yet with love and all alacity, spending was willing to be spent for me. with wayward cries, i did disturb her rest, who sought still to appease me with her breast; with weary arms, she danc’d, and by,by, sung, when wretched i (ungrate) had done the wrong. when infancy was past, my childishness did act all folly that it could express. my silliness did only take delight, in that which riper age did scorn and slight, in rattles, bables, and such toyish stuff. my then ambitious thoughts were low enough. my high-born soul so straitly was confin’d that its own worth it did not know nor mind. this little house of flesh did spacious count, through ignorance, all troubles did surmount, yet this advantage had mine ignorance, freedom from envy and from arrogance. how to be rich, or great, i did not cark, a baron or a duke ne’r made my mark, nor studious was, kings favours how to buy, with costly presents, or base flattery; no office coveted, wherein i might make strong my self and turn aside weak right. no malice bare to this or that great peer, nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear. i gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life. i’d nought to do, ‘twixt prince, and peoples’ strife. no statist i: nor marti’list i’ th’ field. where e’re i went, mine innocence was shield. my quarrels, not for diadems, did rise, but for an apple, plumb, or some such prize. my strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars. my little wrath did cease soon as my wars. my duel was no challenge, nor did seek. my foe should weltering, with his bowels reek. i had no suits at law, neighbours to vex, nor evidence for land did me perplex. i fear’d no storms, nor all the winds that blows. i had no ships at sea, no fraughts to loose. i fear’d no drought, nor wet; i had no crop, nor yet on future things did place my hope. this was mine innocence, but oh the seeds lay raked up of all the cursed weeds, which sprouted forth in my insuing age, as he can tell, that next comes on the stage. but yet me let me relate, before i go, the sins and dangers i am subject to: from birth stained, with adam’s sinful fact, from thence i ‘gan to sin, as soon as act; a perverse will, a love to what’s forbid; a serpent’s sting in pleasing face lay hid; a lying tongue as soon as it could speak and fifth commandment do daily break; oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry; then nought can please, and yet i know not why. as many was my sins, so dangers too, for sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe, and though i miss the tossings of the mind, yet griefs in my frail flesh i still do find. what gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain? what tortures i, in breeding teeth sustain? what crudities my cold stomach hath bred? whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued? what breaches, knocks, and falls i daily have? and some perhaps, i carry to my grave. sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall: strangely preserv’d, yet mind it not at all. at home, abroad, my danger’s manifold that wonder ‘tis, my glass till now doth hold. i’ve done: unto my elders i give way, for ‘tis but little that a child can say.  youth my goodly clothing and beauteous skin declare some greater riches are within, but what is best i‘ll first present to view, and then the worst, in a more ugly hue, for thus to do we on this stage assemble, then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble. mine education, and my learning‘s such, as might my self, and others, profit much: with nurture trained up in virtue‘s schools; of science, arts, and tongues, i know the rules; the manners of the court, i likewise know, nor ignorant what they in country do. the brave attempts of valiant knights i prize that dare climb battlements, rear‘d to the skies. the snorting horse, the trumpet, drum i like, the glist‘ring sword, and well advanced pike. i cannot lie in trench before a town, nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown. i scorn the heavy corslet, musket-proof; i fly to catch the bullet that‘s aloof. though thus in field, at home, to all most kind, so affable that i do suit each mind, i can insinuate into the breast and by my mirth can raise the heart deprest. sweet music rapteth my harmonious soul, and elevates my thoughts above the pole. my wit, my bounty, and my courtesy makes all to place their future hopes on me. this is my best, but youth (is known) alas, to be as wild as is the snuffing ass, as vain as froth, as vanity can be, that who would see vain man may look on me: my gifts abus‘d, my education lost, my woful parents‘ longing hopes all crost; my wit evaporates in merriment; my valour in some beastly quarrel‘s spent; martial deeds i love not, ‘cause they’re virtuous, but doing so, might seem magnanimous. my lust doth hurry me to all that’s ill, i know no law, nor reason, but my will; sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse or stab the man in’s own defence, that’s worse. sometimes i cheat (unkind) a female heir of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue until her friends, treasure, and honour’s gone. sometimes i sit carousing others’ health until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth. from pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows, for he that loveth wine wanteth no woes. days, nights, with ruffins, roarers, fiddlers spend, to all obscenity my ears i bend, all counsel hate which tends to make me wise, and dearest friends count for mine enemies. if any care i take, ‘tis to be fine, for sure my suit more than my virtues shine. if any time from company i spare, ‘tis spent in curling, frisling up my hair, some young adonais i do strive to be. sardana pallas now survives in me. cards, dice, and oaths, concomitant, i love; to masques, to plays, to taverns still i move; and in a word, if what i am you’d hear, seek out a british, bruitish cavalier. such wretch, such monster am i; but yet more i want a heart all this for to deplore. thus, thus alas! i have mispent my time, my youth, my best, my strength, my bud, and prime, remembring not the dreadful day of doom, nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come, though dangers do attend me every hour and ghastly death oft threats me with her power: sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken, sometimes by agues all my body shaken; sometimes by fevers, all my moisture drinking, my heart lies frying, and my eyes are sinking. sometimes the cough, stitch, painful pleurisy, with sad affrights of death, do menace me. sometimes the loathsome pox my face be-mars with ugly marks of his eternal scars. sometimes the frenzy strangely mads my brain that oft for it in bedlam i remain. too many’s my diseases to recite, that wonder ‘tis i yet behold the light, that yet my bed in darkness is not made, and i in black oblivion’s den long laid. of marrow full my bones, of milk my breasts, ceas’d by the gripes of serjeant death's arrests: thus i have said, and what i’ve said you see, childhood and youth is vain, yea vanity.  middle age childhood and youth forgot, sometimes i’ve seen, and now am grown more staid that have been green, what they have done, the same was done by me: as was their praise, or shame, so mine must be. now age is more, more good ye do expect; but more my age, the more is my defect. but what’s of worth, your eyes shall first behold, and then a world of dross among my gold. when my wild oats were sown, and ripe, and mown, i then receiv’d a harvest of mine own. my reason, then bad judge, how little hope such empty seed should yield a better crop. i then with both hands graspt the world together, thus out of one extreme into another, but yet laid hold on virtue seemingly: who climbs without hold, climbs dangerously. be my condition mean, i then take pains my family to keep, but not for gains. if rich, i’m urged then to gather more to bear me out i’ th’ world and feed the poor; if a father, then for children must provide, but if none, then for kindred near ally’d; if noble, then mine honour to maintain; if not, yet wealth, nobility can gain. for time, for place, likewise for each relation, i wanted not my ready allegation. yet all my powers for self-ends are not spent, for hundreds bless me for my bounty sent, whose loins i’ve cloth’d, and bellies i have fed, with mine own fleece, and with my household bread. yea, justice i have done, was i in place, to cheer the good and wicked to deface. the proud i crush’d, th’oppressed i set free, the liars curb’d but nourisht verity. was i a pastor, i my flock did feed and gently lead the lambs, as they had need. a captain i, with skill i train’d my band and shew’d them how in face of foes to stand. if a soldier, with speed i did obey as readily as could my leader say. was i a laborer, i wrought all day as cheerfully as ere i took my pay. thus hath mine age (in all) sometimes done well; sometimes mine age (in all) been worse than hell. in meanness, greatness, riches, poverty did toil, did broil; oppress’d, did steal and lie. was i as poor as poverty could be, then baseness was companion unto me. such scum as hedges and high-ways do yield, as neither sow, nor reap, nor plant, nor build. if to agriculture i was ordain’d, great labours, sorrows, crosses i sustain’d. the early cock did summon, but in vain, my wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain. for restless day and night, i’m robb’d of sleep by cankered care, who sentinel doth keep. my weary breast rest from his toil can find, but if i rest, the more distrest my mind. if happiness my sordidness hath found, ‘twas in the crop of my manured ground: my fatted ox, and my exuberous cow, my fleeced ewe, and ever farrowing sow. to greater things i never did aspire, my dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher. if to be rich, or great, it was my fate. how was i broil’d with envy, and with hate? greater than was the great’st was my desire, and greater still, did set my heart on fire. if honour was the point to which i steer’d, to run my hull upon disgrace i fear’d, but by ambitious sails i was so carried that over flats, and sands, and rocks i hurried, opprest, and sunk, and sack’d, all in my way that did oppose me to my longed bay. my thirst was higher than nobility and oft long’d sore to taste on royalty, whence poison, pistols, and dread instruments have been curst furtherers of mine intents. nor brothers, nephews, sons, nor sires i’ve spar’d. when to a monarchy my way they barr'’d, there set, i rid my self straight out of hand of such as might my son, or his withstand, then heapt up gold and riches as the clay, which others scatter like the dew in may. sometimes vain-glory is the only bait whereby my empty school is lur’d and caught. be i of worth, of learning, or of parts, i judge i should have room in all men’s hearts; and envy gnaws if any do surmount. i hate for to be had in small account. if bias like, i’m stript unto my skin; i glory in my wealth i have within. thus good, and bad, and what i am, you see, now in a word, what my diseases be: the vexing stone, in bladder and in reins, torments me with intolerable pains; the windy cholic oft my bowels rend, to break the darksome prison, where it’s penn’d; the knotty gout doth sadly torture me, and the restraining lame sciatica; the quinsy and the fevers often distaste me, and the consumption to the bones doth waste me, subject to all diseases, that’s the truth, though some more incident to age, or youth; and to conclude, i may not tedious be, man at his best estate is vanity.  old age what you have been, ev’n such have i before, and all you say, say i, and something more. babe's innocence, youth’s wildness i have seen, and in perplexed middle-age have been, sickness, dangers, and anxieties have past, and on this stage am come to act my last. i have been young, and strong, and wise as you but now,bis pueri senes is too true. in every age i’ve found much vanity. an end of all perfection now i see. it’s not my valour, honour, nor my gold, my ruin’d house, now falling can uphold; it’s not my learning, rhetoric, wit so large, now hath the power, death’s warfare, to discharge. it’s not my goodly house, nor bed of down, that can refresh, or ease, if conscience frown; nor from alliance now can i have hope, but what i have done well, that is my prop. he that in youth is godly, wise, and sage provides a staff for to support his age. great mutations, some joyful, and some sad, in this short pilgrimage i oft have had. sometimes the heavens with plenty smil’d on me, sometimes, again, rain’d all adversity; sometimes in honour, sometimes in disgrace, sometime an abject, then again in place: such private changes oft mine eyes have seen. in various times of state i’ve also been. i’ve seen a kingdom flourish like a tree when it was rul’d by that celestial she, and like a cedar others so surmount that but for shrubs they did themselves account. then saw i france, and holland sav’d,calais won, and philip and albertus half undone. i saw all peace at home, terror to foes, but ah, i saw at last those eyes to close, and then, me thought, the world at noon grew dark when it had lost that radiant sun-like spark. in midst of griefs, i saw some hopes revive (for ‘twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive); i saw hopes dash’t, our forwardness was shent, and silenc’d we, by act of parliament. i’ve seen from rome, an execrable thing, a plot to blow up nobles and their king. i’ve seen designs at ree and cades cross’t, and poor palatinate for every lost. i’ve seen a prince to live on others’ lands, a royal one, by alms from subjects’ hands. i’ve seen base men, advanc’d to great degree, and worthy ones, put to extremity, but not their prince’s love, nor state so high, could once reverse, their shameful destiny. i’ve seen one stabb’d, another lose his head, and others fly their country through their dread. i’ve seen, and so have ye, for ‘tis but late, the desolation of a goodly state. plotted and acted so that none can tell who gave the counsell, but the prince of hell. i’ve seen a land unmoulded with great pain, but yet may live to see’t made up again. i’ve seen it shaken, rent, and soak’d in blood, but out of troubles ye may see much good. these are no old wives’ tales, but this is truth. we old men love to tell, what’s done in youth. but i return from whence i stept awry; my memory is short and brain is dry. my almond-tree (gray hairs) doth flourish now, and back, once straight, begins apace to bow. my grinders now are few, my sight doth fail, my skin is wrinkled, and my cheeks are pale. no more rejoice, at music’s pleasant noise, but do awake at the cock’s clanging voice. i cannot scent savours of pleasant meat, nor sapors find in what i drink or eat. my hands and arms, once strong, have lost their might. i cannot labour, nor i cannot fight: my comely legs, as nimble as the roe, now stiff and numb, can hardly creep or go. my heart sometimes as fierce, as lion bold, now trembling, and fearful, sad, and cold. my golden bowl and silver cord, e’re long, shall both be broke, by wracking death so strong. i then shall go whence i shall come no more. sons, nephews, leave, my death for to deplore. in pleasures, and in labours, i have found that earth can give no consolation sound to great, to rich, to poor, to young, or old, to mean, to noble, fearful, or to bold. from king to beggar, all degrees shall find but vanity, vexation of the mind. yea, knowing much, the pleasant’st life of all hath yet amongst that sweet, some bitter gall. though reading others’ works doth much refresh, yet studying much brings weariness to th’ flesh. my studies, labours, readings all are done, and my last period can e’en elmost run. corruption, my father, i do call, mother, and sisters both; the worms that crawl in my dark house, such kindred i have store. there i shall rest till heavens shall be no more; and when this flesh shall rot and be consum’d, this body, by this soul, shall be assum’d; and i shall see with these same very eyes my strong redeemer coming in the skies. triumph i shall, o’re sin, o’re death, o’re hell, and in that hope, i bid you all farewell.

 1 i find a strange knowledge of wind, an open door in the mountain pass where everything intersects. believe me. this will not pass. this is a world where flags contain themselves, and are still, marked by their unfurled edges. lean stuff sways on the boughs of pitch pine: silver, almost tinsel, all light gone blue and sprouting orange oils in a last bouquet.  2 these were the nest builders; i caught one last morning, i sang so it fell down, stupid, from the trees. they’re so incorrect in their dead skin. witness their twig feet, the mistake of their hands. they will follow you. they yearn pebbles for their gullets to grind their own seed. they swallow so selflessly and die like patriots.  3 last christmas, a family of five woke from their dreaming and dreamed themselves over: the baby in its pink pajamas, the boy in the red flannel bathrobe he grabbed from the door, a mother, a father, and a sister in curlers; all died.  a wood frame house, a cannister of oil, a match—watch as it unsettles. they were so cold; umber.  4 i am away from the knowledge of animal mystics, brujas and sorcerers or the nudging chants of a tlingit kachina. i am frightened by regions with wills of their own, but when my people die in the snow i wonder did the depths billow up to reach them?

 act 1 , scene 1 : do you know what it means for our survival?  fog spun into silk on the knee of the comptroller, propelled toward the crest of ontario, the old, faded star, steambreath onto the windshield.  to orient in the finest sense of cackles, mute chrysanthemums, funneling inordinate nakedness, absorbed, absorbed, immediately absorbed.  ohhhhhhhhhhhh, we stay limber, each line choreographed from a tremendous mouthful of swamp, skunk cabbage brining at the jowls, acquiesced to pestilence, and exaggerated diffidence.  do you know what it is to clamp your shell an extra foot into the silt riverbank, kissing the soles of passersby, silky grains churning the earth over?  makeshift ceremonial dances, fine textiles culled from thrift store bins display brightly-colored throats who feed stacks of cash killed on recycled names. there is a golden tapestry on the berry-stained bottom of wealth woman’s basket of abalone. beneath it are the exhausted faces of her babies grown old in the length of the inhale, and a facsimile remains from all the cycles spilled over, since nature cannot acid wash, since frizz canvassing the ozone always carries over.  geometry for days, countless days, spin-cycled through a craftsman’s circumpolar hands. there’s always another grotto or chamber where things dwell, they say. wandering skitterers we are, the northern lights vacuum pried-open skulls. we cover ourselves with hides and entrails, overripe elderberries, looking to steal a moment of letup from the glare. the limbs of the old ones shunt aside bare toes, stripped solid and indifferent as a bear’s den or an ant’s apartment.  don’t be so much in charge, the frogs say, of coalescing wolverine trails huddled in 60-million-year pellet tracks when the wetlands dried out.  the way soaked, green corpuscles rasp each other’s mouths and hands braiding the woof of god’s mind, that’s how it is, says the giant rat’s captive wife.  even if you can only faintly hear the eighth narrative told in the corner of the babbling wooden-slat house, that is enough leftover hooligan grease for the gods with killer whale ganglia.  knuckles rasp proscenium floorboards, splattering herring peck at scops owl’s waist, spruce branch lowered, scrapes conglomerate bedrock.  mother-in-law’s atonic hands lunge for stewed milt.  one can conclude it’s a virus to plant burdensome layers of topographic crust on self-renewing limbs, like there was more to it than rustling fingers at the end of the line.  all components must be in order, or it’s an ulcer here, a bladder infection there, a baked-out parking lot, fizzing in trampled-over, chastened hairlines.  hold, hold, hold, hold in your palms the steller’s jay that beats its wings on glaciers lying high and straight over rivers slicing into cool nettles.  sea lions suck up a quick breath, dive and waft on the outskirts of ballerinas who gyrate in like-mind to classics bubbling up from sedna’s citadels.  i’m here to show you what you can do with this sandbar dialect, says the humpback whale and the goatsbeard moss, and the ore of iron oxide in the shoreline cliff. you must trust, she says, your swimming blood, joints lumbering in shadows, the dolphin clicking out to you, far above ground. and we should feed just as much as eat, says the heart your body formed around.

 in green water i saw your eye and in it i saw that arabian palace filled with birds and broken glass. i copy an address into my right hand and fill myself with memories of psalms. a green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave that rises like the wailing wall.  my sun-baked body at the edge, wind in my lungs, its whistle, my torn world, my grief, my soggy passport, my shell with no pearl, you lift them, delicate cloud, into a liquid world.  last night i dreamed of my father's flabby body and of my blue resolve to run away, to find a way, i dreamed of your eye and for an instant i found the vertex of the road, the imaginary line that falls across the earth: that meridian where the sun on a tiger's back meets the shade at its belly.  waking up, we are swallowed by wakefulness. the house swallows us in its terrible thirst. the routine of taking our children to school swallows us and so does the if only i could.  there was something to that dream. you know it. a direction. a way. a forest as green as you and your roots.  give me your premonitions, give me your book, give me your prodigious memory, give me the blue gaze from your dark eye, give me the devotion of your sleeping birds.  sometimes the way is a fire through which the circus tiger leaps, a perfect circle returning to me with its stripes intact and with the endless continuity of this ineluctably feral world.

 twenty-eight shotgun pellets crater my thighs, belly and groin. i gently thumb each burnt bead, fingering scabbed stubs with ointment.  could have neutered me, made extinct the volatile, romantic man i am. “he’s dead,” doctor at emergency room could’ve easily told my wife that night. instead, “soak him in a bath twice a day. apply this ointment to the sores. here’s a month’s supply of pain killers.” i remember the deep guttural groan i gave, when the doctor pressed my groin. assured i could still make love, morphine drowsed me and in a dull stupor i don’t remember police visiting my bed, or laughing so hard, they scowled for a serious answer. i howled a u.f.o. shot me along the río grande, and they cursed and left.  in the summer of ’88 i’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf. still smelling of milk udders, i tied it to the truck rack and drove off. its hooves teethed at pink roots ’til the whole lush field went bare dirt. a magnificent bull. glowing wheel of heart breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn. he wrangled his black brawn like a battleshield to challenge the sun, reared thick neck down and sideways, lunged at me with dart and snort, hoof-stamped and nostrilled dirt, ’til i growled him back whipping air with a limber willow branch, poured grain in trough and spread alfalfa. i respected his horns and he the whistling menace of willow.  one afternoon my cousin patricio helped me band the bull’s scrotum, usurp swollen sap in his testicle sack. it withered to a pink wattle and seeded the garden to drive cornstalks to bear hardy, golden horns.  thereafter, he grazed the fenceline, with the tempered lust and peaceful grace of a celibate priest. his bearing now arranged itself elegant as a wild flower sprung over night. ______________  perfecto shot it. rasping on a black rope of blood round its neck, it staggered, bouldering convulsions. blood exploding in bright lash of earthquaked air, it stumble-butted stock trailer fender— second and third shots glowed its death.  a quivering shadow of life-flame darkened the air and it sputtered a last drop of blood. i drank long swigs of whiskey and, thinking it was dead, turned to walk away, then it gave a tremendous groan, tremendous groan, a birth-letting groan . . . a moon groan . . . blood spurted out, thick, thick, thick alleys of dead star blood  and i turned and said aloud to myself, “that’s the moon’s voice! that’s the moon’s voice!”  and the white moon was in the sky, and i looked at the moon for a long time. ______________  i sat on the ground and gulped whiskey, drank the steer’s death still warm in my throat. a beautiful animal! i allowed to be butchered. when it trounced and galloped in the field, its body was a dark, windy cliff edge, and its eyes were doorways of a dream— now it bled a charred scroll of ancient chant in gravel, i would never know, and its blackened logs of blood smoldered dying vowels, i would never hear. my heart’s creak-n-tremble rage milled the steer’s death to red grist, i grieved, i wept drunkenly that no one cared, that humankind betrayed him, that we were all cowards. ______________  perfecto, valasquez and the butcher tried to stop me from driving, but now was the time to settle a bad feud with another friend. redeem the bull’s blood with ours. i drove to felipe’s house, anger knotted in me tight as the rope tied to the stock trailer steer strained against. i pulled, but could not free myself. (i had a dream night before— i crossed black-iron footbridge, partially collapsed by sea storm. left-hand railing swept out to sea, i gripped bolt-studded right-hand railing, finger-clutched wire netting sides, carefully descended waist-high water. waded through slowly and ascended other side— but had lost my sunglasses and wallet, went back, groped bottom, found them and ascended again.)  had to cross that bridge again. full of significance . . . tonight, deepest part of flooded bridge was danger . . . drowning . . . represented years of my life collapsed and destroyed, water the cleansing element, my ascent from had healed, onto firm ground, but i went back, to re-live destruction… “felipe!” i yelled, porch light flicked on, illuminating the yard. “came to fight,” i said, “take off your glasses.”  bug-eyes glazed bewildered, then gray slits of lips snarled, “you motherless dog!” he withdrew in darkness a moment, reappeared on porch, serrated saw of his voice cut the chill dark, “¡hijo de su pinche madre! ¡mátalo!   ¡¡mátalo!!”  first shot framed darkness round me with a spillway of bright light, eruption of sound, and second shot roared a spray of brilliance and the third gave an expanded halo-flash. my legs woozed, and then i buckled to the ground. (i thought, holy shit, what ever happened to the old yard-style fight between estranged friends!)  i groaned with the steer, and crawled my dead legs to the truck, lunged on elbows into the cab, hand lifting the dead stone beneath my waist to clutch and brake.  following morning calls came, “tell us who did it gato!” “our rifles are loaded!” i said, “leave it alone. what would you do if a drunk man came into your yard, threatened to beat you?” i wanted peace, wanted to diffuse the immovable core of vengeance in my heart, i had carried since a child, dismantle the bloody wheel of violence i had ridden since a child.  during my week in bed, pellets pollinated me with a forgotten peace, and between waking thoughts of anger and vengeance, sleep was a small meadow of light, a clearing i walked into and rested. fragrance of peace filled me as fragrance of flowers and dirt permeate hands that work in the garden all day.  curandero came to visit, and said, “the bull in ancient times was the symbol of females. did you know that? killing the bull, is killing the intuitive part of yourself, the feminine part. did you realize, when jesus was raising lazarus, he groaned in his spirit and that bull groaned, and when you killed the bull, it was raising you. the dying bull gave birth to you and now you are either blessed or cursed. the flood of that bull’s blood, is either going to drown you or liberate you, but it will not be wasted.”

 a wanderer is man from his birth. he was born in a ship on the breast of the river of time; brimming with wonder and joy he spreads out his arms to the light, rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.  as what he sees is, so have his thoughts been. whether he wakes, where the snowy mountainous pass, echoing the screams of the eagles, hems in its gorges the bed of the new-born clear-flowing stream; whether he first sees light where the river in gleaming rings sluggishly winds through the plain; whether in sound of the swallowing sea— as is the world on the banks, so is the mind of the man.  vainly does each, as he glides, fable and dream of the lands which the river of time had left ere he woke on its breast, or shall reach when his eyes have been closed. only the tract where he sails he wots of; only the thoughts, raised by the objects he passes, are his.  who can see the green earth any more as she was by the sources of time? who imagines her fields as they lay in the sunshine, unworn by the plough? who thinks as they thought, the tribes who then roam'd on her breast, her vigorous, primitive sons?  what girl now reads in her bosom as clear as rebekah read, when she sate at eve by the palm-shaded well? who guards in her breast as deep, as pellucid a spring of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?  what bard, at the height of his vision, can deem of god, of the world, of the soul, with a plainness as near, as flashing as moses felt when he lay in the night by his flock on the starlit arabian waste? can rise and obey the beck of the spirit like him?  this tract which the river of time now flows through with us, is the plain. gone is the calm of its earlier shore. border'd by cities and hoarse with a thousand cries is its stream. and we on its breast, our minds are confused as the cries which we hear, changing and shot as the sights which we see.  and we say that repose has fled for ever the course of the river of time. that cities will crowd to its edge in a blacker, incessanter line; that the din will be more on its banks, denser the trade on its stream, flatter the plain where it flows, fiercer the sun overhead. that never will those on its breast see an ennobling sight, drink of the feeling of quiet again.  but what was before us we know not, and we know not what shall succeed.  haply, the river of time— as it grows, as the towns on its marge fling their wavering lights on a wider, statelier stream— may acquire, if not the calm of its early mountainous shore, yet a solemn peace of its own.  and the width of the waters, the hush of the grey expanse where he floats, freshening its current and spotted with foam as it draws to the ocean, may strike peace to the soul of the man on its breast— as the pale waste widens around him, as the banks fade dimmer away, as the stars come out, and the night-wind brings up the stream murmurs and scents of the infinite sea.

 for peter orr  when all the rooms of the house fill with smoke, it’s not enough to say an angel is sleeping on the chimney. 1. a night in the barn   the deer carcass hangs from a rafter. wrapped in blankets, a boy keeps watch from a pile of loose hay. then he sleeps  and dreams about a death that is coming: inside him, there are small bones scattered in a field among burdocks and dead grass. he will spend his life walking there, gathering the bones together.  pigeons rustle in the eaves. at his feet, the german shepherd snaps its jaws in its sleep.   2  a father and his four sons run down a slope toward a deer they just killed. the father and two sons carry rifles. they laugh, jostle, and chatter together. a gun goes off and the youngest brother falls to the ground. a boy with a rifle stands beside him, screaming.   3  i crouch in the corner of my room, staring into the glass well of my hands; far down i see him drowning in air.  outside, leaves shaped like mouths make a black pool under a tree. snails glide there, little death-swans.   4. smoke  something has covered the chimney and the whole house fills with smoke. i go outside and look up at the roof, but i can’t see anything. i go back inside. everyone weeps, walking from room to room. their eyes ache. this smoke turns people into shadows. even after it is gone and the tears are gone, we will smell it in pillows when we lie down to sleep.   5  he lives in a house of black glass. sometimes i visit him, and we talk. my father says he is dead, but what does that mean? last night i found a child sleeping on a nest of bones. he had a red, leaf-shaped scar on his cheek. i lifted him up and carried him with me, though i didn’t know where i was going.   6. the journey  each night, i knelt on a marble slab and scrubbed at the blood. i scrubbed for years and still it was there. but tonight the bones in my feet begin to burn. i stand up and start walking, and the slab appears under my feet with each step, a white road only as long as your body.   7. the distance  the winter i was eight, a horse slipped on the ice, breaking its leg. father took a rifle, a can of gasoline. i stood by the road at dusk and watched the carcass burning in the far pasture.  i was twelve when i killed him; i felt my own bones wrench from my body. now i am twenty-seven and walk beside this river, looking for them. they have become a bridge that arches toward the other shore.

 the great house birch with its girth he never quite could get his arms around, long felled, at last only its bark like a larva’s husk in grass leaning neck-high, hollow below mansards.  he does not live in the peeling mansion, but a more-than-ample keeper’s cottage beyond rolled lawns and relics of victorian elms where he muses in his study alcove. touches the ancient coins, silver or bronze, their gleam on the baize-topped writing table — proud athena helmeted; her owl agog beneath. eternity glimpsed in the boy ruler gordian’s profile, copper green. trees on guard in browed dignity now the seething barrack of bees. nearby a maple twisted by wind for decades spirals, a stair winding above the cone of shade. in his covert the son, reading herodotus, suetonius — staggering run of drachmas, staters, tetradrachms, glinting in rows.

 wedding night graciela bled lightly— but enough to stain his thighs— and left an alphabet of teeth marks on his arm. at this, he was happy. they drank mescal in bed like the rich and smoked cigarettes. she asleep and the bottle empty, he hid a few coins in her left shoe, earrings in the right. they worked long hours hoeing crooked rows of maize. evenings she wove rugs and embroidered curtains to market in taxco. in short they lived well. however in the seventh month with child, her belly rising like a portion of the sun, something knotted inside her. the ribs ached. a fever climbed. manuel summoned the partera and though she burned pepper, and tied belts around the stretched belly, the child did not ease out. days later she turned onto her belly and between her legs unraveled a spine of blood.

 i cut myself upon the thought of you and yet i come back to it again and again, a kind of fury makes me want to draw you out from the dimness of the present and set you sharply above me in a wheel of roses. then, going obviously to inhale their fragrance, i touch the blade of you and cling upon it, and only when the blood runs out across my fingers am i at all satisfied.

NEW POEM
 mildest of all the powers of earth: no lightnings for her—maniacal in the clouds. no need for signs with their skull and crossbones, chain-link gates: danger! keep out! high gravity! she’s friendlier. won’t nurse—unlike the magnetic powers—repugnance; would reconcile, draw close: her passion’s love.  no terrors lurking in her depths, like those bound in that buzzing strongbox of the atom, terrors that, lossened, turn the hills vesuvian, trace in cremation where the cities were.  no, she’s our quiet mother, sensible. but therefore down-to-earth, not suffering fools who play fast and loose among the mountains, who fly in her face, or, drunken, clown on cornices.  she taught our ways of walking. her affection adjusted the morning grass, the sands of summer until our soles fit snug in each, walk easy. holding her hand, we’re safe. should that hand fail, the atmosphere we breathe would turn hysterical, hiss with tornadoes, spinning us from earth into the cold unbreathable desolations.  yet there—in fields of space—is where she shines, ring-mistress of the circus of the stars, their prancing carousels, their ferris wheels lit brilliant in celebration. thanks to her all’s gala in the galaxy.  down here she walks us just right, not like the jokey moon burlesquing our human stride to kangaroo hops; not like vast planets, whose unbearable mass would crush us in a bear hug to their surface and into the surface, flattened. no: deals fairly. makes happy each with each: the willow bend just so, the acrobat land true, the keystone nestle in place for bridge and for cathedral. let us pick up—or mostly—what we need: rake, bucket, stone to build with, logs for warmth, the fallen fruit, the fallen child . . . ourselves.  instructs us too in honesty: our jointed limbs move awry and crisscross, gawky, thwart; she’s all directness and makes that a grace, all downright passion for the core of things, for rectitude, the very ground of being: those eyes are leveled where the heart is set.  see, on the tennis court this august day: how, beyond human error, she’s the one whose will the bright balls cherish and obey —as if in love. she’s tireless in her courtesies to even the klutz (knees, elbows all a-tangle), allowing his poky serve euclidean whimsies, the looniest lob its joy: serene parabolas.  
NEW POEM
 some say it’s in the reptilian dance of the purple-tongued sand goanna, for there the magnificent translation of tenacity into bone and grace occurs.  and some declare it to be an expansive desert—solid rust-orange rock like dusk captured on earth in stone— simply for the perfect contrast it provides to the blue-grey ridge of rain in the distant hills.  some claim the harmonics of shifting electron rings to be most rare and some the complex motion of seven sandpipers bisecting the arcs and pitches of come and retreat over the mounting hayfield.  others, for grandeur, choose the terror of lightning peals on prairies or the tall collapsing cathedrals of stormy seas, because there they feel dwarfed and appropriately helpless; others select the serenity of that ceiling/cellar of stars they see at night on placid lakes, because there they feel assured and universally magnanimous.  but it is the dark emptiness contained in every next moment that seems to me the most singularly glorious gift, that void which one is free to fill with processions of men bearing burning cedar knots or with parades of blue horses, belled and ribboned and stepping sideways, with tumbling white-faced mimes or companies of black-robed choristers; to fill simply with hammered silver teapots or kiln-dried crockery, tangerine and almond custards, polonaises, polkas, whittling sticks, wailing walls; that space large enough to hold all invented blasphemies and pieties, 10,000 definitions of god and more, never fully filled, never.

 beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed their snow-white blossoms on my head, with brightest sunshine round me spread of spring's unclouded weather, in this sequestered nook how sweet to sit upon my orchard-seat! and birds and flowers once more to greet, my last year's friends together.  one have i marked, the happiest guest in all this covert of the blest: hail to thee, far above the rest in joy of voice and pinion! thou, linnet! in thy green array, presiding spirit here to-day, dost lead the revels of the may; and this is thy dominion.  while birds, and butterflies, and flowers, make all one band of paramours, thou, ranging up and down the bowers, art sole in thy employment: a life, a presence like the air, scattering thy gladness without care, too blest with any one to pair; thyself thy own enjoyment.  amid yon tuft of hazel trees, that twinkle to the gusty breeze, behold him perched in ecstasies, yet seeming still to hover; there! where the flutter of his wings upon his back and body flings shadows and sunny glimmerings, that cover him all over.  my dazzled sight he oft deceives, a brother of the dancing leaves; then flits, and from the cottage-eaves pours forth his song in gushes; as if by that exulting strain he mocked and treated with disdain the voiceless form he chose to feign, while fluttering in the bushes.

 in june, amid the golden fields, i saw a groundhog lying dead. dead lay he; my senses shook, and mind outshot our naked frailty. there lowly in the vigorous summer his form began its senseless change, and made my senses waver dim seeing nature ferocious in him. inspecting close his maggots’ might and seething cauldron of his being, half with loathing, half with a strange love, i poked him with an angry stick. the fever arose, became a flame and vigour circumscribed the skies, immense energy in the sun, and through my frame a sunless trembling. my stick had done nor good nor harm. then stood i silent in the day watching the object, as before; and kept my reverence for knowledge trying for control, to be still, to quell the passion of the blood; until i had bent down on my knees praying for joy in the sight of decay. and so i left; and i returned in autumn strict of eye, to see the sap gone out of the groundhog, but the bony sodden hulk remained. but the year had lost its meaning, and in intellectual chains i lost both love and loathing, mured up in the wall of wisdom. another summer took the fields again massive and burning, full of life, but when i chanced upon the spot there was only a little hair left, and bones bleaching in the sunlight beautiful as architecture; i watched them like a geometer, and cut a walking stick from a birch. it has been three years, now. there is no sign of the groundhog. i stood there in the whirling summer, my hand capped a withered heart, and thought of china and of greece, of alexander in his tent; of montaigne in his tower, of saint theresa in her wild lament.

 what we built to hold us, the year's memory,  menus and daytrips, after a while   came loose. those nights  we balanced on each other's mistakes,   cradling our wine:  twigs those branches now.   who knew what lived there?  she she she called one bird.  what lived there knew its place.  another bird splits its nest wide,   hinges the gap with spider silk, learning  to give, to give, to give until breaking. only then—   either one gives until breaking or one does not.

 there are two memories of tides: one for the deep blackness that split away from the mother sea and one for sea that found itself in the daybreaks of rivers. yet it was all one sea tracked by comets and the elegant tern, seals in speckled pod-shaped skins, and whales, opening their small eyes when the hands of people drew fish out of the salt.  geologists tell us that the sea split millions of years ago before the yoemem, yoremem, kunkaak, o-otam curled their tongues around the names of themselves and raised the conch shell to their lips, so that the sound of nature became human, too:  kalifornia vaawe  then the sea was measured and divided into leagues. the spanish ships called it dangerous because the sea tore in two ways, tide and rivers, so they contained it in maps written on dead animal skins with ink made from dried octopus blood  mar de la kalifornia golfo de california

 come see the woodpile behind the cannery. come through the wall to where the wood was chopped and the difficult wood was hewed. there is a short history of commotion here, where a sudden bonfire spat its surprise at the sky—  a hundred feet or more the shavings swept through disturbed air, and made their own music, the music hands make, such a yellow crackle and such a thrashing  in the morning. come wait for the heavy trucks to arrive, the men in dusters cutting the twine, loading the long ghostly planks like ballast into iron barges.  this will be packing for a transatlantic box, or paper for essays on schadenfreude, or timber for dollhouse dressers, or a twenty baht note for the thai rubber trade. these matchsticks  will burn whenever you strike them, and this, hack at it however you like, is nothing more than deadwood for the fire. come see—now even the men are doing only what they were made to do.

 “in warm sunlight jade engenders smoke”; poetry, like indigo mountain, keeps its distance;  the light plays words and figures, stone’s edge edged with air, green haze growing.  amused by butterflies, chuang tsu dreaming, the emperor’s heart in spring, thoroughly transformed.  still, in pieces, the words rest so much apart. risking my life i lean on dangerous railings.   when the dream wakes to its own particulars, the strands scattered, loose hair on muslin,  broken characters the reeds make, unmake— vague    no reason bright    again    dark—

 morning   reading the bones, wetting a fingertip to trace archaic characters, i feel a breeze of silence flow up past my wrist, icy. can i speak here? the bones say i must. as the first light strikes across the lake, magpies scream, and the cast bones say the work must come true, it’s been true all along, we are what we do out on our digs. dictor and looker, all eyes, with spade and a jeweler’s loupe i sift mud &amp; dust for bone, for shellcast. spy, archeologist of freshness, i expect sight-made-sound to reveal fear cold at the throat of change, and loosen its grip so that mind, riding the bloodwarm stream, wells up as the speech that bears it and is telling.   evening   magpies scream. though the tongues of birds say now and warn forward, free of a live past, we seek back and forth for change, the ghostly sparkling of our watertable under everywhere. if i don’t speak to tap &amp; ease it out, i go dry &amp; dumb &amp; will die wicked. on the lake of the poets a stone lamp flickers. it casts eight moons dancing, casting doubt on the moon that rides above the winter air. ice thaws in a poet’s throat; the springing truth is fresh. it wakes taste. the taste lasts. language floods the mud; mind makes a cast of words; it precipitates, mercurial, like t’ang discourse riding the tidal constant of its source.

 off what thornbjörg calls the stern, or what i refer to as where you look upon the place you cannot return, one broke on through.  with little purpose but to tease, eye our sound ship, or take leave of the dog whistle our prop pitches ineptly into the eerie.  suturing the path to where it was bound, it hung split seconds in a realm unsoundable by its sonar. if only we could enter our dreams thus.  the cruise ship’s marriage counselor spoke to me in norwegian, and i agreed, knowing there was only so much she could have said  as it took the sun—and unlike beach stones once you get them home, kept its sodden hue going black into sea.

 what words or harder gift does the light require of me carving from the dark this difficult tree?  what place or farther peace do i almost see emerging from the night and heart of me?  the sky whitens, goes on and on. fields wrinkle into rows of cotton, go on and on. night like a fling of crows disperses and is gone.  what song, what home, what calm or one clarity can i not quite come to, never quite see: this field, this sky, this tree.

 tricky work sometimes not to smell yourself, ferment being constant—constant as carnival sweat (a non-stock phrase i palmed from a girl from canada, a land where i once saw this graffiti: life is great).  and i have tasted myself, especially when i spilled sinigang all down my arm in a pinoy workers' caff in little manila. i drank sinigang (is soup drunk?) in big manila too, with all its dead skyscrapers.  seen myself? in looking glasses or, looking down, stocky as a shift working cop, maybe a mexican cop full of beans (frijoles, i mean, not vim), paunch full of sopa de vigilia, pulling over a sozzled bus driver.  heard myself speak fluently in my own language, have heard myself too described as hard work (as hard to get through as scotch broth), though once someone rather bladdered told me i was magnetic.  and i may as well admit that i have touched myself (who hasn't?). in a forest, on a train, in new york and paris with unparalleled handiwork, sinning as i go, merry as an office boy spooning onion soup.

 my mare, when she was in heat, would travel the fenceline for hours, wearing the impatience in her feet into the ground.  not a stallion for miles, i’d assure her, give it up.  she’d widen her nostrils, sieve the wind for news, be moving again, her underbelly darkening with sweat, then stop at the gate a moment, wait to see what i might do. oh, i knew how it was for her, easily recognized myself in that wide lust: came to stand in the pasture just to see it played. offered a hand, a bucket of grain— a minute’s distraction from passion the most i gave.  then she’d return to what burned her: the fence, the fence, so hoping i might see, might let her free. i’d envy her then, to be so restlessly sure of heat, and need, and what it takes to feed the wanting that we are—  only a gap to open the width of a mare, the rest would take care of itself. surely, surely i knew that, who had the power of bucket and bridle— she would beseech me, sidle up, be gone, as life is short. but desire, desire is long.

 simone weil, 1909-1943 only the stones at first seem to have a part in this, and the little height of the grass as it gains a fraction-inch  by gripping the shallow soil with all the shocking might of hunger and of thirst, as if the soil itself  were all that's left on earth. i think the grass alone can hold within its grasp what matters to it most,  and still it looks bereft, and famished as the stones. i watch a stream of moths proceeding on their ways,  they carve out tortuous paths as if they were intent on entering unseen and ever-smaller doors.  so four years into the war, and cut off from the ones whose circumstance you felt and suffering as yours,  you carved yourself a path through ever-narrowing doors of hunger and of thirst, and entered them day by day,  refusing all at first but that ration of food your people could obtain behind the lines in france,  and then refusing that, from summer into fall you cut your ration back to send your part to them,  your part diminishing to rations cut in half and cut in half again, and then nothing at all  but water at the last sipped for the nurse's sake, you finally lacked the strength even to lift your hands:  father, i cannot stand to think of them and eat. send it to them, it is theirs. send this food for them,  for my people still in france. and turned your face away, as famished as the grass. only the stones at first  seem to have a part in this, and the little height of the grass as it gains a fraction-inch. but hidden in the grass  as if the grass itself were giving out a cry, i overhear the finch begin her native rhyme  and toil to paraphrase her version of your words. it seems she tries and tries until the words come clear,  it is theirs, she seems to say, or that is what i hear, and again: it is theirs, it is theirs. and the plover joins in praise  with her fluttering, murmured prayers: send it to them, it is theirs. and the blackbirds breaking wide take it up in their dialects  to sing you in their way, i swear i can hear the words, send it to them, they say, send it to them, it is theirs,  then all the birds of the air give thanks above your grave, as if they were your cause and those you meant to save,  as if the birds were there in attendance at the end, and, seeing the sacrifice had borne your body up,  so wasted as it was, to your chair in paradise, and saw, before they fled, your first breathtaking act  before the heavenly feast, the bread set at your place: to refuse to eat till none on earth has less than you,  though god in pity take your hands and lift them toward his table for your sake. father, they have no food,  send it to them, it is theirs. and the birds returning here give tongue to what they've heard, they tell the grass and stones  and the stream of moths who carve their tortuous paths in the air. but how in giving thanks can we calculate the worth  of one who chose to starve? you held within your grasp our hunger and our thirst. and the little height of the grass  as it gains a fraction-inch seems to have a part in this. it grips with a shocking might what matters to the last,  as if the soil itself were all that's left on earth, and all the earth were held within its famished grasp.

NEW POEM
 i'm herdsman of a flock. the sheep are my thoughts and my thoughts are all sensations. i think with my eyes and my ears and my hands and feet and nostrils and mouth.  to think a flower is to see and smell it. to eat a fruit is to sense its savor.  and that is why, when i feel sad, in a day of heat, because of so much joy and lay me down in the grass to rest and close my sun-warmed eyes, i feel my whole body relaxed in reality and know the whole truth and am happy.  
NEW POEM
 all winter she’s been growing more powerful. radiant, says the man at the bar. voluptuous, says the docent. nervy, says god. all winter her soul has been juddering. it feels like drinking gold flakes! the word sleeps inside the stone. the wind tongues the underside of the lake. inside the rifle scope of time, god teaches her grounding techniques through his emissary, a certified therapist. beetles bore their dirty traffic into pine trees. god says, you cling to deixis like a life raft.here, you say.now, you say.all winter, you say, like it means something, days crossed off your compulsive calendar, wind tied to your wrist like a pet. this dumb hunger for fixity! i made your cells to shed, says god. see them everywhere, everywhere. she bites her lip till it bleeds. who wouldn’t immanentize the eschaton, if they could, build heaven on earth in the backyard? she wouldn’t, is who. day a slit-throated ewe. she wears a prayer around her neck in another language, no clue what it says. who will translate the prayer? listen: she loved a happy libertine and thought that was heaven. to ground herself she strips berries from the juniper bushes. well, says god, alexander the great dyed his hair saffron. we are all made fools in this world.

NEW POEM
 thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay? repair me now, for now mine end doth haste, i run to death, and death meets me as fast, and all my pleasures are like yesterday; i dare not move my dim eyes any way, despair behind, and death before doth cast such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste by sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh. only thou art above, and when towards thee by thy leave i can look, i rise again; but our old subtle foe so tempteth me, that not one hour i can myself sustain; thy grace may wing me to prevent his art, and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.  
NEW POEM
 your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,— the finger-points look through like rosy blooms: your eyes smile peace. the pasture gleams and glooms 'neath billowing skies that scatter and amass. all round our nest, far as the eye can pass, are golden kingcup fields with silver edge where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge. 'tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.  deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:— so this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above. oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower, this close-companioned inarticulate hour when twofold silence was the song of love.  
NEW POEM
 not in thy body is thy life at all but in this lady's lips and hands and eyes; through these she yields thee life that vivifies what else were sorrow's servant and death's thrall. look on thyself without her, and recall the waste remembrance and forlorn surmise that liv'd but in a dead-drawn breath of sighs o'er vanish'd hours and hours eventual.  even so much life hath the poor tress of hair which, stor'd apart, is all love hath to show for heart-beats and for fire-heats long ago; even so much life endures unknown, even where, 'mid change the changeless night environeth, lies all that golden hair undimm'd in death.

 think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt die outstretch'd in the sun's warmth upon the shore, thou say'st: "man's measur'd path is all gone o'er: up all his years, steeply, with strain and sigh, man clomb until he touch'd the truth; and i, even i, am he whom it was destin'd for." how should this be? art thou then so much more than they who sow'd, that thou shouldst reap thereby?  nay, come up hither. from this wave-wash'd mound unto the furthest flood-brim look with me; then reach on with thy thought till it be drown'd. miles and miles distant though the last line be, and though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond,— still, leagues beyond those leagues, there is more sea.

 such as there was in the littleness of that dawn could not be this. not, certainly, the hove of an invasion fleet from angleterre, flotilla wrought of shipwright, chandler, armorer as if ice age breeding stocks were on the move.  the planners had their weather oracles, haruspices their entrails. all divined the red planet aligned, full-moon visibility, high tides to clear the beachhead obstacles — but iffy weather.

 a personal lens: glass bending rays that gave one that day’s news saying each and every day,  just remember you are standing on a planet that’s evolving. how beautiful, she thought, what distance does  for water, the view from above or afar. in last night’s dream, they were back again at the beginning. she was a child  and he was a child. a plane lit down and left her there. cold whitening the white sky whiter.  then a scalpel cut her open for all the world to be a sea.  
NEW POEM
 at neck, at shoulder, that  stokes a man as he grows  older. nothing rages, nothing  fumes. no one races through  the rooms, alarmed. how  casually he's armed. how  gradually arises what surprises  in his mirrors. unawares, as  fall runs colder, pulls he only  slightly tighter his good wool  sweater, thinner than ever now  at elbow, at shoulder.

 if i eat a diet of rain and nuts, walk to the p.o. in a loincloth, file for divorce from the world of matter, say not-it! to the sea oats,not-it! to the sky above the disheveled palms,not-it! to the white or green oyster boats and the men on the bridge with their fishing rods that resemble so many giant whiskers, if i repeat this is not it, this is not why i'm waiting here, will i fill the universe with all that is not-it and allow myself to grow very still in the center of this fishing town in winter? will i look out past the cat sleeping in the windowsill and say not-it! garbage can, not-it! long's video store, until i happen upon what is not not-it? will i wake up and behold! the "actual," the "real," the "awe-thentic," the is? instead i walk down the island quicky, take a pound of bait shrimp in an ice-filled baggie, then walk to the beach to catch my dinner. now waiting is the work i'm waiting for. now the sand crane dive-bombs the surf of his own enlightenment because everything is bait and lust and hard-up for supper. i came out here to pare things down, wanted to be wind, simple as sand, to hear each note in the infinite orchestra of waves fizzling out beneath the rotting dock at five o'clock in the afternoon when the voice that i call i is a one-man boat slapping toward the shore of a waning illusion. hello, waves of salty and epiphanic distance. good day, bird who will eventually go blind from slamming headfirst into the water. what do you say fat flounder out there deep in your need, looking like sand speckled with shells, lying so still you're hardly there, lungs lifting with such small air, flesh both succulent and flakey when baked with white wine, lemon and salt, your eyes rolling toward their one want when the line jerks, and the reel clicks, and the rod bends, and you give up the ocean floor for a mouthful of land.

 from sonnets, third series  v  how well do i recall that walk in state across the common, by the paths we knew: myself in silver badge and riband blue, my little sister with her book and slate; the elm tree by the pond, the fence of wood, the burial place that at the corner stood where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate, the stones that grudg’d us way, the graveside weed, the ominous wind that turned us half about. smit the flying drops, at what a speed across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven we hurried homeward when the day was late and heard, with awe that left no place for doubt, god’s anger mutter in the darkened heaven.  
NEW POEM
 1 is that an attitude for a flower, to stand like a club at the walk; poor slain boy, is that a way to show gratitude to the gods? white with colored hearts, the tall flowers sway around you, all the other boys, in the cold spring, as the violets open.  2 there were no flowers in antiquity but boys’ bodies, pale, perfectly imagined. so the gods sank to human shape with longing. in the field, in the willow grove, apollo sent the courtiers away.  3 and from the blood of the wound a flower sprang, lilylike, more brilliant than the purples of tyre. then the god wept: his vital grief flooded the earth.  4 beauty dies: that is the source of creation. outside the ring of trees the courtiers could hear the dove’s call transmit its uniform, its inborn sorrow— they stood listening, among the rustling willows. was this the god’s lament? they listened carefully. and for a short time all sound was sad.  5 there is no other immortality: in the cold spring, the purple violets open. and yet, the heart is black, there is its violence frankly exposed. or is it not the heart at the center but some other word? and now someone is bending over them, meaning to gather them—  6 they could not wait in exile forever. through the glittering grove the courtiers ran calling the name of their companion over the birds’ noise, over the willows’ aimless sadness. well into the night they wept, their clear tears altering no earthly color.  
NEW POEM
 from the forests and highlands we come, we come; from the river-girt islands, where loud waves are dumb listening to my sweet pipings. the wind in the reeds and the rushes, the bees on the bells of thyme, the birds on the myrtle bushes, the cicale above in the lime, and the lizards below in the grass, were as silent as ever old tmolus was, listening to my sweet pipings.  liquid peneus was flowing, and all dark tempe lay in pelion's shadow, outgrowing the light of the dying day, speeded by my sweet pipings. the sileni, and sylvans, and fauns, and the nymphs of the woods and the waves, to the edge of the moist river-lawns, and the brink of the dewy caves, and all that did then attend and follow, were silent with love, as you now, apollo, with envy of my sweet pipings.  i sang of the dancing stars, i sang of the daedal earth, and of heaven, and the giant wars, and love, and death, and birth— and then i chang'd my pipings, singing how down the vale of maenalus i pursu'd a maiden and clasp'd a reed. gods and men, we are all deluded thus! it breaks in our bosom and then we bleed. all wept, as i think both ye now would, if envy or age had not frozen your blood, at the sorrow of my sweet pipings.

 at the london zoo a toddler falls over the rail of the primate world only if you close your eyes  and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle her long dark arm around him only this one time  while the others stay away. the zookeeper says she lost a baby earlier this year only just barely  and they’ve been waiting months for her tits to dry. the boy’s mother watches from above  only when i say so the thirty minutes it takes the right person to lower the right ladder down  only as a last resort. in the interim a newscaster whose station carries it live only if you promise  not to let go  
NEW POEM
 i am a parcel of vain strivings tied by a chance bond together, dangling this way and that, their links were made so loose and wide, methinks, for milder weather.  a bunch of violets without their roots, and sorrel intermixed, encircled by a wisp of straw once coiled about their shoots, the law by which i'm fixed.  a nosegay which time clutched from out those fair elysian fields, with weeds and broken stems, in haste, doth make the rabble rout that waste the day he yields.  and here i bloom for a short hour unseen, drinking my juices up, with no root in the land to keep my branches green, but stand in a bare cup.  some tender buds were left upon my stem in mimicry of life, but ah! the children will not know, till time has withered them, the woe with which they're rife.  but now i see i was not plucked for naught, and after in life's vase of glass set while i might survive, but by a kind hand brought alive to a strange place.  that stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours, and by another year, such as god knows, with freer air, more fruits and fairer flowers will bear, while i droop here.  
NEW POEM
 i had just hung up from talking to you and we had been so immersed in the difficulty you were facing, and forgive me, i was thinking that as long as we kept talking, you in your car in the parking lot of the boys’ school as the afternoon deepened into early evening, and me in the study, all the books around that had been sources of beauty to us, as long as we stayed in the conversation padded with history like the floor of the pine forest, as long as i thought out loud, made a joke at my own expense, you would be harbored in that exchange, but the boys were leaving the track and after we hung up i looked out the window to see the top of the bare january trees spotlit to silvery red, massive but made from the thinnest twigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbs they were waving and shining in a light like no other and left only to them.  
NEW POEM
 i hid my love when young till i couldn't bear the buzzing of a fly; i hid my love to my despite till i could not bear to look at light: i dare not gaze upon her face but left her memory in each place; where'er i saw a wild flower lie i kissed and bade my love good-bye.  i met her in the greenest dells, where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells; the lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye, the bee kissed and went singing by, a sunbeam found a passage there, a gold chain round her neck so fair; as secret as the wild bee's song she lay there all the summer long.  i hid my love in field and town till e'en the breeze would knock me down; the bees seemed singing ballads o'er, the fly's bass turned a lion's roar; and even silence found a tongue, to haunt me all the summer long; the riddle nature could not prove was nothing else but secret love.  
NEW POEM
 i tell you that i see her still at the dark entrance of the hall. one gas lamp burning near her shoulder shone also from her other side where hung the long inaccurate glass whose pictures were as troubled water. an immense shadow had its hand between us on the floor, and seemed to hump the knuckles nervously, a giant crab readying to walk, or a blanket moving in its sleep.  you will remember, with a smile instructed by movies to reminisce, how strict her corsets must have been, how the huge arrangements of her hair would certainly betray the least impassionate displacement there. it was no rig for dallying, and maybe only marriage could derange that queenly scaffolding— as when a great ship, coming home, coasts in the harbor, dropping sail and loosing all the tackle that had laced her in the long lanes .... i know we need not draw this figure out. but all that whalebone came from whales. and all the whales lived in the sea, in calm beneath the troubled glass, until the needle drew their blood.  i see her standing in the hall, where the mirror’s lashed to blood and foam, and the black flukes of agony beat at the air till the light blows out.  
NEW POEM
 i used to think the mind essential in the body, even as stood the body essential in the mind: two inseparable things, by nature equal and similar, and in creation’s song halving the total scale: it is not so. unlike and cross like driftwood sticks they come churned in the giddy trough: a chunk of pine, a slab of rosewood: mangled each on each with knocks and friction, or in deadly pain sheathing each other’s splinters: till at last without all stuff or shape they ’re jetted up where in the bluish moisture rot whate’er was vomited in horror from the sea.  
NEW POEM
 then one day she noticed the forest had begun to bleed into her waking life.  there were curved metal plates on the trees to see around corners.  she thought to brush her hand against his thigh.  she thought to trace the seam of his jeans with her thumbnail.  the supersaturated blues were beginning to pixillate around the edges, to become a kind of grammar.  she placed a saucer of water under her lamp and counted mosquitoes as they drowned.  soot amassed in drifts in the corners of the room.  she pressed her thumb into the hollow of his throat for a while and then let him go.  
NEW POEM
 a gauze bandage wraps the land and is unwound, stained orange with sulfates.  a series of slaps molds a mountain, a fear uncoils itself, testing its long  cool limbs. a passing cloud seizes up like a carburetor  and falls to earth, lies broken- backed and lidless in the scree.  acetylene torches now snug in their holsters, shop-vacs  trundled back behind the dawn. a mist becomes a murmur, becomes  a moan deepening the dust- choked fissures in the rock o pity us  ignatz o come to us by moonlight o arch your speckled body over the earth.  
NEW POEM
 to prepare the body, aim for the translucent perfection you find in the sliced shavings of a pickled turnip. in order for this to happen, you must avoid the sun, protect the face under a paper parasol until it is bruised white like the skin of lilies. use white soap from a blue porcelain dish for this.  restrict yourself. eat the whites of things: tender bamboo shoots, the veins of the young iris, the clouded eye of a fish.  then wrap the body, as if it were a perfumed gift, in pieces of silk held together with invisible threads like a kite, weighing no more than a handful of crushed chrysanthemums. light enough to float in the wind. you want the effect of koi moving through water.  when the light leaves the room, twist lilacs into the lacquered hair piled high like a complicated shrine. there should be tiny bells inserted somewhere in the web of hair to imitate crickets singing in a hidden grove.  reveal the nape of the neck, your beauty spot. hold the arrangement. if your spine slacks and you feel faint, remember the hand-picked flower set in the front alcove, which, just this morning, you so skillfully wired into place. how poised it is! petal and leaf curving like a fan, the stem snipped and wedged into the metal base— to appear like a spontaneous accident.  
NEW POEM
 i speak this poem now with grave and level voice in praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall.  i praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise.  i praise the fall: it is the human season. now no more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth, enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth, nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough,  but now in autumn with the black and outcast crows share we the spacious world: the whispering year is gone: there is more room to live now: the once secret dawn comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes.  between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves and winter’s covering of our hearts with his deep snow we are alone: there are no evening birds: we know the naked moon: the tame stars circle at our eaves.  it is the human season. on this sterile air do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and on. i hear a dead man’s cry from autumn long since gone.  i cry to you beyond upon this bitter air.  
NEW POEM
 gushing from the mouths of stone men to spread at ease under the sky in granite-lipped basins, where iris dabble their feet and rustle to a passing wind, the water fills the garden with its rushing, in the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.  damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone, where trickle and plash the fountains, marble fountains, yellowed with much water.  splashing down moss-tarnished steps it falls, the water; and the air is throbbing with it; with its gurgling and running; with its leaping, and deep, cool murmur.  and i wished for night and you. i wanted to see you in the swimming-pool, white and shining in the silver-flecked water.  while the moon rode over the garden, high in the arch of night, and the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.  night and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!  
NEW POEM
 born into each seed is a small anti-seed useful in case of some complete reversal: a tiny but powerful kit for adapting it to the unimaginable. if we could crack the fineness of the shell we’d see the bundled minuses stacked as in a safe, ready for use if things don’t go well.  
NEW POEM
 there came gray stretches of volcanic plains, bare, lone and treeless, then a bleak lone hill like to the dolorous hill that dobell saw. around were heaps of ruins piled between the burn o’ sorrow and the water o’ care; and from the stillness of the down-crushed walls one pillar rose up dark against the moon. there was a nameless presence everywhere; in the gray soil there was a purple stain, and the gray reticent rocks were dyed with blood— blood of a vast unknown calamity. it was the mark of some ancestral grief— grief that began before the ancient flood.  
NEW POEM
 i guess these trailers lined up in the lot off the highway will do. i guess that crooked eucalyptus tree also. i guess this highway will have to do and the cars and the people in them on their way. the present is always coming up to us, surrounding us. it's hard to imagine atoms, hard to imagine hydrogen &amp; oxygen binding, it'll have to do. this sky with its macular clouds also and that electric tower to the left, one line broken free.  
NEW POEM
 old yew, which graspest at the stones that name the under-lying dead, thy fibres net the dreamless head, thy roots are wrapt about the bones.  the seasons bring the flower again, and bring the firstling to the flock; and in the dusk of thee, the clock beats out the little lives of men.  o not for thee the glow, the bloom, who changest not in any gale, nor branding summer suns avail to touch thy thousand years of gloom:  and gazing on thee, sullen tree, sick for thy stubborn hardihood, i seem to fail from out my blood and grow incorporate into thee.  
NEW POEM
 o sorrow, cruel fellowship, o priestess in the vaults of death, o sweet and bitter in a breath, what whispers from thy lying lip?  "the stars," she whispers, "blindly run; a web is wov'n across the sky; from out waste places comes a cry, and murmurs from the dying sun:  "and all the phantom, nature, stands— with all the music in her tone, a hollow echo of my own,— a hollow form with empty hands."  and shall i take a thing so blind, embrace her as my natural good; or crush her, like a vice of blood, upon the threshold of the mind?  
NEW POEM
 i sometimes hold it half a sin to put in words the grief i feel; for words, like nature, half reveal and half conceal the soul within.  but, for the unquiet heart and brain, a use in measured language lies; the sad mechanic exercise, like dull narcotics, numbing pain.  in words, like weeds, i'll wrap me o'er, like coarsest clothes against the cold; but that large grief which these enfold is given in outline and no more.  
NEW POEM
 by night we linger'd on the lawn, for underfoot the herb was dry; and genial warmth; and o'er the sky the silvery haze of summer drawn;  and calm that let the tapers burn unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd: the brook alone far-off was heard, and on the board the fluttering urn:  and bats went round in fragrant skies, and wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes that haunt the dusk, with ermine capes and woolly breasts and beaded eyes;  while now we sang old songs that peal'd from knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at ease, the white kine glimmer'd, and the trees laid their dark arms about the field.  but when those others, one by one, withdrew themselves from me and night, and in the house light after light went out, and i was all alone,  a hunger seized my heart; i read of that glad year which once had been, in those fall'n leaves which kept their green, the noble letters of the dead:  and strangely on the silence broke the silent-speaking words, and strange was love's dumb cry defying change to test his worth; and strangely spoke  the faith, the vigour, bold to dwell on doubts that drive the coward back, and keen thro' wordy snares to track suggestion to her inmost cell.  so word by word, and line by line, the dead man touch'd me from the past, and all at once it seem'd at last the living soul was flash'd on mine,  and mine in this was wound, and whirl'd about empyreal heights of thought, and came on that which is, and caught the deep pulsations of the world,  æonian music measuring out the steps of time—the shocks of chance— the blows of death. at length my trance was cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt.  vague words! but ah, how hard to frame in matter-moulded forms of speech, or ev'n for intellect to reach thro' memory that which i became:  till now the doubtful dusk reveal'd the knolls once more where, couch'd at ease, the white kine glimmer'd, and the trees laid their dark arms about the field:  and suck'd from out the distant gloom a breeze began to tremble o'er the large leaves of the sycamore, and fluctuate all the still perfume,  and gathering freshlier overhead, rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung the heavy-folded rose, and flung the lilies to and fro, and said  "the dawn, the dawn," and died away; and east and west, without a breath, mixt their dim lights, like life and death, to broaden into boundless day.  
NEW POEM
 when snow like sheep lay in the fold and winds went begging at each door, and the far hills were blue with cold, and a cold shroud lay on the moor,  she kept the siege. and every day we watched her brooding over death like a strong bird above its prey. the room filled with the kettle’s breath.  damp curtains glued against the pane sealed time away. her body froze as if to freeze us all, and chain creation to a stunned repose.  she died before the world could stir. in march the ice unloosed the brook and water ruffled the sun’s hair. dead cones upon the alder shook.  
NEW POEM
 gardens are also good places to sulk. you pass beds of spiky voodoo lilies and trip over the roots of a sweet gum tree, in search of medieval plants whose leaves, when they drop off turn into birds if they fall on land, and colored carp if they plop into water.  suddenly the archetypal human desire for peace with every other species wells up in you.the lion and the lamb cuddling up.

 for the second time this week i've watched snow fall at sunrise,  dawn arrive on a breeze  (the way i think it always does).  i don't know which, time or the weather,  woke me, charmed me out of a dream  where a few of us floated around,  gravity's jokers,  face-up in the quiet water  and the jetsam of a slow life.  i had one line that i'd saved  and let it go as though it were mine,  calling for “darker days and brighter gods!”  then i only had my waking instant,  but it opened with that same shadowless light,  a sense of change, of something both near  and remote, first and last,  blowing with the wind and snow  through my reflection in the window.  and then i lost it.   so here i am, with cigarettes and cold coffee,  an unfinished ode to idleness,  cobwebs in high places,  a spider that rappels down the bookshelves,  and a commotion recollected in tranquility;  sunlight pouring through,  and another bright page  with a peculiar darkness flowing over it  — shadows of heatwaves from the radiator,  or my thoughts going up in smoke.   the glass, when misted over,  reminds me of store windows,  how they're swathed with soap,  shrouded in secrecy  before a grand opening  or after an ignominious closing.  either way, not very interesting  except, perhaps, when the grafitti,  the anonymous messages appear  scrawled across them  by some child of the air,  words you can see through  or a clear smear.   and at twilight i'm still here,  the same place, the same light.  nothing to do but move with the view:  snow, wind over soft ruins,  unfinished buildings that loom  like monuments to a spent curiosity.  i'm in the tallest, up here with the nopes  roosting on soggy flunkgirders.  want a cigarette? nope.  got a match? nope.  see any alternative to solipsism? nope.  hedonism? nope. sloppy stoicism? nope.  did you know that maryland  has no natural but only man-made lakes? nope.   the creatures of idleness  are pure speculation.  they follow the weather,  shadow the wind, fill in the blanks.  some are big and clumsy and sly  and like to lick my watch;  others, like gerunds,  have already drunk themselves  into a state of being.  another, with time on his hands  and the sense of how windows  are both inside and outside a place,  stands there watching his silhouette  change to a reflection  as the light shifts  and he moves forward or back,  plays like a god  stepping in and out of himself,  and hears the wind as the breath of change  when the last flurry whirls away in the light.   the last flake grows larger  
NEW POEM
 a brilliance takes up residence in flaws— a brilliance all the unchipped faces of design refuse. the wine collects its starlets at a lip's fault, sunlight where the nicked glass angles, and affection where the eye is least correctable, where arrows of unquivered light are lodged, where someone else's eyes have come to be concerned.  for beauty's sake, assault and drive and burn the devil from the simply perfect sun. demand a birthmark on the skin of love, a tremble in the touch, in come a cry, and let the silverware of nights be flecked, the moon pocked to distribute more or less indwelling alloys of its dim and shine by nip and tuck, by chance's dance of laws.  the brightness drawn and quartered on a sheet, the moment cracked upon a bed, will last as if you soldered them with moon and flux. and break the bottle of the eye to see what lights are spun of accident and glass.  
NEW POEM
 in the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan, earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow, in the bleak midwinter, long ago.  our god, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign. in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed the lord god almighty, jesus christ.  enough for him, whom cherubim, worship night and day, breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay; enough for him, whom angels fall before, the ox and ass and camel which adore.  angels and archangels may have gathered there, cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; but his mother only, in her maiden bliss, worshipped the beloved with a kiss.  what can i give him, poor as i am? if i were a shepherd, i would bring a lamb; if i were a wise man, i would do my part; yet what i can i give him: give my heart.  
NEW POEM
 oil on limbs, maybe a rancid smell as on the chapel’s oil-press here, as on the rough pores of the unturning stone.  oil on hair wreathed in rope and maybe other scents unknown to us poor and rich and statuettes offering small breasts with their fingers.  oil in the sun the leaves shuddered when the stranger stopped and the silence weighed between the knees. the coins fell: ‘in the goddess’s name i summon you...’  oil on the shoulders and the flexing waist legs grass-dappled, and that wound in the sun as the bell rang for vespers as i spoke in the churchyard with a crippled man.  
NEW POEM
 he lowered his head and darted through the grass, flushing a hen from off her nest, then zeroing in on the day-old chicks instead of the mother whose decoy trick had failed to lure him away. in the time it took for me to notice this, he'd broken the necks of two of the chicks and torn the skin from off their backs and heads. the taste of their blood had deafened him to my commands, so i went to him like an angry god and chased him away with my staff and rod, inflicting a wound also in his side for him to go on licking, to wash their blood from off his tongue with his own blood, and then i kneeled in the grass to regard his kill while the mother keened inside the woods not far away. oh, what a mess they were with their heads snapped back and wings unhinged. i picked up the bodies like bloody socks and prayed to the god in charge of this field for my own weakness to feel this much for slaughtered chicks. for an understanding of his need to kill the most vulnerable thing, whether hungry or not.  
NEW POEM
 in the spring time the stars began looking for him by summer time they had found him by autumn time they had wounded him so that the orange and red of his blood began to leak from the sky onto the leaves of the trees by winter time they had slain him so that his white fat began to melt and drip falling as snow all over the land  and then he would begin to rise again first as sap in the trees stretching higher and higher until his back ached but knowing he would not stop until his black fur was hidden deep among the unborn behind the dark wall of the night sky

 i only a man harrowing clods in a slow silent walk with an old horse that stumbles and nods half asleep as they stalk.  ii only thin smoke without flame from the heaps of couch-grass; yet this will go onward the same though dynasties pass.  iii yonder a maid and her wight come whispering by: war’s annals will cloud into night ere their story die.  
NEW POEM
 colin, why this mistake? why plead thy foolish love? my heart shall sooner break than i a minion prove; nor care i half a rush, no snare i spread for thee: go home, my friend, and blush for love and liberty.  remembrance is my own — dominion bright and clear, truth there was ever known to combat every care: one image there impressed through life shall ever be whilst my innocuous breast owns love of liberty.  i ever taught thee how to prize the soul entire, when on the mountain’s brow i turned my rural lyre: thou servile art and vain, thy love unworthy me! away! nor hear my strain, of love or liberty.  what arts need i display to woo a soul like thine? thou ne’re canst know the way my memory to confine; for my eternal plan is to be calm and free. estranged from tyrant man i’ll keep my liberty.  yon woods their foliage wear, be thou away or nigh; the warblers of the year instruct me not to sigh: my tears ne’er roll the steep, nor swell the restless sea, except for those who sleep bereft of liberty.  slave to commanding eyes! those eyes thou wouldst commend my judgment must despise — my pity is thy friend: if eyes alone can move a swain so dull as thee, they mean but to reprove thy loss of liberty.  i stray o’er rocks and fields where native beauties shine: all fettered fancy yields be, colin, ever thine. complain no more! but rove — my cheek from crimson free, within my native grove i’ll guard my liberty.

 her terrace was the sand and the palms and the twilight.  she made of the motions of her wrist the grandiose gestures of her thought.  the rumpling of the plumes of this creature of the evening came to be sleights of sails over the sea.  and thus she roamed in the roamings of her fan,  partaking of the sea,

 in those days i thought their endless thrum was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights. in the throats of hibiscus and oleander  i’d see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells enameled hard as the sky before the rain. all that summer, my second, from city  to city my young father drove the black coupe through humid mornings i’d wake to like fever parceled between luggage and sample goods.  afternoons, showers drummed the roof, my parents silent for hours. even then i knew something of love was cruel, was distant.  mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid father’d pinned in her hair shriveled to a purple fist. a necklace of shells  coiled her throat, moving a little as she murmured of alligators that float the rivers able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes  whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years. and always the trance of blacktop shimmering through swamps with names like incantations—  okeefenokee, where father held my hand and pointed to an egret’s flight unfolding white above swamp reeds that sang with insects  until i was lost, until i was part of the singing, their thousand wings gauze on my body, tattooing my skin.  father rocked me later by the water, the motel balcony, singing calypso with the jamaican radio. the lyrics  a net over the sea, its lesson of desire and repetition. lizards flashed over his shoes, over the rail  where the citronella burned merging our shadows—father’s face floating over mine in the black changing sound  of night, the enormous florida night, metallic with cicadas, musical and dangerous as the human heart.

 1978-1979 for vincent woodard it is not just my problem. it belongs to us all. i have been cajoled into coming to the emergency room where everything scares me. black folk shoot and cut each other until they end here where guards have guns. i refuse to be taken upstairs and locked away. i was trying to think of a poem. it got me to this place. with my mother, i stand against the wall, guards on either side. they have guns, and this is my mother. it is now everybody’s problem. a bird is singing in my hair, more important than thorazine. my head is a tree stretching its leaves to burn in the sun. they say if i make a treaty to take the medicine, i can leave with my family since my family is crazy. i look at the guns on the hips of the guards and know i must be as still and quiet as death or this will turn into psychosis as sick as nightmares. i am angry that they would have me here with my mother, angry at white doctors. i am in a whale in the ocean. who can swim out to me? who can cast a line? if i take out the first guard by breaking his neck, i can protect my mother, but it is more important that we are all now underwater, inside a whale who laughs. later the therapist they say likes me keeps talking about the appointment. she is doing something subliminal with the word “come,” repeating, repeating. she leans to me when she says it. it bothers me that such people think crazy people are stupid, but it is more important that my head is a tree with a bird singing in it inside a whale in the ocean. the most important thing of all is that this whale that ate us likes to laugh a lot. he has the blues.

 i got a letter through the post decreeing my sainthood. beatified, i sat down, because this was big news for me. bless the television, bless this chair of four wooden legs. i felt like calling my parents, but thought, in a saintly way, to do so would be immodest, so instead i opened the curtains. rain was washing everything that seemed in need of washing. a bird landed on a bush and shook water from its wings and i closed my eyes briefly, acknowledging its small, hardworking soul, like a microchip destined for heaven. the cat came in, little devil, and i forgave her, touching under her chin, sweet child. we watched the news together and reflected that this was how the world churns its butter of beginnings and endings in front of the sun. what good, i wondered laterally, might befall an ancient tree today? perhaps merely nothing much. perhaps a tree will carry on just as it was. what minerals will develop unseen in the earth, deep beneath a human tragedy? some minerals. some salty, bright minerals in the dark. i spent that morning cutting white paper into triangles. i spent that afternoon staring at my bits, enamored. i spent that evening clapping loudly in the garden, and come bedtime i was ready to write my long email to the president of the united states of america.  
NEW POEM
 everything’s happening on the cusp of tragedy, the tip of comedy, the pivot of event. you want a placid life, find another planet. this one is occupied with the story’s arc: about to happen, on the verge, horizontal. you want another planet, try the moon. try any of the eight, try planet x. it’s out there somewhere, black with serenity. how interesting will our times become? how much more interesting can they become?  a crow with something dangling from its beak flaps onto a telephone pole top, daintily, and croaks its victory to other crows and tries to keep its morsel to itself. a limp shape, leggy, stunned, drops from the black beak’s scissors like a rag. we drive past, commenting, and looking upward. a sunny morning, too cold to be nesting, unless that is a nest the crow has seized, against the coming spring.  we’ve been at this historical site before, but not in any history we remember. the present has been cloaked in cloud before, and not on any holy mountaintop. to know the stars will one day fly apart so far they can’t be seen is almost a relief. for the future flies in one direction—toward us. and the only way to sidestep it—the only way—is headed this way, too.  so, look. that woman’s got a child by the hand. she’s dragging him across the street. he’s crying and she’s shouting, but we see only dumbshow. their breath is smoke. will she give in and comfort him? will he concede at last? we do not know. their words are smoke. in a minute they’ll be somewhere else entirely. everyone in a minute will be somewhere else entirely. as the crow flies.

 noon, march 6, 1997 from morning’s mouth the bones emerge, a prayer is whispered over rounded horns; the prairie is beyond the quivering hump and holy smoke sparkles released in the breath. braided sweetgrass, be about their hooves; although the grip of hunger lies heavy on the land, let endless native grasses grow among the yellow stones and between the stars. even if only one man had begun to sing, actually it was thousands, she who came to wisconsin farmers and transformed their lives, she who brought her blessing in the form of being newborn, she whom they named the miracle, white buffalo calf maiden must return amid the fast firing of bullets, along the most perilous of paths. rock stars, millionaires, they all offered millions of dollars to struggling white farmers but she had begun her transformation and her prophecy by touching them and they came to understand if not the actual words to the prayers at least the reverence, the need to protect, to keep the doors open. like it was a hundred years ago bounties are gathered from death; trains, buses, cars, planes carry the segmented body of the terrible worm across the land and the screams of the hunted split the sun awake. it is time to restore the stolen beads and shards, the bones and knives to every grave. and the graves are graves no longer but wombs; the bounties burn their hands and bones come flowing from museum shelves to dance in the rippling grass, rebuilding lungs, starting hearts. there must be a hundred men and a hundred men’s worth of heartlessness; wished they could find indians to kill but now that is illegal so they make up some excuse to raise their rifles and take aim, not hearing the rumble of buffalo prayer, not feeling tomorrow tremble or the prophecy of miracle, and smile as they see the legs give way, the horns gouge open the prairie ground, earth betrayed again.

 winter throws his great white shield on the ground, breaking thin arms of twisting branches, and then howls on the north side of the black mesa a deep, throaty laughter. because of him we have to sell our cattle that rake snow for stubble. having lived his whole life in a few weeks, slow and pensive he walks away, dragging his silver-stream shield down branches and over the ground, he keeps walking slowly away into death bravely.

 invisible fish swim this ghost ocean now described by waves of sand, by water-worn rock. soon the fish will learn to walk. then humans will come ashore and paint dreams on the dying stone. then later, much later, the ocean floor will be punctuated by chevy trucks, carrying the dreamers’ decendants, who are going to the store.

 for derek walcott   an island is one great eye gazing out, a beckoning lighthouse, searchlight, a wishbone compass, or counterweight to the stars. when it comes to outlook &amp; point of view, a figure stands on a rocky ledge peering out toward an archipelago of glass on the mainland, a seagull’s wings touching the tip of a high wave, out to where the brain may stumble.  but when a mind climbs down from its high craggy lookout we know it is truly a stubborn thing, &amp; has to leaf through pages of dust &amp; light, through pre-memory &amp; folklore, remembering fires roared down there till they pushed up through the seafloor &amp; plumes of ash covered the dead shaken awake worlds away,&amp; silence filled up with centuries of waiting.  sea urchin, turtle,&amp; crab came with earthly know-how, &amp; one bird arrived with a sprig in its beak, before everything clouded with cries, a millennium of small deaths now topsoil &amp; seasons of blossoms in a single seed. light edged along salt-crusted stones, across a cataract of blue water, &amp; lost sailors’ parrots spoke of sirens, the last words of men buried at sea.  someone could stand here contemplating the future, leafing through torn pages of st. augustine or the prophecies by fishermen, translating spore &amp; folly down to taproot. the dreamy-eyed boy still in the man, the girl in the woman, a sunny forecast behind today, but tomorrow’s beyond words. to behold a body of water is to know pig iron &amp; mother wit.  whoever this figure is, he will soon return to dancing through the aroma of dagger’s log, ginger lily,&amp; bougainvillea, between chants &amp; strings struck till gourds rally the healing air, &amp; till the church-steeple birds fly sweet darkness home. whoever this friend or lover is, he intones redemptive harmonies.  to lie down in remembrance is to know each of us is a prodigal son or daughter, looking out beyond land &amp; sky, the chemical &amp; metaphysical beyond falling &amp; turning waterwheels in the colossal brain of damnable gods, a eureka held up to the sun’s blinding eye, born to gaze into fire. after conquering frontiers, the mind comes back to rest, stretching out over the white sand.

 and the angel israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all god’s creatures. —koran in heaven a spirit doth dwell “whose heart-strings are a lute”; none sing so wildly well as the angel israfel, and the giddy stars (so legends tell), ceasing their hymns, attend the spell of his voice, all mute.  tottering above in her highest noon, the enamoured moon blushes with love, while, to listen, the red levin (with the rapid pleiads, even, which were seven,) pauses in heaven.  and they say (the starry choir and the other listening things) that israfeli’s fire is owing to that lyre by which he sits and sings— the trembling living wire of those unusual strings.  but the skies that angel trod, where deep thoughts are a duty, where love’s a grown-up god, where the houri glances are imbued with all the beauty which we worship in a star.  therefore, thou art not wrong, israfeli, who despisest an unimpassioned song; to thee the laurels belong, best bard, because the wisest! merrily live, and long!  the ecstasies above with thy burning measures suit— thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love, with the fervour of thy lute— well may the stars be mute!  yes, heaven is thine; but this is a world of sweets and sours; our flowers are merely—flowers, and the shadow of thy perfect bliss is the sunshine of ours.  if i could dwell where israfel hath dwelt, and he where i, he might not sing so wildly well a mortal melody, while a bolder note than this might swell from my lyre within the sky.

 today my brother brought over a piece of the ark wrapped in a white plastic grocery bag.  he set the bag on my dining table, unknotted it, peeled it away, revealing a foot-long fracture of wood. he took a step back and gestured toward it with his arms and open palms —  it’s the ark, he said. you mean noah’s ark? i asked. what other ark is there? he answered.  read the inscription, he told me, it tells what’s going to happen at the end. what end? i wanted to know. he laughed,what do you mean, “what end”? the end end.  then he lifted it out. the plastic bag rattled. his fingers were silkened by pipe blisters. he held the jagged piece of wood so gently. i had forgotten my brother could be gentle.  he set it on the table the way people on television set things when they’re afraid those things might blow-up or go-off — he set it right next to my empty coffee cup.  it was no ark — it was the broken end of a picture frame with a floral design carved into its surface.  he put his head in his hands —  i shouldn’t show you this — god, why did i show her this? it’s ancient — o, god, this is so old.  fine, i gave in,where did you get it? the girl, he said.o, the girl. what girl? i asked. you’ll wish you never knew, he told me.  i watched him drag his wrecked fingers over the chipped flower-work of the wood —  you should read it. but, o, you can’t take it — no matter how many books you’ve read.  he was wrong. i could take the ark. i could even take his marvelously fucked fingers. the way they almost glittered.  it was the animals — the animals i could not take —  they came up the walkway into my house, cracked the doorframe with their hooves and hips, marched past me, into my kitchen, into my brother,  tails snaking across my feet before disappearing like retracting vacuum cords into the hollows of my brother’s clavicles, tusks scraping the walls,  reaching out for him — wildebeests, pigs, the oryxes with their black matching horns, javelinas, jaguars, pumas, raptors. the ocelots with their mathematical faces. so many kinds of goat. so many kinds of creature.  i wanted to follow them, to get to the bottom of it, but my brother stopped me —  this is serious, he said. you have to understand. it can save you.  so i sat down, with my brother wrecked open like that, and two-by-two the fantastical beasts parading him. i sat, as the water fell against my ankles, built itself up around me, filled my coffee cup before floating it away from the table.  my brother — teeming with shadows — a hull of bones, lit only by tooth and tusk, lifting his ark high in the air.

 sometimes i wish i were still out on the back porch, drinking jet fuel with the boys, getting louder and louder as the empty cans drop out of our paws like booster rockets falling back to earth  and we soar up into the summer stars. summer. the big sky river rushes overhead, bearing asteroids and mist, blind fish and old space suits with skeletons inside. on earth, men celebrate their hairiness,  and it is good, a way of letting life out of the box, uncapping the bottle to let the effervescence gush through the narrow, usually constricted neck.  and now the crickets plug in their appliances in unison, and then the fireflies flash dots and dashes in the grass, like punctuation for the labyrinthine, untrue tales of sex someone is telling in the dark, though  no one really hears. we gaze into the night as if remembering the bright unbroken planet we once came from, to which we will never be permitted to return. we are amazed how hurt we are. we would give anything for what we have.

 i would imagine underneath those warming bear hugs was a kinda kind of soul as your many poems attest. those summer breezes. those many hazy sunsets nature’s voices echoing afar. a life continually fulfilled bordering on the empty and those inexplicable tragedies, those bad timings unreconciled, then reconciled with time. you had no answer that would satisfy your curiosity and the why, the wherewithal just round the bend. the morning mists descending in an angled quietude. a birdcall here and there. a rising wind unfurled and furling at the top-most branches of a conifer. those wetlands mysterioso. a last-known address unknown at last.  
NEW POEM
 i was the patriarch of the shining land, of the blond summer and metallic grain; men vanished at the motion of my hand, and when i beckoned they would come again.  the earth grew dense with grain at my desire; the shade was deepened at the springs and streams; moving in dust that clung like pillared fire, the gathering herds grew heavy in my dreams.  across the mountains, naked from the heights, down to the valley broken settlers came, and in my houses feasted through the nights, rebuilt their sinews and assumed a name.  in my clear rivers my own men discerned the motive for the ruin and the crime— gold heavier than earth, a wealth unearned, loot, for two decades, from the heart of time.  metal, intrinsic value, deep and dense, preanimate, inimitable, still, real, but an evil with no human sense, dispersed the mind to concentrate the will.  grained by alchemic change, the human kind turned from themselves to rivers and to rocks; with dynamite broke metal unrefined; measured their moods by geologic shocks.  with knives they dug the metal out of stone; turned rivers back, for gold through ages piled, drove knives to hearts, and faced the gold alone; valley and river ruined and reviled;  reviled and ruined me, my servant slew, strangled him from the figtree by my door. when they had done what fury bade them do, i was a cursing beggar, stripped and sore.  what end impersonal, what breathless age, incontinent of quiet and of years, what calm catastrophe will yet assuage this final drouth of penitential tears?

 there is joy in the woods just now, the leaves are whispers of song, and the birds make mirth on the bough and music the whole day long, and god! to dwell in the town in these springlike summer days, on my brow an unfading frown and hate in my heart always—  a machine out of gear, aye, tired, yet forced to go on—for i’m hired.  just forced to go on through fear, for every day i must eat and find ugly clothes to wear, and bad shoes to hurt my feet and a shelter for work-drugged sleep! a mere drudge! but what can one do? a man that’s a man cannot weep! suicide? a quitter? oh, no!  but a slave should never grow tired, whom the masters have kindly hired.  but oh! for the woods, the flowers of natural, sweet perfume, the heartening, summer showers and the smiling shrubs in bloom, dust-free, dew-tinted at morn, the fresh and life-giving air, the billowing waves of corn and the birds’ notes rich and clear:—  for a man-machine toil-tired may crave beauty too—though he’s hired.

 we’ve come back to the site of   her conception. she calls it why  and cries all night, sleepless, wild.  it seems the way is always floating and the goal —  to live so the ghosts we were don’t trail us and echo.  i think we are inside a flower, under a pollen of stars vast as scattered sand.  the air pulses with perfume, flowers calling to flowers and the ferrying air.  but my eyes are thin and elsewhere. i am thinking, maybe  even coming into the soul is a difficult birth, squeezed by the body’s vise.  my bent legs like pincers or the vegetable petals of some tropical flower.  even my mind gripped by the folds of   the flesh, how the cells keep twinning  themselves out toward complexity. the tulip trees of   the valley  spread their bone canopies into slick green leaves and fire flowers deep as cups.  their cups fill with rain, rain drinks the leaves drinking rain.  i can’t begin to explain. how on this porous peak of stone in the sea  our daughter came into me. little flick of a fish i could not see.  i was just learning to be human and upright among all that life.  and what was real was stranger than night with its dust of unnamed suns.  it was the beyond in us. and she was.

 "kinetics researcher from vienna [max thun-hohenstetin], 1930," by august sander  nakedness ought to be undatable, proof that the latest phenotype is made on the same plan as his original who sauntered through the garden, unafraid.  even without the cotton pouch he wears as a concession to the prudery of viewers not evolved enough to share his unembarrassed objectivity,  the willed detachment on his face would show, better than any clothes, the difference between the antique innocence that knows no shame, and cultivated shamelessness.

yes, fernand, who had talked lispingly of albers &amp; angkor vat. he had left the party without a word. how he got up, got into his coat, i do not know. when i saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter, he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself in some crack of the ruins. that it should have been he who said, “the kingfishers! who cares for their feathers now?”  his last words had been, “the pool is slime.” suddenly everyone, ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened, he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought “the pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why did the export stop?”  it was then he left   2  i thought of the e on the stone, and of what mao said la lumiere” but the kingfisher de l’aurore” but the kingfisher flew west est devant nous! he got the color of his breast from the heat of the setting sun!  the features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd &amp; 4th digit) the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings where the color is, short and round, the tail inconspicuous.  but not these things were the factors. not the birds. the legends are legends. dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher will not indicate a favoring wind, or avert the thunderbolt. nor, by its nesting, still the waters, with the new year, for seven days. it is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters. it nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. there, six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.  on these rejectamenta (as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born. and, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes a dripping, fetid mass  mao concluded: nous devons nous lever et agir!   3  when the attentions change / the jungle leaps in even the stones are split they rive  or, enter that other conqueror we more naturally recognize he so resembles ourselves  but the e cut so rudely on that oldest stone sounded otherwise, was differently heard  as, in another time, were treasures used:  (and, later, much later, a fine ear thought a scarlet coat)  “of green feathers    feet, beaks and eyes of gold  “animals likewise, resembling snails  “a large wheel, gold, with figures of unknown four-foots, and worked with tufts of leaves, weight 3800 ounces  “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills gold, the feet gold, the two birds perched on two reeds  gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds, one yellow, the other white.  “and from each reed hung seven feathered tassels.  in this instance, the priests (in dark cotton robes, and dirty, their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly over their shoulders) rush in among the people, calling on them to protect their gods  and all now is war where so lately there was peace, and the sweet brotherhood, the use of tilled fields.   4  not one death but many, not accumulation but change, the feed-back proves, the feed-back is the law  into the same river no man steps twice when fire dies air dies no one remains, nor is, one  around an appearance, one common model, we grow up many. else how is it, if we remain the same, we take pleasure now in what we did not take pleasure before?

the message is a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time  is the birth of the air, is the birth of water, is a state between the origin and the end, between birth and the beginning of another fetid nest  is change, presents no more than itself  and the too strong grasping of it, when it is pressed together and condensed, loses it  this very thing you are   ii  they buried their dead in a sitting posture serpent    cane    razor   ray of the sun  and she sprinkled water on the head of my child, crying “cioa-coatl! cioa-coatl!” with her face to the west  where the bones are found, in each personal heap with what each enjoyed, there is always the mongolian louse  the light is in the east. yes. and we must rise, act. yet in the west, despite the apparent darkness (the whiteness which covers all), if you look, if you can bear, if you can, long enough  as long as it was necessary for him, my guide to look into the yellow of that longest-lasting rose  so you must, and, in that whiteness, into that face, with what candor, look  and, considering the dryness of the place the long absence of an adequate race  (of the two who first came, each a conquistador, one healed, the other tore the eastern idols down, toppled the temple walls, which, says the excuser were black from human gore)  hear hear, where the dry blood talks where the old appetite walks  la piu saporita et migliore che si possa truovar al mondo  where it hides, look in the eye how it runs in the flesh / chalk  but under these petals in the emptiness regard the light, contemplate the flower  whence it arose  with what violence benevolence is bought what cost in gesture justice brings what wrongs domestic rights involve what stalks this silence  what pudor pejorocracy affronts how awe, night-rest and neighborhood can rot what breeds where dirtiness is law what crawls below   iii  i am no greek, hath not th’advantage. and of course, no roman: he can take no risk that matters, the risk of beauty least of all.  but i have my kin, if for no other reason than (as he said, next of kin) i commit myself, and, given my freedom, i’d be a cad if i didn’t. which is most true.  it works out this way, despite the disadvantage. i offer, in explanation, a quote: si j’ai du goût, ce n’est guères que pour la terre et les pierres.  despite the discrepancy (an ocean    courage    age) this is also true: if i have any taste it is only because i have interested myself in what was slain in the sun  i pose you your question:  shall you uncover honey / where maggots are?

 are you shaken, are you stirred by a whisper of love, spellbound to a word does time cease to move, till her calm grey eye expands to a sky and the clouds of her hair like storms go by?  then the lips that you have kissed turn to frost and fire, and a white-steaming mist obscures desire: so back to their birth fade water, air, earth, and the first power moves over void and dearth.  is that love? no, but death, a passion, a shout, the deep in-breath, the breath roaring out, and once that is flown, you must lie alone, without hope, without life, poor flesh, sad bone.

 today i watched a boy fly his kite. it didn’t crackle in the wind – but gave out a barely perceptible hum.  at a certain height, i’d swear i heard it sing. he could make it climb in any wind; could crank those angles up,  make it veer with the precision of an insect targeting a sting; then he’d let it roil in rapturous finesse, a tiny  bird in mid-air courtship. when lightning cracked across the cliff – (like quick pale flicks of yak-hair  fly-whisks) – he stayed steady. for so long he kept his arms up, as if he knew he’d hoist that kite enough.  i asked if it was made of special silk, if he used some particular string – and what he’d heard while holding it.  he looked at me from a distance, then asked about my alms bowl, my robes, and about that for which  a monk lives. it was then i saw i could tell him nothing in the cohort wind, that didn’t sound illusory.

 where is the grave of sir arthur o'kellyn? where may the grave of that good man be?— by the side of a spring, on the breast of helvellyn, under the twigs of a young birch tree! the oak that in summer was sweet to hear, and rustled its leaves in the fall of the year, and whistled and roared in the winter alone, is gone,—and the birch in its stead is grown.— the knight's bones are dust, and his good sword rust;— his soul is with the saints, i trust.

 or, a vision in a dream. a fragment. in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure-dome decree: where alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea. so twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round; and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; and here were forests ancient as the hills, enfolding sunny spots of greenery.  but oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! a savage place! as holy and enchanted as e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted by woman wailing for her demon-lover! and from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, a mighty fountain momently was forced: amid whose swift half-intermitted burst huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail: and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever it flung up momently the sacred river. five miles meandering with a mazy motion through wood and dale the sacred river ran, then reached the caverns measureless to man, and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean; and ’mid this tumult kubla heard from far ancestral voices prophesying war! the shadow of the dome of pleasure floated midway on the waves; where was heard the mingled measure from the fountain and the caves. it was a miracle of rare device, a sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!  a damsel with a dulcimer in a vision once i saw: it was an abyssinian maid and on her dulcimer she played, singing of mount abora. could i revive within me her symphony and song, to such a deep delight ’twould win me, that with music loud and long, i would build that dome in air, that sunny dome! those caves of ice! and all who heard should see them there, and all should cry, beware! beware! his flashing eyes, his floating hair! weave a circle round him thrice, and close your eyes with holy dread for he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of paradise.

 a few light flakes of snow fall in the feeble sun; birds sing in the cold, a warbler by the wall. the plum buds tight and chill soon bloom. the moon begins first fourth, a faint slice west at nightfall. jupiter half-way high at the end of night- meditation. the dove cry twangs like a bow. at dawn mt. hiei dusted white on top; in the clear air folds of all the gullied green hills around the town are sharp, breath stings. beneath the roofs of frosty houses lovers part, from tangle warm of gentle bodies under quilt and crack the icy water to the face and wake and feed the children and grandchildren that they love.

 day and night, the lake dreams of sky. a privacy as old as the mountains and her up there, stuck among peaks. the whole eye  fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars, so little trespass. an airplane once crossed her brow; she searched but could not find  a face. having lived with such strict beauty she comes to know how the sun is nothing but itself and the path it throws; the moon  a riddled stone. if only a hand would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. even the elk pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below—  how she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves her, as it sings all the way down the mountain.

 the hummingbird hovers over bougainvillea, darting in and out of blossoms as the bride throws  her corset among laughter and waving hands. seeing you, glass in hand, sunlight piercing the punch bowl’s crystal, i remember  the horse, an appaloosa, the white and gray markings like clouds, cumulus, one  later on his grave, the 2x4 cross with name above a swell of land that could bring a man to his knees,  or make him look up at fumbling shapes, cotton-fumed and slow. i can hear the screeching  still.the colt had grabbed a turkey nesting in scrub oak, and prancing, shook it in his mouth as we ran  reaching toward black feathers—then the ﬁne spray of blood—until beyond adrenaline we began laughing,

 spun silk of mercy, long-limbed afternoon, sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems. what better blessing than to move without hurry under trees? lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining house by now, roof and walls of vine— you could live inside this rose. pouring a slow stream around the ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit, i thought we would feel old by the year 2000. walt disney thought cars would fly.  what a drama to keep thinking the last summer the last birthday  
NEW POEM
 in the clear light that confuses everything only you, dark laurel, shadow my house,  lifting your arms in the anguish of nature at the stake. and at night, quivering with tears,  you are like the tree called tasso’s. crippled, and hooped with iron, it stands on peter’s hill.  when the lovers prop their bicycles and sit on the high benches that look across to eternity,  that tree makes their own torsion seem natural. and so, they’re comforted.   2 one of the local philosophers ... he says, “in california we have the old anarchist tradition.”  what can he mean? is there an anarchist tradition? and why would an anarchist want one? o california,  is there a tree without opinions? come, let me clasp you! let me feel the idea breathing.  i too cry o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts— “the sayling pine, the cedar proud and tall.”  like the girls in our neighborhood, they’re beautiful and silent.   3 as i was digging in the back yard i thought of a man in china. a lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other.  i could see and hear his heartbeats like a spade hurling clods. he pointed behind him, and i saw  that the hills were covered with armed men, and they were all on the other side of the life that i held dear.  he said, “we are as various as the twigs of a tree, but now the tree moves as one man.  it walks. and the earth trembles when a race of slaves is leaving.”   4 i said, “yet, all these people will fall down as one man when the entrails of a bomb are breathing.  when we came down from chosin carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear and all the dead we had to,  it was a time of forgetfulness, like a plucked string. it was a river of darkness.  was it not so on your side, when you came to the sea that was covered with ships? let us speak to each other,  let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air. that bird flies over the heads of the armed men.”   5 one part of the tree grows outward. the other i saw when, with a light, i explored the cellar—shattering roots.  they had broken through the wall, as though there were something in my rubbish that life would have at last.  i must be patient with shapes of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles. these things are the beginning  of things not visible to the naked eye. it was so in the time of tobit— the dish glowed when the angel held it.  it is so that spiritual messengers deliver their meaning.

 here i am saying “the leaves are falling” —one of those choruses that vie with interminable verses to mock hoarders. yeah, we get that a palette of winds is a pretty thing: one blurs the anther, another the river splurging on riprap, expunging phosphates, out of the temperature differential building sculptural fogs that promenade between shores a glacier wedged ajar, a fjord. whatever gives the river its seriousness reverses in the light of those clouds moving as if absorbing their pomp in advance of it— characters which untied the painter and took the sculls again.

 the deep male growl of the sea-lashed headland —sophocles, philoctetes august long ago, the summer lemnian (not like the deeds of those who killed their men), the self a glowing bead, like hephaestus falling daylong out of heaven in the old story, the island's interior a forge, a glory hole, the odor of wild thyme borne offshore steadily, the aegean sea purple, wine-dark, without epithet; and as i walked on the beach, my mother not long dead, the perfect crystal of my self-regard so lately flawed, and landscape made to echo my own low cry in the island's empty places, i found a pure white bone that wind and salt had scoured of every grief and all self-pity: and so i came to the love of others.

[plants and planets]   plants and planets obey the same heaven; as beasts and men are nourished by the same sun;  and the metal in the mine warms minute stars, sulphurous flowers so delicate they live in every corpuscule.  dwarves and giants are powder and dust thrown far without fall or check whirl to the four cornerless, angleless  worlds, peopled with angels, but others say not at all. their worlds seem fired from a cannon,  fired by whom by chance, this expanding consequence, the fruit of some grapeshot without any intelligence.

 let me tell you about my marvelous god, how he hides in the hexagons of the bees, how the drought that wrings its leather hands above the world is of his making, as well as the rain in the quiet minutes that leave only thoughts of rain. an atom is working and working, an atom is working in deepest night, then bursting like the farthest star; it is far smaller than a pinprick, far smaller than a zero and it has no will, no will toward us. this is why the heart has paced and paced, will pace and pace across the field where yarrow was and now is dust. a leaf catches in a bone. the burrow’s shut by a tumbled clod and the roots, upturned, are hot to the touch. how my god is a feathered and whirling thing; you will singe your arm when you pluck him from the air, when you pluck him from that sky where grieving swirls, and you will burn again throwing him back.

 the island’s dark tonight. the radio crackles with static, news of a blackout, the voice coming through first loud, then soft, as if a storm were moving to cut all lifelines off. my one-room cabin has a bed, a table, a chair. living this way, i understand better that scene by an anonymous illuminator: a row of monks eating at a rough table, diagonals of light slicing across the room to fall, as if by accident, on their simple meal. the black and white tiles on the floor a symbol of the formal repetitions of the simplest life, or maybe an oblique allusion to a paradox of theology: the complementary nature of good and evil. is evil possible here where everyone lives so individually and nature appears to be neutral toward everything but itself? some mornings i wake too suddenly, the light on the wall brilliant and unfamiliar, and wonder for a moment, where am i? i answer myself, my disembodied voice high and far off like what i imagine saints and martyrs heard in moments of ecstasy: swan’s island.  lightheaded, i rise, make coffee, settling into the simple ceremony of another morning. outside the sea birds pick the clam flats clean, fly off, returning late in the afternoon looking for more to scavenge. good days, i swim in the quarry, sun myself on the rocks, and plan a diary. one entry: i feel this place to be a rough approximation of heaven, the heaven of the lost ...

 october2017  you once said:my reward for this life will be a thousand pounds of dirt shoveled in my face. you were wrong. you are seven pounds of ashes in a box, a puerto rican flag wrapped around you, next to a red brick from the house in utuado where you were born, all crammed together on my bookshelf. you taught me there is no god, no life after this life, so i know you are not watching me type this letter over my shoulder.  when i was a boy, you were god. i watched from the seventh floor of the projects as you walked down into the street to stop a public execution. a big man caught a small man stealing his car, and everyone in brooklyn heard the car alarm wail of the condemned:he’s killing me. at a word from you, the executioner’s hand slipped from the hair of the thief.the kid was high, was all you said when you came back to us.  when i was a boy, and you were god, we flew to puerto rico. you said: my grandfather was the mayor of utuado. his name was buenaventura. that means good fortune. i believed in your grandfather’s name. i heard the tree frogs chanting to each other all night. i saw banana leaf and elephant palm sprouting from the mountain’s belly. i gnawed the mango’s pit, and the sweet yellow hair stuck between my teeth. i said to you:you came from another planet. how did you do it? you said:every morning, just before i woke up, i saw the mountains.  every morning, i see the mountains. in utuado, three sisters, all in their seventies, all bedridden, all pentecostales who only left the house for church, lay sleeping on mattresses spread across the floor when the hurricane gutted the mountain the way a butcher slices open a dangled pig, and a rolling wall of mud buried them, leaving the fourth sister to stagger into the street, screaming like an unheeded prophet about the end of the world. in utuado, a man who cultivated a garden of aguacate and carambola, feeding the avocado and star fruit to his nieces from new york, saw the trees in his garden beheaded all at once like the soldiers of a beaten army, and so hanged himself. in utuado, a welder and a handyman rigged a pulley with a shopping cart to ferry rice and beans across the river where the bridge collapsed, witnessed the cart swaying above so many hands, then raised a sign that told the helicopters:campamento los olvidados: camp of the forgotten.  los olvidados wait seven hours in line for a government meal of skittles and vienna sausage, or a tarp to cover the bones of a house with no roof, as the fungus grows on their skin from sleeping on mattresses drenched with the spit of the hurricane. they drink the brown water, waiting for microscopic monsters in their bellies to visit plagues upon them. a nurse says:these people are going to have an epidemic. these people are going to die. the president flips rolls of paper towels to a crowd at a church in guaynabo, zeus lobbing thunderbolts on the locked ward of his delusions. down the block, cousin ricardo, bernice’s boy, says that somebody stole his can of diesel. i heard somebody ask you once what puerto rico needed to be free. and you said:tres pulgadas de sangre en la calle: three inches of blood in the street. now, three inches of mud flow through the streets of utuado, and troops patrol the town, as if guarding the vein of copper in the ground, as if a shovel digging graves in the backyard might strike the ore below, as if la brigada swinging machetes to clear the road might remember the last uprising.  i know you are not god. i have the proof: seven pounds of ashes in a box on my bookshelf. gods do not die, and yet i want you to be god again. stride from the crowd to seize the president’s arm before another roll of paper towels sails away. thunder spanish obscenities in his face. banish him to a roofless rainstorm in utuado, so he unravels, one soaked sheet after another, till there is nothing left but his cardboard heart.  i promised myself i would stop talking to you, white box of gray grit. you were deaf even before you died. hear my promise now: i will take you to the mountains, where houses lost like ships at sea rise blue and yellow from the mud. i will open my hands. i will scatter your ashes in utuado.

 and remote, and useful, if only to itself. take the fly, angel of the ordinary house, laying its bright eggs on the trash, pressing each jewel out delicately along a crust of buttered toast. bagged, the whole mess travels to the nearest dump where other flies have gathered, singing over stained newsprint and reeking fruit. rapt on air they execute an intricate ballet above the clashing pirouettes of heavy machinery. they hum with life. while inside rumpled sacks pure white maggots writhe and spiral from a rip, a tear-shaped hole that drools and drips a living froth onto the buried earth. the warm days pass, gulls scree and pitch, rats manage the crevices, feral cats abandon their litters for a morsel of torn fur, stranded dogs roam open fields, sniff the fragrant edges, a tossed lacework of bones and shredded flesh. and the maggots tumble at the center, ripening, husks membrane-thin, embryos darkening and shifting within, wings curled and wet, the open air pungent and ready to receive them in their fecund iridescence. and so, of our homely hosts, a bag of jewels is born again into the world. come, lost children of the sun-drenched kitchen, your parents soundly sleep along the windowsill, content, wings at rest, nestled in against the warm glass. everywhere the good life oozes from the useless waste we make when we create—our streets teem with human young, rafts of pigeons streaming over the squirrel-burdened trees. if there is a purpose, maybe there are too many of us to see it, though we can, from a distance, hear the dull thrum of generation's industry, feel its fleshly wheel churn the fire inside us, pushing the world forward toward its ragged edge, rushing like a swollen river into multitude and rank disorder. such abundance. we are gorged, engorging, and gorgeous.

 on the ground can spook a horse who won’t flinch when faced with a backhoe or a pack of harleys. i call it “horse  ophthalmology,” because it is a different kind of system— not celestial, necessarily, but vision in which the small,  the wispy, the lightly lifted or stirring threads of existence excite more fear than louder and larger bodies do. it’s matthew  who said that the light of the body is the eye, and that if the eye is healthy the whole body will be full of light. maybe  in this case “light” can also mean “lightness.” with my eyes of corrupted and corruptible flesh i’m afraid i see mostly darkness  by which i mean heaviness. how great is that darkness? not as great as the inner weightlessness of horses whose eyes perceive,  correctly i believe, the threat of annihilation in every windblown dust mote of malignant life. all these years i’ve been watching  out warily in obvious places (in bars, in wars, in night cities and nightmares, on furious seas). yet what’s been trying to destroy  me has lain hidden inside friendly-seeming breezes, behind soft music, beneath the carpet of small things one can barely see.  the eye is also a lamp, says matthew, a giver of light, bestower of incandescent honey, which i will pour more cautiously  over the courses i travel from now on. what’s that whisper? just the delicate sweeping away of somebody’s life.

 on occasion, when the mood takes him as it so often does, he will put down  his papers, get up from his kindly old chair, and leave for a while the sweeping beam  to sow its charitable seed — that seed which, when falling on the ground  of a helmsman’s fertile consciousness, ought germinate in it a cautious vigilance.  he descends then, the long corkscrew of the stairs and opens at their base the metal door  so that he may take a closer look at what might be beyond his tower’s environs. there he always  finds the churning world, she laps at him from every side with no respite, and spatters him  with spray. thanks to a certain modulation, a tone which he adopted long ago  when he still wore shorts and buckled shoes, there is no danger here from neither shark  nor crocodile, not in this sea stuffed as it is like a dressing-up box with whimsy.  indeed, were there such creatures hidden neath the sliver-thin surface of the waves,  they’d have no teeth but only soft gray gums and goofy grins, and they’d be giggling  knowingly at the whole thing. and so it is that as he gazes out, he cannot help  but wonder what it is he might be warning of with the light that turns atop his tower,  because that tower is itself in fact the only hazard anywhere on which a ship might rip her  wooden skin and haemorrhage her lumpy blood that’s made of all the gasping sailormen.

 the rake is like a wand or fan, with bamboo springing in a span to catch the leaves that i amass in bushels on the evening grass.  i reckon how the wind behaves and rake them lightly into waves and rake the waves upon a pile, then stop my raking for a while.  the sun is down, the air is blue, and soon the fingers will be, too, but there are children to appease with ducking in those leafy seas.  so loudly rummaging their bed on the dry billows of the dead, they are not warned at four and three of natural mortality.  before their supper they require a dragon field of yellow fire to light and toast them in the gloom. so much for old earth’s ashen doom.

 i have come to the borders of sleep, the unfathomable deep forest where all must lose their way, however straight, or winding, soon or late; they cannot choose.  many a road and track that, since the dawn’s first crack, up to the forest brink, deceived the travellers, suddenly now blurs, and in they sink.  here love ends, despair, ambition ends; all pleasure and all trouble, although most sweet or bitter, here ends in sleep that is sweeter than tasks most noble.  there is not any book or face of dearest look that i would not turn from now to go into the unknown i must enter, and leave, alone, i know not how.  the tall forest towers; its cloudy foliage lowers ahead, shelf above shelf; its silence i hear and obey that i may lose my way and myself.

 one look at the lilac, one smell and my childhood is —  dogs scratching at the sliding glass door, bits  of bottles coming up  like grass in the grass, a dirty towel down by the feet  of the tree, lysol cans, small packets of land o’frost  turkey meat — there in front of me in spring,  in the wonderfully fat rain,  flowering purple and whatever the pinkish purple is called  and the white  ones too. they smell like my siblings, like the backs of my infant  son’s ears, like my son whom i would kill someone for.  before he was born i wouldn’t kill anyone. but now i would.  and after i’d get a coffee from starbucks, a coffee and a piece  of that amazing lemon-frosted lemon cake  and think nothing of it,  and read the paper and hold him against my chest  and listen to his body living, alive outside  his mother’s body, and the lilac outside on the street, outside  everyone, and heavy in the rain.  
NEW POEM
 poor muse, north wind, or any god who blusters bleak across the lake and sows the earth earth-deep with ice. a hoar of fur stung across the vines: here the leaves in full flush, here abandoned to four and farther winds. bless us, any god who crabs the apples and seeds the leaf and needle evergreen. what whispered catastrophe, winter. what a long night, beyond the lamplight, the windows and the frost-ferned glass. bless the traveler and the hearth he travels to. bless our rough hands, wind-scabbed lips, bless this our miscreant psalm.  
NEW POEM
 the cold earth slept below; above the cold sky shone; and all around, with a chilling sound, from caves of ice and fields of snow the breath of night like death did flow beneath the sinking moon.  the wintry hedge was black; the green grass was not seen; the birds did rest on the bare thorn’s breast, whose roots, beside the pathway track, had bound their folds o’er many a crack which the frost had made between.  thine eyes glow’d in the glare of the moon’s dying light; as a fen-fire’s beam on a sluggish stream gleams dimly—so the moon shone there, and it yellow’d the strings of thy tangled hair, that shook in the wind of night.  the moon made thy lips pale, beloved; the wind made thy bosom chill; the night did shed on thy dear head its frozen dew, and thou didst lie where the bitter breath of the naked sky might visit thee at will.  
NEW POEM
 i heard a thousand blended notes, while in a grove i sate reclined, in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind.  to her fair works did nature link the human soul that through me ran; and much it grieved my heart to think what man has made of man.  through primrose tufts, in that green bower, the periwinkle trailed its wreaths; and ’tis my faith that every flower enjoys the air it breathes.  the birds around me hopped and played, their thoughts i cannot measure:— but the least motion which they made it seemed a thrill of pleasure.  the budding twigs spread out their fan, to catch the breezy air; and i must think, do all i can, that there was pleasure there.  if this belief from heaven be sent, if such be nature’s holy plan, have i not reason to lament what man has made of man?

 nothing worth noting except an andromeda with quadrangular shoots— the boots of the people  wet inside: they must swim to church thru the floods or be taxed—the blossoms from the bosoms of the leaves   *   fog-thick morning— i see only where i now walk. i carry my clarity with me.   *   hear where her snow-grave is the you ah you  
NEW POEM
 anything can be a bird if you’re not careful. i should say something nice about the weather. i should be in awe of the living, but the world dulls when i step into it. the squirrels scatter, the branches lift. sure, i’ve hurt the ones i’ve loved by not paying attention.not alone — never alone is a lesson i need to understand. it was you who said that. it’s you still. you who says,look! you who points to the sky. you who tilts my chin toward the heron, who cups the minnow in your hands, who spots the deer miles ahead, who dulls the world with your absence. you who says,look! &amp; when i look, you are gone, replaced by the whitetail’s hind legs, fading into the bush.  
NEW POEM
 every morning the maple leaves. every morning another chapter where the hero shifts from one foot to the other. every morning the same big and little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out you will be alone always and then you will die. so maybe i wanted to give you something more than a catalog of non-definitive acts, something other than the desperation. dear so-and-so, i’m sorry i couldn’t come to your party. dear so-and-so, i’m sorry i came to your party and seduced you and left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing. you want a better story. who wouldn’t? a forest, then. beautiful trees. and a lady singing. love on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on. what a sweet lady. sing lady, sing! of course, she wakes the dragon. love always wakes the dragon and suddenly flames everywhere. i can tell already you think i’m the dragon, that would be so like me, but i’m not. i’m not the dragon. i’m not the princess either. who am i? i’m just a writer. i write things down. i walk through your dreams and invent the future. sure, i sink the boat of love, but that comes later. and yes, i swallow glass, but that comes later. and the part where i push you flush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks, shut up i’m getting to it. for a while i thought i was the dragon. i guess i can tell you that now. and, for a while, i thought i was the princess, cotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle, young and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with confidence but the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess, while i’m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire, and getting stabbed to death. okay, so i’m the dragon. big deal. you still get to be the hero. you get magic gloves! a fish that talks! you get eyes like flashlights! what more do you want? i make you pancakes, i take you hunting, i talk to you as if you’re really there. are you there, sweetheart? do you know me? is this microphone live? let me do it right for once, for the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes, you know the story, simply heaven. inside your head you hear a phone ringing and when you open your eyes only a clearing with deer in it. hello deer. inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion. hello darling, sorry about that. sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how i ruined everything by saying it out loud. especially that, but i should have known. you see, i take the parts that i remember and stitch them back together to make a creature that will do what i say or love me back. i’m not really sure why i do it, but in this version you are not feeding yourself to a bad man against a black sky prickled with small lights. i take it back. the wooden halls like caskets. these terms from the lower depths. i take them back. here is the repeated image of the lover destroyed. crossed out. clumsy hands in a dark room. crossed out. there is something underneath the floorboards. crossed out. and here is the tabernacle reconstructed. here is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all forgiven, even though we didn’t deserve it. inside your head you hear a phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you’re washing up in a stranger’s bathroom, standing by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away from the dirtiest thing you know. all the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly darkness, suddenly only darkness. in the living room, in the broken yard, in the back of the car as the lights go by. in the airport bathroom’s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of unnatural light, my hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away. and then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view of the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts. i arrived in the city and you met me at the station, smiling in a way that made me frightened. down the alley, around the arcade, up the stairs of the building to the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things, i looked out the window and said this doesn’t look that much different from home, because it didn’t, but then i noticed the black sky and all those lights. we walked through the house to the elevated train. all these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful mechanical wind. we were inside the train car when i started to cry. you were crying too, smiling and crying in a way that made me even more hysterical. you said i could have anything i wanted, but i just couldn’t say it out loud. actually, you said love, for you, is larger than the usual romantic love. it’s like a religion. it’s terrifying. no one will ever want to sleep with you.

 v. a. there are no doors between the rooms. the archways bore through the house like a tunnel through a mountain. the room one falls into after my parents’ is the largest and serves as two bedrooms divided by an invisible wall. half of it is my brother’s and the other half my sister and i share, but not at first.  earlier, i have a bed to myself on the side of the room nearest the kitchen. my bed is low and on one side a wooden rail can be dragged up noisily and clicked into place.  it is here my little goat wakes me, grabbing the covers off me with her teeth. we play in the empty pig shelter at the far end of the patio while my mother washes clothes in a palangana and throws the soapy water across the concrete, where it steams.  but my father is a butcher by profession, and my family has other plans for my goat: a sunday picnic at the zoo in havana. the day is huge and blue and breezy. my sister teases me for not eating and says my goat is delicious. i stray away to watch the monkeys.  i give one of the monkeys near the fence my banana. as it finishes peeling it meticulously, another monkey appears behind it and shoves the banana into its own mouth. the first monkey turns around, slaps it in the face with the empty peel, but that monkey isn’t sorry and starts jumping and screeching and showing its yellow teeth.  for many years, those monkeys are all i can remember about the picnic at the zoo.   b. later, when my sister and i share a bed on the other side of the room, i can see the tall narrow cabinet right inside my parents’ room. my father always puts his hat on top of it as he walks in. and at night, through the mosquito netting, it is a tall thin man wearing a straw hat, lurking just outside the door, watching me in a sinister way. the dead weight of my sister’s habitual leg thrown across my body is no talisman. i have to keep waking myself up, sweaty and tense, to make sure he hasn’t moved any closer.  
NEW POEM
 it was biting cold, and the falling snow, which filled a poor little match girl’s heart with woe, who was bareheaded and barefooted, as she went along the street, crying, “who’ll buy my matches? for i want pennies to buy some meat!”  when she left home she had slippers on; but, alas! poor child, now they were gone. for she lost both of them while hurrying across the street, out of the way of two carriages which were near by her feet.  so the little girl went on, while the snow fell thick and fast; and the child’s heart felt cold and downcast, for nobody had bought any matches that day, which filled her little mind with grief and dismay.  alas! she was hungry and shivering with cold; so in a corner between two houses she made bold to take shelter from the violent storm. poor little waif! wishing to herself she’d never been born.  and she grew colder and colder, and feared to go home for fear of her father beating her; and she felt woe-begone because she could carry home no pennies to buy bread, and to go home without pennies she was in dread.  the large flakes of snow covered her ringlets of fair hair; while the passers-by for her had no care, as they hurried along to their homes at a quick pace, while the cold wind blew in the match girl’s face.  as night wore on her hands were numb with cold, and no longer her strength could her uphold, when an idea into her little head came: she’d strike a match and warm her hands at the flame.  and she lighted the match, and it burned brightly, and it helped to fill her heart with glee; and she thought she was sitting at a stove very grand; but, alas! she was found dead, with a match in her hand!  her body was found half-covered with snow, and as the people gazed thereon their hearts were full of woe; and many present let fall a burning tear because she was found dead on the last night of the year,  in that mighty city of london, wherein is plenty of gold— but, alas! their charity towards street waifs is rather cold. but i hope the match girl’s in heaven, beside her saviour dear, a bright reward for all the hardships she suffered here.

 what a surprise it is to hear that locusts come the thirteenth year and not the seventeenth as told for ages and enshrined in old folklore and rhymes and family lies. the species similar otherwise: cicadas books call periodic, found here in our southern district. they grow from eggs pressed into twigs. the nymphs that hatch then start to dig at least ten inches into soil, and live by sucking juicy oil from roots and stems, sweet sap that nourishes through the giant nap, and then the lucky thirteenth year they grow a polished armor and crawl into the summer air and, louder than a mahler choir, fill meadow, hedge, and orchard grove with necessary calls for love, then leave their eggs to fortune's whim with philip glass-like requiem.

 in another poem, called the logic of spring, a mechanical drawing of a tree that i've passed a 100 times on my way to a different problem. i glance backwards, and the stack of the day multiplies, glancing backwards several times, the dog-eared corner with the graph paper sky of that morning and the logic of spring. right before i wake, i hear the riposte of mean jays (blue dots that drag the pink banners of answers off the tree with words in gold italic latin) from the fog pumped in by the machine set on my lawn. first thing in the morning, (page numbers in all the dish rags hanging around the sink) i part the buttery curtains to see beyond the doric columns sitting on my porch &amp; the hibiscus twig that someone has set the stump of such a tree—gray smudges and still intact line breaks with flashing pink splashes— outside my house while i slept. seems unbearably cruel until i realize that in the flapping fog i finally hear its questions. are you so easily distracted by pieces of a poem attached to a tree? in which as the situation changes you catch glimpses of yourself a series of emoticons.

 i see it as it looked one afternoon in august,— by a fresh soft breeze o’erblown. the swiftness of the tide, the light thereon, a far-off sail, white as a crescent moon. the shining waters with pale currents strewn, the quiet fishing-smacks, the eastern cove, the semi-circle of its dark, green grove. the luminous grasses, and the merry sun in the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide, laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirp of crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide, light summer clouds fantastical as sleep changing unnoted while i gazed thereon. all these fair sounds and sights i made my own.

 i.   five soldiers fixed by mathew brady’s eye stand in a land subdued beyond belief. belief might lend them life again. i try like orphaned hamlet working up his grief  to see my spellbound fathers in these men who, breathless in their amber atmosphere, show but the postures men affected then and the hermit faces of a finished year.  the guns and gear and all are strange until beyond the tents i glimpse a file of trees verging a road that struggles up a hill. they’re sycamores. the long-abated breeze  flares in those boughs i know, and hauls the sound of guns and a great forest in distress. fathers, i know my cause, and we are bound beyond that hill to fight at wilderness.   ii.   but trick your eyes with birnam wood, or think how fire-cast shadows of the bankside trees rode on the back of simois to sink in the wide waters. reflect how history’s  changes are like the sea’s, which mauls and mulls its salvage of the world in shifty waves, shrouding in evergreen the oldest hulls and yielding views of its confounded graves  to the new moon, the sun, or any eye that in its shallow shoreward version sees the pebbles charging with a deathless cry and carageen memorials of trees.    iii.   now, old man of the sea, i start to understand: the will will find no stillness back in a stilled land.  the dead give no command and shall not find their voice till they be mustered by some present fatal choice.  let me now rejoice in all impostures, take the shape of lion or leopard, boar, or watery snake,  or like the comber break, yet in the end stand fast and by some fervent fraud father the waiting past,  resembling at the last the self-established tree that draws all waters toward its live formality.

 the sounds of traffic die over the back lawn to occur again in the low distance.  the voices, risen, of the neighborhood cannot maintain that pitch and fail briefly, start up again.  similarly my breathing rises and falls while i look out the window of apartment number three in this slum, hoping for rage, or sorrow.  they don’t come to me anymore. how can i lament anything? it is all so proper, so much as it should be, now  the nearing cumulus clouds, ominous, shift, they are like the curtains, billowy, veering at the apex of their intrusion on the room. if i am alive now, it is only  to be in all this making all possible. i am glad to be finally a part of such machinery. i was after all not so fond of living, and there comes into me, when i see how little i liked being a man, a great joy.  look out our astounding clear windows before evening. it is almost as if the world were blue with some lubricant, it shines so.

 but for a low bank of cloud, clear morning, empty sky.  the bright band of light beneath the cloud’s gray i thought at first was open distance, but it’s ice  that by extension raised the lake above the lip of blue lake and spilled it farther out than that horizon  along the sky and floods the clouds.   seeing the distant level further unfurl into the sky says not to trust  blue line as terminus when a meniscus of ice  can ride up that wall of the skyline, a measure of illusion how close  the eye can be to filled with seeing, to widen instead the tube of that measure   of sight we are given. there is the larger lake the wider look we open  eyes to see. that glance of the lip put in a bigger cylinder falls away,  but how much deeper the spring to fill the cup.  as if the surface we are seeing drops the more seeing is added,   while we feel the stories well as our height from which to see. and watch the dawns coming.  …i seem to be emptying of time the more time i put in,  and see like a man with weathered eyes enough to face to face up to the sight’s field expanded  to insight. to the dark the lake can turn and curl up like a map for poems to have   these likenesses to graph, then come un-scrolled from semblance back  to just this lake. water cities are led to layout  beside. but never in stillness; always the restoration to change,  from ice, from cloud, turning to clear liquid—as is most of our body   water— thinned sheet, layer that if written on or with, a bearing  a name chiseled on water disappears.

 alone i list in the leafy tryst; silent the woodlands in their starry sleep— silent the phantom wood in waters deep: no footfall of a wind along the pass startles a harebell—stirs a blade of grass. yonder the wandering weeds, enchanted in the light, stand in the gusty hollows, still and white; yonder are plumy reeds, dusking the border of the clear lagoon; far off the silver clifts hang in ethereal light below the moon; far off the ocean lifts, tossing its billows in the misty beam, and shore-lines whiten, silent as a dream: i hark for the bird, and all the hushed hills harken: this is the valley: here the branches darken the silver-lighted stream.  hark— that rapture in the leafy dark! who is it shouts upon the bough aswing, waking the upland and the valley under? what carols, like the blazon of a king, fill all the dawn with wonder? oh, hush, it is the thrush, in the deep and woody glen! ah, thus the gladness of the gods was sung, when the old earth was young; that rapture rang, when the first morning on the mountains sprang: and now he shouts, and the world is young again! carol, my king, on your bough aswing! thou art not of these evil days— thou art a voice of the world’s lost youth: oh, tell me what is duty—what is truth— how to find god upon these hungry ways; tell of the golden prime, when bird and beast could make a man their friend ; when men beheld swift deities descend, before the race was left alone with time, homesick on earth, and homeless to the end; before great pan was dead, before the naiads fled; when maidens white with dark eyes shy and bold, with peals of laughter on the peaks of gold, startled the still dawn— shone in upon the mountains and were gone, their voices fading silverly in depths of forests old. sing of the wonders of their woodland ways, before the weird earth-hunger of these days, when there was rippling mirth, when justice was on earth, and light and grandeur of the golden age; when never a heart was sad, when all from king to herdsman had a penny for a wage. ah, that old time has faded to a dream— the moon’s fair face is broken in the stream; yet shout and carol on, o bird, and let the exiled race not utterly forget; publish thy revelation on the lawns— sing ever in the dark ethereal dawns; sometime, in some sweet year, these stormy souls, these men of earth may hear.  but hark again, from the secret glen, that voice of rapture and ethereal youth now laden with despair. forbear, o bird, forbear: is life not terrible enough forsooth? cease, cease the mystic song— no more, no more, the passion and the pain: it wakes my life to fret against the chain; it makes me think of all the agéd wrong— of joy and the end of joy and the end of all— of souls on earth, and souls beyond recall. ah, ah, that voice again! it makes me think of all these restless men called into time—their progress and their goal; and now, oh now, it sends into my soul dreams of a love that might have been for me— that might have been—and now can never be.  tell me no more of these— tell me of trancéd trees; (the ghosts, the memories, in pity spare) show me the leafy home of the wild bees; show me the snowy summits dim in air; tell me of things afar in valleys silent under moon and star: dim hollows hushed with night, the lofty cedars misty in the light, wild clusters of the vine, wild odors of the pine, the eagle’s eyrie lifted to the moon— high places where on quiet afternoon a shadow swiftens by, a thrilling scream startles the cliff, and dies across the woodland to a dream.  ha, now he springs from the bough, it flickers—he is lost! out of the copse he sprang; this is the floating briar where he tossed: the leaves are yet atremble where he sang here a long vista opens—look! this is the way he took, through the pale poplars by the pond: hark! he is shouting in the field beyond. ho, there he goes through the alder close! he leaves me here behind him in his flight, and yet my heart goes with him out of sight! what whispered spell of faëry calls me on from dell to dell? i hear the voice—it wanders in a dream— now in the grove, now on the hill, now on the fading stream.  lead on—you know the way lead on to arcady, o’er fields asleep; by river bank abrim; down leafy ways, dewy and cool and dim; by dripping rocks, dark dwellings of the gnome, where hurrying waters dash their crests to foam. i follow where you lead, down winding paths, across the flowery mead, down silent hollows where the woodbine blows, up water-courses scented by the rose. i follow the wandering voice— i follow, i rejoice, i fade away into the age of gold— we two together lost in forest old.- o ferny and thymy paths, 0 fields of aidenn, canyons and cliffs by mortal feet untrod! o souls that are weary and are heavy laden, here is the peace of god !  lo! now the clamoring hours are on the way: faintly the pine tops redden in the ray; from vale to vale fleet-footed rumors run, with sudden apprehension of the sun; a light wind stirs the filmy tops of delicate dim firs, and on the river border blows, breaking the shy bud softly to a rose. sing out, o throstle, sing: i follow on, my king: lead me forever through the crimson dawn— till the world ends, lead me on! ho there! he shouts again—he sways—and now, upspringing from the bough, flashing a glint of dew upon the ground, without a sound he drops into a valley and is gone!

 if you believe in snow, you have to believe in water as it's meant to be, loosed  from clouds arranged like asphodel. because that's what it's like to come back: a slow  surfacing, memory spiraling away. you can sleep so long, whole seasons are forgotten  like a hospital-room plaster, spidered with cracks in portugal shapes. you can love  sleep like water, love your heavy limbs pushing river and ocean aside.  after maggie woke, the doctors had her stringing bracelets of semiprecious beads, and she  couldn't stop counting the kinds of blue. here, summer, in the high shade of a ginko,  she pulls up a handful of stones on silk and we drink grapefruit seltzer, listening  to the tinny chime of bubbles rising to the air. she can't remember  autumn, so we tell her someday this tree will drop its fan-shaped leaves all at once,  golden in the october crush of every plant's frantic strip show. later  we'll see mountains through the scrim of empty branches, and if we can look straight up  into the atmosphere, see the same plain old sky revolving. when we ask maggie what color it is  she always says iolite, picturing beads like raindrops, shining azure on the table.  she forgets that sometimes things don't stay where you leave them, that the sky fades  to white even before snow begins to fall. it's hard, but we have to tell her  even sapphires don't glow blue without some kind of help.

 on turning forty they draw me closer like the hands of one grandmother i kissed upon visiting her in the barrio. the magnets make me look at my waist, wondering why the ache is in the street, houses giving off stinking air, a magnetic field collecting old newspapers, broken-down cars, alleys where the drummer cowers before he beats on his bag of beer cans.  i visit the irrigation canal that churns green and flows beyond the streets, wait for the alligator to swim by, the one released from the plaza long ago. i feel the pull toward the mongrel dog, the clicking of the magnets in the church, an attraction for open doorways.  *  i remove the magnet from my neck, a medal of a denied saint. i will never witness the migration of bats again, stand at the entrance of the caverns as bats shoot out of the opening, the evening bristling with their intelligence.  the sky bruises against the horizon of yucca plants erect as magnets surrrounding the cavern, miles of yucca encircling the poles to protect them from the wind that pulls me into the hole.  *  he tells me to believe what i have seen, insists magnetic force comes from the blade, the woman wanting us to keep something for her. he says magnets are missing metals from an underground wound, a husband’s wrist broken by a slammed car hood, loyal dance of an old couple watching the street.  he says tortillas and menudo attract flies. he learned red chili kills all life, insists magnets let him sleep fulfilled, delicious food he fixes long after his wife has died.  he cries that the magnets get stronger when he peels the pods to find no difference in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love.  *  i climb the rocks because the minerals are there, ascend to where i buried the seashell, rusted can, and pencil twenty-eight years ago. i reach the rocks because i am allowed one mountain, climbing to readjust the magnets. then, i stand and look down.  i clear my chest of a fist encountered up here, set my foot on the humming slab. i move to survive when i touch my heart. i climb higher before deciding to bend and dig.

 she always got mad at him every time he came home in the middle of the morning with his pant legs wet. she knew he had fallen in the ditch again. his legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches. he was too old to be walking over temporary dikes. she wished he didn’t do that, but sometimes he had to. she sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches, his head hitting hard cement, his body slowly sinking into the water. water that was only three feet deep. a harmless three feet of water, where children played, and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet, especially on hot summer evening. she knew he would drown, she knew it was bound to happen sometime.  as far as the eye could see, flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains. mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like. fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage place beneath the earth’s surface.  we are called “the people of the cotton fields” because of the labor our families did. for us there was no reservation, no housing &amp; urban development, no tribal support. we were a people segregated in row houses all lined up along the roads of our labor.  it is a muggy summer evening. my father, my sister, and i sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun. the change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally, to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.  on this evening the anticipation is shattered. a boy comes to the house. he gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing. with what the boy says to him my father moves quickly. as quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him. back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy. he rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat. he gets into his truck and drives away.  we pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing. a second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off. in a tone i recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her. she starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house. my sister and i walk beside her. saying nothing. her hands wring the towel she carries with her. this towel, a multipurpose kind of thing. women carry it to fan themselves, to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies. i remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university. whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.  we continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton. rows of cotton my family and i know well. in early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth, and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals. and in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks. now i can’t begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked, up and back, up and back along these rows.  we walk alongside her. the setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs, the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms. she heads toward the irrigation ditch. the ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery. the water is shallow. i see my father’s truck pulling up on the opposite side. in the front seat there are women, and in the back, men. the men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes. equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields. i remember the hoe he carried. it was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done. i recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship. “they call this a hoe?” i said to my husband. it had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of. the handle was too thin, causing blisters. once in awhile i look around for the type of hoe my father carried. i found one once, but didn’t have money to buy it.  in slow motion, weighed down by the heat, the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck. they slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging. in cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch. my mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string, is pulled toward them from the opposite side. their movement is dreamlike. they peer into the muddy water. and as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying, motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces. with a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail. this sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.  
NEW POEM
 i ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight, the ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight; the breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade that the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night, nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made, march, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite.  ii and now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow, and the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low, how should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born so strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn? thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow as a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn, takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow.  iii fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed, those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers, each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers, but fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed, as a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's, one hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed.  iv as the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as april subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to may; so time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away, and leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou, bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now? for somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play, must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey.  v are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea? are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath? is it march with the wild north world when april is waning? the word that the changed year saith, is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death and kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free?  vi for the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song, glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong, thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine, days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine, and sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng, and the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine, and earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong.  vii thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch, and the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch: wild april, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow, calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow, and his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch; for the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow, and the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of march.

 for r. l. b. for all the far-flung continents he'd crossed, revealing lands they found beyond belief; for all the roads that lay behind him, lost in caverns of some atavistic grief  he'd carried with him since he was a boy; for all the years, he should be weary now. how then could he explain this welling joy, a old man on a wintry beach? or how  it seemed the wind bore perfumes of a whole new wilderness, a lush and green brazil over the dim horizon of his soul, farther than memory, beyond his will,  where even now, in vibrant canopies, the twilight songs of bird to hidden bird rose up in wild, untutored harmonies more lovely for their never being heard.

 1   “with never a whisper on the main,” so the snow falls, glaring through the festschrift of acacia leaves at sunrise and seeping a dye of immortelle on mild fleece, shrinking back eternity to flurries stalking summer cairns. somewhere, harpies in cruisers blare beneath prairie clouds. an iceberg flashes, turns a smoke of ice on the air. the cold repels, draws out redoubling whites; in the green heat you hallucinate where the sea runs, light on light, creeping the heights your new turret on the house in clouds scorns nothing: poetry’s sub rosa, ever uncompromised, as now, infrared crows eclipse the lawns.   2   and i once brute and stammering to you toppled in a blue beach chair, pushed to the meridian-hush island coup talk, but your eyes search out where children leap hotels’ sand dams and worry the guard and his dog. the triumph of surrender, of love flamed from history, like that pyro-tailor’s scissors bright roar, reducing the “treasury of the poor.” you sputter into a blinding cough and recover with, “emerson?” yes, that culprit all along, new to me, so was boston common when we waited in the trash fire of autumn and could feel salt driving off the atlantic.   3   where the mezcal ferns begin and after them dross wet soil rises from bank to ridge, sunset’s slow inflation; you point; they change in one stroke to mountain-blue foliage! on utility poles hang night’s recessive fable. again, you stab the windscreen    ...out there, abundant still lifes, the stark inflammable river you will cross over, recoil at the pier. what value is the ride? in digression, art. a mare froths in the sea the following day. it seems, gathered up by spokes of clouds, caught in an agonizing conversion. you jolt towards it, but out laughed a schoolboy, way too happy — “o apilo!” — sun-blasted, all colors.   4   clinking cavalcade inching up the sunday road lined with crowds: none anonymous, moving as lines do, growing in depth of play, unstable and absolute where they must. each thing has a crack, indeed. adjust the mirror beyond the surf’s exhortation and see arched dolphins at equinox blur with drizzle port antonio into vigie. half mile of bamboo cathedral tunnels an airy pass there once; its shadows hacked away and in that vacancy light depreciates now. geography is not fate but fatal. gone is the corridor to hold your glory. the sun and sea in your eyes still bow.   5   pilgrim of occasional fireflies, brooding inside the alliance française pyramid, where the wild honey expires and the doggerel air embalms all you’ve lived, relived with lament and praise. pain’s license. silence, then the reciprocity of silence, its immense language sends an ibis to absolve and to mark your sins. late-in-life astonishment, like bitcoins on the tongue. what you say is hidden in noon gossip. yes, having a gift is to be called. since it is given, let it go. the mind irons bronze in water, a voice radiating: “we please our elders when we sit enthralled.”   6   ascend and bless the devil’s altitude. shale drifting from the sky’s blue furnace. slant sparks of green off the vale santa cruz below, being so blessed, this is penance, of a kind, my own road to emmaus, wafers upon wafers of oleanders suture those eyes scattered and staring through dust. around each bend arrives the future, which departs exactly close to lalibela one fleeting night the rock churches wept by my ears, refracted stoney hill’s stars, their ragged music pitching diaspora against despair. such music you’ve left withstands permanently the striation of scars.   7   to evening air i add, “blown cane blown cane blown cane,” and step into the quattrocento outside the library by the pier. all’s changed. blown i am a broad antillean echo lost in the marrow wings of a pelican, or an albatross, cloud remnant, tasseled low flyer below the radar of the wind. trade winds. travailed not traveled. shit-bloodied. a million blades choir and collapse on repeat their absolute, surging pledge, picked up by potholes which i jump to reach home. blown canes, singed from the african holocaust. dark breaks in me carrying your line, lucid sandglass, seething uphill. mine to keep and give.   8   the kite season is early. little insurgence everywhere of souls lifting, subsiding half transparent in night’s green silence. by morning they are fallen over the cement fence, your childhood allamandas annunciate your last withdrawal into heat so fierce it breaks its own laws and the man into tears along lapeyrouse seawall, his umbrella kite shielding the sun from the murals. meantime, i hesitate on a maroon canal in delft, crossing water’s filial piety, erring rings whisper “small honors in the storm” and watch moss lilies drift into untouchable maze, fastened to each other. your ancestors’ spires are of ambergris, they magnify in the water my spectral self.

 when the wind was right everything else was wrong, like the oak we thought built better than the house split like a ship on a rock. we let it stand the winter, spectral, shagged, every sky its snow, then cut it down, dismantled it in pieces like disease. then limbs from the yellow poplar broke at will— fell from the heights like bones of the puritans; even to gather them in bundles seemed puritanical. and the willow, by its nature, wept long tears of its overbranching, so pale they were autumnal. these we turned too easily to switches, mocking the bickering in the spruce's nesting eaves, which crows, then jays bothered all they could. the list, the list. the sycamore made maps of disappearance; the copper beech, parental in its girth, was clipped hard, by a car, with a wound that wouldn't heal. doctoring, then witchery, then love—nothing we tried would work. more apple trees that grew nowhere but down. more maples spilling sugar. more hawthorns blazing out, telling truth.

 a thin wet sky, that yellows at the rim, and meets with sun-lost lip the marsh’s brim.  the pools low lying, dank with moss and mould, glint through their mildews like large cups of gold.  among the wild rice in the still lagoon, in monotone the lizard shrills his tune.  the wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering, where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling.  late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight, sail up the silence with the nearing night.  and like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil, steals twilight and its shadows o’er the swale.  hushed lie the sedges, and the vapours creep, thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep.

 i  i’ve felt undeserving. i’ve made myself ill with the glory, in the unleavened garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake. what made me cover that which i could not have?  i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs, i’ve felt undeserving. i’ve made myself ill with the glory. even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. i disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent’s hiss.  i remember seasons, things i bring from far away, and grieve. i walk in catacombs. in gardens now, by the stone walls, sunlight closes, the falling leaves gesture their renunciation.  i remember being in a field touching a man’s body. i remember seasons, things i bring from far away and things that hold their breath for shame. his skin was soft as a girl’s and he closed his eyes.  i placed apple petals on his eyelids; we were lying in a field and i touched his body. then there were clouds, an uncanny silence, as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame.  what made me covet what i could not have? ill with the power and glory, a thrashing in my chest, i remember the unleavened gardens, petals falling singly, the yellow snake disgorging lies.   ii  i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs. i’ve felt undeserving. i’ve made myself ill with the glory, power and glory-- a thrashing in my rib cage.  i’ve gone into the unleavened spring garden, disgorged the lies, and scared away with a stick a snake. i’ve grieved and walked in catacombs.  what made me cover that which i could not have? i’ve felt undeserving. in this bright land that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow, i remember seasons, things i bring with me from far away  and things that hold their breath as if for shame. i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory. i’ve gone into the unleavened garden and startled a yellow snake  disgorging lies. a thrashing in my rib cage. what made me cover what i could not have? i remember   seasons. things that hold their breath for shame. things i bring with me from far away.   iii  i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory. i’ve made myself ill with the power and glory.

 a monodrama come into the garden, maud, for the black bat, night, has flown, come into the garden, maud, i am here at the gate alone; and the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, and the musk of the rose is blown.  for a breeze of morning moves, and the planet of love is on high, beginning to faint in the light that she loves in a bed of daffodil sky, to faint in the light of the sun she loves, to faint in his light, and to die.  all night have the roses heard the flute, violin, bassoon; all night has the casement jessamine stirr'd to the dancers dancing in tune; till a silence fell with the waking bird, and a hush with the setting moon.  i said to the lily, "there is but one with whom she has heart to be gay. when will the dancers leave her alone? she is weary of dance and play." now half to the setting moon are gone, and half to the rising day; low on the sand and loud on the stone the last wheel echoes away.  i said to the rose, "the brief night goes in babble and revel and wine. o young lord-lover, what sighs are those, for one that will never be thine? but mine, but mine," so i sware to the rose, "for ever and ever, mine."  and the soul of the rose went into my blood, as the music clash'd in the hall; and long by the garden lake i stood, for i heard your rivulet fall from the lake to the meadow and on to the wood, our wood, that is dearer than all;  from the meadow your walks have left so sweet that whenever a march-wind sighs he sets the jewel-print of your feet in violets blue as your eyes, to the woody hollows in which we meet and the valleys of paradise.  the slender acacia would not shake one long milk-bloom on the tree; the white lake-blossom fell into the lake as the pimpernel dozed on the lea; but the rose was awake all night for your sake, knowing your promise to me; the lilies and roses were all awake, they sigh'd for the dawn and thee.  queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls, come hither, the dances are done, in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, queen lily and rose in one; shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, to the flowers, and be their sun.  there has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate. she is coming, my dove, my dear; she is coming, my life, my fate; the red rose cries, "she is near, she is near;" and the white rose weeps, "she is late;" the larkspur listens, "i hear, i hear;" and the lily whispers, "i wait."  she is coming, my own, my sweet; were it ever so airy a tread, my heart would hear her and beat, were it earth in an earthy bed; my dust would hear her and beat, had i lain for a century dead, would start and tremble under her feet, and blossom in purple and red.

 in the warmth of night i put feet to my plan: waited for my brothers to sleep. they’d spent the day sharpening their hooks, repairing the great net, filling gourds with fresh water. they’d bundled taro wrapped in leaves sitting below the cross seats. the bundles and the net would cover me, especially if i said the chant to slow my movement and my breathing. the moon became brighter like a big fish eye as the chant hooked me.  i was holding my grandmother’s hook so tightly a little cut welled red between my closed knuckles. “goodmorning, brothers,” i called and they cussed and moaned until the next chant took us a further hundred miles and then another until my chanting made them gasp as we settled on a patch of ocean black with fish. they forgave me, not that it matters. i took the bloody hook and said my business to the ocean. it worked. the fish rose and our descent was secured.

 across the road from where we nap under a dead elm dazzles the meadow where the partisans strung the traitors up,  the meadow which their dangling shadows stain. belly up in vines a blasted tank rusts flake by flake to lichened scrap iron  while horseflies harangue the rippling green, july a limbo of quavering yellow...  we wake to cattle lowing at dawn, grass overgrowing summer—so like us in love each hour with the noonday sun  that neither toils nor spins, its brightness hovering, blinding us... what would the dead say if they could see us,  lounging, talking, peering through brambles at cemetery photographs sunk beneath the undertow of milkweed shadows,  death dates smoothing back into the stone? i think of goya’s demon, old man flesh hanging from his bones, long teeth bared in  an ass’s grin as he scrawls on a schoolboy’s slate, what more can be done? nothing...  while behind him a noose etched clean as  the moon rises through the inkblot spiraling back into the hanged man’s mouth as if blackness poured from his throat:  “when will you tire of us bogeymen, caricatures of your father’s war, our crimes half-forgotten, unforgiven?  all future blotted out when they hauled us from our beds, our minds went dead to everything but fear: nightshirts  soaked in snowlight’s pall, we hunched in mud, each step loud, too loud beside the farmhouse wall, the seconds teetering till we drop...  what our betrayals were we know with a knowledge intimate beyond revenge, history the needle’s eye you can’t squeeze through.  the partisans cut us down, heaped us in a mass grave our relatives dug up: yes, there were tears—even for us...  now, like aliens from space on your tv shows, we ravel into mist, surrounding you the moment your eyes close...  our pupils search out yours from behind the mirror with your father’s stares, fathers and sons melding in one mind—  but who are you to call us traitors, an outsider judging through the smoke-haze of home: each blow exact, our own neighbors  beat us till the blood ran, beat us black and blue...even now, would they dare take us back, older, wiser, necks broken by the yoke?  moving in time as to a dance we buzz and swarm across the meadow, dissolving and glinting like fireflies in the hedge,  blown like milkweed in the moon’s wall eye. but under your lids, you see us locked in cold, shattered wheatstraw flecked in ice:  chill as the night air on your sunburned neck our eyes like x rays pierce the frost, stalking every step the living take.”

 what links are ours with orbs that are so resolutely far: the solitary asks, and they give radiance as from a shield: still at the death of day, the seen, the unrevealed. implacable they shine to us who would of life obtain an answer for the life we strain to nourish with one sign. nor can imagination throw the penetrative shaft: we pass the breath of thought, who would divine if haply they may grow as earth; have our desire to know; if life comes there to grain from grass, and flowers like ours of toil and pain; has passion to beat bar, win space from cleaving brain; the mystic link attain, whereby star holds on star.  those visible immortals beam allurement to the dream: ireful at human hungers brook no question in the look. for ever virgin to our sense, remote they wane to gaze intense: prolong it, and in ruthlessness they smite the beating heart behind the ball of sight: till we conceive their heavens hoar, those lights they raise but sparkles frore, and earth, our blood-warm earth, a shuddering prey to that frigidity of brainless ray. yet space is given for breath of thought beyond our bounds when musing: more when to that musing love is brought, and love is asked of love's wherefore. 'tis earth's, her gift; else have we nought: her gift, her secret, here our tie. and not with her and yonder sky? bethink you: were it earth alone breeds love, would not her region be the sole delight and throne of generous deity?  to deeper than this ball of sight appeal the lustrous people of the night. fronting yon shoreless, sown with fiery sails, it is our ravenous that quails, flesh by its craven thirsts and fears distraught. the spirit leaps alight, doubts not in them is he, the binder of his sheaves, the sane, the right: of magnitude to magnitude is wrought, to feel it large of the great life they hold: in them to come, or vaster intervolved, the issues known in us, our unsolved solved: that there with toil life climbs the self-same tree, whose roots enrichment have from ripeness dropped. so may we read and little find them cold: let it but be the lord of mind to guide our eyes; no branch of reason's growing lopped; nor dreaming on a dream; but fortified by day to penetrate black midnight; see, hear, feel, outside the senses; even that we, the specks of dust upon a mound of mould, we who reflect those rays, though low our place, to them are lastingly allied.  so may we read, and little find them cold: not frosty lamps illumining dead space, not distant aliens, not senseless powers. the fire is in them whereof we are born; the music of their motion may be ours. spirit shall deem them beckoning earth and voiced sisterly to her, in her beams rejoiced. of love, the grand impulsion, we behold the love that lends her grace among the starry fold. then at new flood of customary morn, look at her through her showers, her mists, her streaming gold, a wonder edges the familiar face: she wears no more that robe of printed hours; half strange seems earth, and sweeter than her flowers.  
NEW POEM
 i  the grey sea and the long black land; and the yellow half-moon large and low; and the startled little waves that leap in fiery ringlets from their sleep, as i gain the cove with pushing prow, and quench its speed i' the slushy sand.  ii  then a mile of warm sea-scented beach; three fields to cross till a farm appears; a tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch and blue spurt of a lighted match, and a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears, than the two hearts beating each to each!  
NEW POEM
 on the radio this morning: the average woman knows 275 colors—and men know eight. women say coffee, mocha, copper, cinnamon, taupe . men say brown.  women know an amazon of colors i might have said were green, an antarctica of whites, oceans of colors i'd stupidly call blue, fields of color, with flowers in them i would have said were red.  from women, i've learned to love the browns, the earths, the dusts, the clays, the soft colors, the colors brought out from the mines, hardened ones, hardened in fires i would call red; the colors of the furies; the reconciling colors of the cooling ash.  by myself i know the evening colors when the sky goes from blue to another blue to black—although it's a lonely, whitish black sometimes, like the color of sleep— the way dreams are lit by the light that's thrown from nowhere on the things you find in them. last night there was a turtle, i would say it was brown or green, or it was a snake, mottled, a kind of grey, disguised as a turtle, red spots as if painted on the shell, a palish greenish underside—vulnerable, alone swimming in water i would say was colorless.  i woke to the pale colors of the morning—no one has a name for those: the white-rose white you see through the white of the curtains on the window, the milks, the creams, the cream a galactic swirl before it turns to brown when your wife stirs it in the coffee, the faint drying oval on the silver of the spoon.  
NEW POEM
 god made everything out of nothing; but the nothing shows through —paul valéry lost from all angles but the sun’s, this woken morning, it clicks its brilliance into place at once, if you follow the fall of light— a spider web, head-high, adorning the woodshed’s entrance like a sheet of gold-shot fabric, metal-tight, that, even so, one handswipe could delete, collapsing all that spacious architecture to a tacky ball.  it brings to mind the mathematician’s monstrous idea, the menger sponge, where infinite excisions out of a solid cube delete its substance while its form stays clear: the central ninth is cut from a square; eight smaller squares remain; repeat for each; and so on with this lattice of air: a formula for zero volume, infinite surface area.  enough. the estuary’s slung like gold-shot cloth over a gulf of shifting airs. among cloud-drifts of beaten eggwhite floats, as though confected of such froth, the mountain. like a chinese screen, the fabric of the view devotes almost all blankness to this hanging scene, this one handsweep of water, creased like the cheek of someone roused from sleep.  
NEW POEM
 i   king of the perennial holly-groves, the riven sandstone: overlord of the m5: architect of the historic rampart and ditch, the citadel at tamworth, the summer hermitage in holy cross: guardian of the welsh bridge and the iron bridge: contractor to the desirable new estates: saltmaster: moneychanger: commissioner for oaths: martyrologist: the friend of charlemagne.  ‘i liked that,’ said offa, ‘sing it again.’   iv   i was invested in mother-earth, the crypt of roots and endings. child’s-play. i abode there, bided my time: where the mole  shouldered the clogged wheel, his gold solidus; where dry-dust badgers thronged the roman flues, the long-unlooked-for mansions of our tribe.   v   so much for the elves’ wergild, the true governance of england, the gaunt warrior-gospel armoured in engraved stone. i wormed my way heavenward for ages amid barbaric ivy, scrollwork of fern.  exile or pilgrim set me once more upon that ground: my rich and desolate childhood. dreamy, smug-faced, sick on outings—i who was taken to be a king of some kind, a prodigy, a maimed one.   vi   the princes of mercia were badger and raven. thrall to their freedom, i dug and hoarded. orchards fruited above clefts. i drank from honeycombs of chill sandstone.  ‘a boy at odds in the house, lonely among brothers.’ but i, who had none, fostered a strangeness; gave myself to unattainable toys.  candles of gnarled resin, apple-branches, the tacky mistletoe. ‘look’ they said and again ‘look.’ but i ran slowly; the landscape flowed away, back to its source.  in the schoolyard, in the cloakrooms, the children boasted their scars of dried snot; wrists and knees garnished with impetigo.   x   he adored the desk, its brown-oak inlaid with ebony, assorted prize pens, the seals of gold and base metal into which he had sunk his name.  it was there that he drew upon grievances from the people; attended to signatures and retributions; forgave the death-howls of his rival. and there he exchanged gifts with the muse of history.  what should a man make of remorse, that it might profit his soul? tell me. tell everything to mother, darling, and god bless.  he swayed in sunlight, in mild dreams. he tested the little pears. he smeared catmint on his palm for his cat smut to lick. he wept, attempting to master ancilla and servus.   xi   coins handsome as nero’s; of good substance and weight.offa rex resonant in silver, and the names of his moneyers. they struck with accountable tact. they could alter the king’s face.  exactness of design was to deter imitation; mutilation if that failed. exemplary metal, ripe for commerce. value from a sparse people, scrapers of salt-pans and byres.  swathed bodies in the long ditch; one eye upstaring. it is safe to presume, here, the king’s anger. he reigned forty years. seasons touched and retouched the soil.  heathland, new-made watermeadow. charlock, marsh-marigold. crepitant oak forest where the boar furrowed black mould, his snout intimate with worms and leaves.   xv   tutting, he wrenched at a snarled root of dead crabapple. it rose against him. in brief cavort he was cernunnos, the branched god, lightly concussed.  he divided his realm. it lay there like a dream. an ancient land, full of strategy. ramparts of compost pioneered by red-helmeted worms. hemlock in ambush, night-soil, tetanus. a wasps’ nest ensconced in the hedge-bank, a reliquary or wrapped head, the corpse of cernunnos pitching dayward its feral horns.   xvi   clash of salutation. as keels thrust into shingle. ambassadors, pilgrims. what is carried over? the frankish gift, two-edged, regaled with slaughter.  the sword is in the king’s hands; the crux a craftsman’s triumph. metal effusing its own fragrance, a variety of balm. and other miracles, other exchanges.  shafts from the winter sun homing upon earth’s rim. christ’s mass: in the thick of a snowy forest the flickering evergreen fissured with light.  attributes assumed, retribution entertained. what is borne amongst them? too much or too little. indulgences of bartered acclaim; an expenditure, a hissing. wine, urine and ashes.   xxvii   ‘now when king offa was alive and dead’, they were all there, the funereal gleemen: papal legate and rural dean; merovingian car-dealers, welsh mercenaries; a shuffle of house-carls.  he was defunct. they were perfunctory. the ceremony stood acclaimed. the mob received memorial vouchers and signs.  after that shadowy, thrashing midsummer hail-storm, earth lay for a while, the ghost-bride of livid thor, butcher of strawberries, and the shire-tree dripped red in the arena of its uprooting.   xxx   and it seemed, while we waited, he began to walk towards us             he vanished  he left behind coins, for his lodging, and traces of red mud.

 how to explain brazil to an extraterrestrial: your face on a flag. they’d recognize you as leader and knock you off. dirty part of the conquest. but it already happened, in another shape: aerial view of the amazon, a hundred-odd hydroelectric plants to fry your eggs in the microwave. and they’d finish you off: just part of the conquest. and what if they came to tour the waterfalls? or to be taught by the elite how to make a democracy? the spaceships cover the sky completely. all the offices and fast food joints declare an end to the working day. cockroaches and rats fled first. it’s christmas, carnival, easter, our lady of aparecida, and the final judgment all at once. lovers fuck for the last time. atms dry heave. the supermarket was a cemetery! the malls, the freeways! to explain civil unions to an iguana, to explain political alliances to a cat, to explain climate change to an aquarium turtle. it’s done, already. now, wait. eat an activia. dwell in philosophy. imagine! in our tropical country ... disastrous! not one river more. tragic! worse than locusts, your marvelous hydroelectric plants will be seen, in flames, from sirius: “my country was a sweet corn pamonha that a starving alien put in the microwave.” watch us burn: possible epitaph.    translated from the portuguese  
NEW POEM
 red-wigglers, night-crawlers &amp; other worms look out into the crapulous moonlight:  figures of women cascading through the sunday night;  no beer in sight.  i remember the night-blooming cereus by dr. thornton, engraver, blake’s patron, it hangs in the hall outside the bedroom swaying hungrily like these giant white goddesses of the dark grotto…  there are touring cars and men with large guns singing through the woods  behind us.    
NEW POEM
 on nights like this we used to swim in the quarry, the boys making up games requiring them to tear off  the girls’ clothes and the girls cooperating, because they had new bodies since last summer and they wanted to exhibit them, the brave ones leaping off  the high rocks — bodies crowding the water.  the nights were humid, still. the stone was cool and wet, marble for  graveyards, for buildings that we never saw, buildings in cities far away.  on cloudy nights, you were blind. those nights the rocks were dangerous, but in another way it was all dangerous, that was what we were after. the summer started. then the boys and girls began to pair off but always there were a few left at the end — sometimes they’d keep watch, sometimes they’d pretend to go off  with each other like the rest, but what could they do there, in the woods? no one wanted to be them. but they’d show up anyway, as though some night their luck would change, fate would be a different fate.  at the beginning and at the end, though, we were all together. after the evening chores, after the smaller children were in bed, then we were free. nobody said anything, but we knew the nights we’d meet and the nights we wouldn’t. once or twice, at the end of summer, we could see a baby was going to come out of all that kissing.  and for those two, it was terrible, as terrible as being alone. the game was over. we’d sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes, worrying about the ones who weren’t there.  and then finally walk home through the fields, because there was always work the next day. and the next day, we were kids again, sitting on the front steps in the morning, eating a peach.  just that, but it seemed an honor to have a mouth. and then going to work, which meant helping out in the fields. one boy worked for an old lady, building shelves. the house was very old, maybe built when the mountain was built.  and then the day faded. we were dreaming, waiting for night. standing at the front door at twilight, watching the shadows lengthen. and a voice in the kitchen was always complaining about the heat, wanting the heat to break.  then the heat broke, the night was clear. and you thought of  the boy or girl you’d be meeting later. and you thought of  walking into the woods and lying down, practicing all those things you were learning in the water. and though sometimes you couldn’t see the person you were with, there was no substitute for that person.  the summer night glowed; in the field, fireflies were glinting. and for those who understood such things, the stars were sending messages: you will leave the village where you were born and in another country you’ll become very rich, very powerful, but always you will mourn something you left behind, even though you can’t say what it was, and eventually you will return to seek it.  
NEW POEM
 at dusk, a great flare of winter lightning photographed the bay: waves were broken scrolls.          beyond donegal, white mountains hung in a narrow bas-relief frozen on sky.  later, there was sleet: trees down on the drumholm road; near timoney’s farm, a frantic goose pinned under branches.  all night long, we spoke of loneliness, long winter, while winter sang in the chimneys.  then the sky cleared and a marvel began: the hills turned blue; in the valley a blue cottage sent up the day’s first plume of smoke. it gathered like a dream drenched in frost.  that should have been all.                           we had worn out night.  but single-file,  deliberate,  five heifers,  a black bull,  three calves stepped  through the broken fence. they arranged themselves between the house and hedge: a kind of diagram: a shifting pattern grazing frozen weeds.  their image is with me still.               the backs of the cattle are patchy with frost blue as morning.  
NEW POEM
 he has no gift for friendship, for he is void of all curiosity. or rather, he’s only interested in matters touching the lord hamlet himself.  he was born in a lab whose walls were lined with giant, steamy jars of the milk of the various mammals, from the milk of camels to the milk of men.  pig milk, monkey milk, rat milk. dog and cat milk, and the milk of whales. the milk of the duck-billed platypus and that | of the platitudinous buck.  the thick red milk of the vampire bat. and the black milk of the black bear. —a backlit wall of bottles, ranged from commonplace to rare!—  there was stallion milk and rooster, anaconda milk and shark; there was tarantula milk, venus flytrap, and that | of the barking aardvark lark.  and he would have been perfectly normal, would have grown up socially adroit, but he stripped the sheet off a drinking straw, took a blade, and shaped a point;—  and he syringed into his body a few drops from every jar, fell in the floor and spoke languages he had never heard before.  he spoke titmouse. he spoke miaow. he spoke moo and gnu and ha. he spoke three kinds of chickenhawk and the thirty dialects of baa.  and from that day to this, mardud’s been lost in the zoo: a cautionary tale for whoever knows how to read the clues.  
NEW POEM
 the miller's wife had waited long, the tea was cold, the fire was dead; and there might yet be nothing wrong in how he went and what he said: "there are no millers any more," was all that she had heard him say; and he had lingered at the door so long that it seemed yesterday.  sick with a fear that had no form she knew that she was there at last; and in the mill there was a warm and mealy fragrance of the past. what else there was would only seem to say again what he had meant; and what was hanging from a beam would not have heeded where she went.  and if she thought it followed her, she may have reasoned in the dark that one way of the few there were would hide her and would leave no mark: black water, smooth above the weir like starry velvet in the night, though ruffled once, would soon appear the same as ever to the sight.  
NEW POEM
 when the mink ran across the meadow in bunched black parabolas, i thought sine and cosine, but no — the movement never dips below the line. the creature vanished into barberries. absolute predator who cracks a rabbit’s spine in one bite. and my mind  leapt along a track to a summer field where i walked years ago to a stony spit out into the north atlantic with a young man i hardly knew, and his sister. he was bald, dying of a brain tumor. i ignored his illness and we spoke of history. he was gentle, scholarly. why  do i remember him when it was his sister i painted seated in tall grass, her forehead wide, brown hair framing her face, ocean a cobalt swatch behind? islands humped in little arcs across the bay. that canvas is stacked in a closet. but it’s the dead boy i’ve stored inside me all these years,  scared of the otherworldly light around his eyes. scared and ashamed of what i didn’t know. ashamed of my fear that made his death, when it came, unspeakable. so history bounds into the present, glitter-eyed, with musky anal glands and daggering eyeteeth. because that boy wasn’t dead: he must be killed again.  
NEW POEM
 in the backyard of our house on norwood, there were five hundred steel cages lined up, each with a wooden box roofed with tar paper; inside, two stories, with straw for a bed. sometimes the minks would pace back and forth wildly, looking for a way out; or else they’d hide in their wooden houses, even when we’d put the offering of raw horse meat on their trays, as if they knew they were beautiful and wanted to deprive us. in spring the placid kits drank with glazed eyes. sometimes the mothers would go mad and snap their necks. my uncle would lift the roof like a god who might lift our roof, look down on us and take us out to safety. sometimes one would escape. he would go down on his hands and knees, aiming a flashlight like a bullet of light, hoping to catch the orange gold of its eyes. he wore huge boots, gloves so thick their little teeth couldn’t bite through. “they’re wild,” he’d say. “never trust them.” each afternoon when i put the scoop of raw meat rich with eggs and vitamins on their trays, i’d call to each a greeting. their small thin faces would follow as if slightly curious. in fall they went out in a van, returning sorted, matched, their skins hanging down on huge metal hangers, pinned by their mouths. my uncle would take them out when company came and drape them over his arm—the sweetest cargo. he’d blow down the pelts softly and the hairs would part for his breath and show the shining underlife which, like the shining of the soul, gives us each character and beauty.

 i.  dusk, thus: a shirt drops,  the bellybutton rune showing.  clouds are soaked, the sea now  iron, muscle-heavy. the pond begins  reflecting on astronomy. the fruit wait.  the furniture call back their atoms.  the tree asks for its leaves.   ii.  winter brought into the room is the whisk of holly.  the purse is a hare limp on the table, its eye gone amber.  the birdcage is the work i am after: bold-barred, so no bird leaves.  the celadon throat, the iceberg teeth, the matted grass of an armpit . . .  a pear, or maybe a stone, the chilled shoulder shifts under cover, not persuaded into similitude.   iii.  in the snail-tracked sky, the mineral grains, a dozen eyes.  you tell me thread is for seam and hem, not the mica bead-stitched on the dark.  you refuse to have the shards the broom gathered be the moon, seen as aftermath.  but like the thimble, i have no guile.  so let your window open to the rain coming down, drumming on the hidden shells.   iv.  black cherries. glass of milk on a tablecloth. an arm of bread.  the coins. green scarab beetle. the compact’s sleeping mirror.  the fig branch. the sundial. the harlequin leaves.   v.  votive-light evening, cipher ridden.  the marsh air, and my finger in places.  among the lesser constellations, the fractured  kite, the anemone. the geese thread-pulled  into the hard sleep. the clothespin, the gold  in your hair. the seeds spread  are a flung field. i sleep on stone, you on moss.   vi.  the red-haired figure in the station, the man selling carnations. the scarecrow  landscape, the suitcases getting heavier with every stop. those served as props.  i dreamed we each played a part.  one of us was given to say: i wanted your distance whispered down small enough for this room.  and one to say: i saw you always just a little out of reach, with white hair.   vii.  a fish-scale moon: who doesn’t want  to be left used windsock-hollow?  now for morning: the lit wick  of each grass-blade, the saplings  like legs of deer, the four walls  verifying the house, and the slip  of last night’s chive in your teeth.  
NEW POEM
 the stars grow lemon in the field, spread like tea leaves in a cup; red-wing blackbirds fold themselves into the fence, corn dreamers.  the sky undulating with clouds returns gold-throated arpeggios to the one walking at sunrise, sunfall.  light as the air i sit on my cottage steps; a tom cat come home to die for the day.

 it’s autumn in the country i remember.  how warm a wind blew here about the ways! and shadows on the hillside lay to slumber during the long sun-sweetened summer-days.  it’s cold abroad the country i remember.  the swallows veering skimmed the golden grain at midday with a wing aslant and limber; and yellow cattle browsed upon the plain.  it’s empty down the country i remember.  i had a sister lovely in my sight: her hair was dark, her eyes were very sombre; we sang together in the woods at night.  it’s lonely in the country i remember.  the babble of our children fills my ears, and on our hearth i stare the perished ember to flames that show all starry thro’ my tears.  it’s dark about the country i remember.  there are the mountains where i lived. the path is slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber, the stumps are twisted by the tempests’ wrath.  but that i knew these places are my own, i’d ask how came such wretchedness to cumber the earth, and i to people it alone.  it rains across the country i remember.

NEW POEM
 i never glimpse her but she goes who had been basking in the sun, her links of chain mail one by one aglint with pewter, bronze and rose.  i never see her lying coiled atop the garden step, or under a dark leaf, unless i blunder and by some motion she is foiled.  too late i notice as she passes zither of chromatic scale— i only ever see her tail quicksilver into tall grasses.  i know her only by her flowing, by her glamour disappearing into shadow as i’m nearing— i only recognize her going.  
NEW POEM
 momus is the name men give your face, the brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle finding a way mid mist on a shoreland, where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray against horizons purple, silent.  yes, momus, men have flung your face in bronze to gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk. they were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth, gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom; all your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by god.  i wonder, momus, whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter on men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history. a droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze, you give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent; granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves, careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears, and blood drops of undiminishing war.

 the eyelids glowing, some chill morning. o world half-known through opening, twilit lids before the vague face clenches into light; o universal waters like a cloud, like those first clouds of half-created matter; o all things rising, rising like the fumes from waters falling, o forever falling; infinite, the skeletal shells that fall, relinquished, the snowsoft sift of the diatoms, like selves downdrifting age upon age through milky oceans; o slow downdrifting of the atoms; o island nebulae and o the nebulous islands wandering these mists like falsefires, which are true, bobbing like milkweed, like warm lanterns bobbing through the snowfilled windless air, blinking and passing as we pass into the memory of women who are passing. within those depths what ravening? what devouring rage? how shall our living know its ends of yielding? these things have taken me as the mouth an orange— that acrid sweet juice entering every cell; and i am shared out. i become these things: these lilies, if these things are water lilies which are dancers growing dim across no floor; these mayflies; whirled dust orbiting in the sun; this blossoming diffused as rushlights; galactic vapors; fluorescence into which we pass and penetrate; o soft as the thighs of women; o radiance, into which i go on dying ...

 some years ago a procession of men calling themselves the sky-clad came to this district to build a hospital for birds that had been damaged by the rains.  the landholders here my grandfather among them decided against it— it not being our way to intervene with monsoons  which is why to this day the birds here grow so damaged &amp; wise,  or so our tutor said gravely  before stepping out into the sun- washed coriander patch to watch droplets work down stems one by one, small storms suspended, while over the rooftiles came breakers of mist making our whole house to him drift back like the high prow of the viceroy’s steamship he watched sail off with his youth.  inside i still could not find the main verb the chariot wheel performed. i thought  it was silver. it bore  the king with 100 heads across a battlefield red with his wounded up to the end of the beginner’s workbook  then blue-skinned rama bent his bow then his raider’s arrow met the axle &amp; then  i could not stop laughing  as through the doorway my mother scolded the aphasic houseboy  who peed into our green watertank (black putti, untouchable) arcing the thin golden stream &amp; singing ooo-ee ooo-ee at our ruin.

 i was so worried the hickory i recognized had died from salt burn in the last hurricane i may have passed by vervain and apple haw like they didn’t matter, but this spring it put out seven shoots from its base. still, the oldest trick is the moon missing, then the “new” moon appears, though we know it’s the old one, and we pretend to be taken in like the mother or baby behind the bath towel. really it’s the moon winking, being the stone that holds stones and now footprints. and when i tell frances, i see she is a moon motionless in the doorway, skin reflecting a lamp, a face that awakens on paper.

 (1942)  to denis devlin i   again the native hour lets down the locks uncombed and black, but gray the bobbing beard; ten years ago his eyes, fierce shuttlecocks, pierced the close net of what i failed: i feared the belly-cold, the grave-clout, that betrayed me dithering in the drift of cordial seas; ten years are time enough to be dismayed by mummy christ, head crammed between his knees.  suppose i take an arrogant bomber, stroke by stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear sun-ghostlings whisper: yes, the capital yoke— remove it and there’s not a ghost to fear this crucial day, whose decapitate joke languidly winds into the inner ear.   ii   the day’s at end and there’s nowhere to go, draw to the fire, even this fire is dying; get up and once again politely lying invite the ladies toward the mistletoe with greedy eyes that stare like an old crow. how pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang and how stuffed santa did his reindeer clang above the golden oaken mantel, years ago!   then hang this picture for a calendar, as sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly for the cold martial progress of your star, with thoughts of commerce and society, well-milked chinese, negroes who cannot sing, the huns gelded and feeding in a ring.   iii   give me this day a faith not personal as follows: the american people fully armed with assurance policies, righteous and harmed, battle the world of which they’re not at all. that lying boy of ten who stood in the hall, his hat in hand (thus by his father charmed: “you may be president”), was not alarmed nor even left uneasy by his fall.   nobody said that he could be a plumber, carpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier; let little boys go into violent slumber, aegean squall and squalor where their fear is of an enemy in remote oceans unstalked by christ: these are the better notions.   iv   gay citizen, myself, and thoughtful friend, your ghosts are plato’s christians in the cave. unfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave gives back the cheated and light dividend so long sequestered; now, new-rich, you’ll spend flesh for reality inside a stone whose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone, dead or still living, will not break or bend.   thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister and put off like a dog that’s had his day, you will be plato’s kept philosopher, albino man bleached from the mortal clay, mild-mannered, gifted in your master’s ease while the sun squats upon the waveless seas.

 ye living lamps, by whose dear light the nightingale does sit so late, and studying all the summer night, her matchless songs does meditate;  ye country comets, that portend no war nor prince’s funeral, shining unto no higher end than to presage the grass’s fall;  ye glow-worms, whose officious flame to wand’ring mowers shows the way, that in the night have lost their aim, and after foolish fires do stray;  your courteous lights in vain you waste, since juliana here is come, for she my mind hath so displac’d that i shall never find my home.  
NEW POEM
 amid the iris and the rose, the honeysuckle and the bay, the wild earth for a moment goes in dust or weed another way.  small though its corner be, the weed will yet intrude its creeping beard; the harsh blade and the hairy seed recall the brutal earth we feared.  and if no water touch the dust in some far corner, and one dare to breathe upon it, one may trust the spectre on the summer air:  the risen dust alive with fire, the fire made visible, a blur interrate, the pervasive ire of foxtail and of hoarhound burr.

 there is a brand of play called muteness beneath the play yard’s interlacing branches.  it appeals to children born entre deux guerres, whose specialty it is.  it is mutiny; that is, a tongue of foreign origin ending in grunts.  one such child uses his tongue on a frozen fence for the embrace of it  for the mutating appendage makes of speech a combat; an internment.  there is a brand of child assisted to the play yard by his keeper fussing with his zipper.  yes, it is cold in the high hemisphere and nothing will be the death of him  as he sets hard sweets on his tongue he neither chews nor swallows.  such children can never swing too freely from the elm’s loping barkless arm.  it is mutual. there is smoke on the air, tarry, commuting the industry on high  as the children simmer within their word-cloud.  and someone or something is calling them home a familiar voice, if they have one.

 i do not understand the poets who tell me that i should not personify. every morning the willow auditions for a new role  outside my bedroom window—today she is clytemnestra; yesterday a southern belle, lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts.  nor do i like the mathematicians who tell me i cannot say, "the zinnias are counting on their fingers," or "the dog is practicing her geometry,"  even though every day i watch her using the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle from which she bisects the circumference  of the lawn until she finds the place where the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped the ante by climbing into a new euclidian plane.  she stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention,  her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping, yes, even over themselves, until i go out to assist, by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, "there!  there!" but instead of following my outstretched arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is now lounging under a canopy of leaves,  catching its breath, charting its next escape, she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips, confident that i—who can bring her home  from across the field with a word, who can speak for the willow and the zinnia— can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.

 1.  we like to think of it as parallel to what we know, only bigger. one man against the authorities. or one man against a city of zombies. one man  who is not, in fact, a man, sent to understand the caravan of men now chasing him like red ants let loose down the pants of america. man on the run.  man with a ship to catch, a payload to drop, this message going out to all of space.. . . though maybe it’s more like life below the sea: silent,  buoyant, bizarrely benign. relics of an outmoded design. some like to imagine a cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars,  mouthing yes,yes as we toddle toward the light, biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge. longing to sweep us to her breast, she hopes for the best  while the father storms through adjacent rooms ranting with the force of kingdom come, not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw.  sometimes,  what i see is a library in a rural community. all the tall shelves in the big open room. and the pencils in a cup at circulation, gnawed on by the entire population.  the books have lived here all along, belonging for weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence of family names, speaking (at night mostly) to a face,  a pair of eyes. the most remarkable lies.   2.  charlton heston is waiting to be let in. he asked once politely. a second time with force from the diaphragm. the third time, he did it like moses: arms raised high, face an apocryphal white.  shirt crisp, suit trim, he stoops a little coming in, then grows tall. he scans the room. he stands until i gesture, then he sits. birds commence their evening chatter. someone fires  charcoals out below. he’ll take a whiskey if i have it. water if i don’t. i ask him to start from the beginning, but he goes only halfway back. that was the future once, he says.before the world went upside down.  hero, survivor, god’s right hand man, i know he sees the blank surface of the moon where i see a language built from brick and bone. he sits straight in his seat, takes a long, slow high-thespian breath,  then lets it go.for all i know, i was the last true man on this earth. and: may i smoke? the voices outside soften. planes jet past heading off or back. someone cries that she does not want to go to bed. footsteps overhead.  a fountain in the neighbor’s yard babbles to itself, and the night air lifts the sound indoors.it was another time, he says, picking up again. we were pioneers. will you fight to stay alive here, riding the earth  toward god-knows-where? i think of atlantis buried under ice, gone one day from sight, the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark. our eyes adjust to the dark.   3.  perhaps the great error is believing we’re alone,  that the others have come and gone—a momentary blip—  when all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,  bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel  nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,  setting solid feet down on planets everywhere,  bowing to the great stars that command, pitching stones  at whatever are their moons. they live wondering  if they are the only ones, knowing only the wish to know,  and the great black distance they—we—flicker in.   maybe the dead know, their eyes widening at last,  seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on  at twilight. hearing the engines flare, the horns  not letting up, the frenzy of being. i want to be  one notch below bedlam, like a radio without a dial.  wide open, so everything floods in at once.  and sealed tight, so nothing escapes. not even time,  which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.  so that i might be sitting now beside my father  as he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe  for the first time in the winter of 1959.  4.  in those last scenes of kubrick’s 2001 when dave is whisked into the center of space, which unfurls in an aurora of orgasmic light before opening wide, like a jungle orchid for a love-struck bee, then goes liquid, paint-in-water, and then gauze wafting out and off, before, finally, the night tide, luminescent and vague, swirls in, and on and on. . . .  in those last scenes, as he floats above jupiter’s vast canyons and seas, over the lava strewn plains and mountains packed in ice, that whole time, he doesn’t blink. in his little ship, blind to what he rides, whisked across the wide-screen of unparcelled time, who knows what blazes through his mind? is it still his life he moves through, or does that end at the end of what he can name?  on set, it’s shot after shot till kubrick is happy, then the costumes go back on their racks and the great gleaming set goes black.   5.  when my father worked on the hubble telescope, he said they operated like surgeons: scrubbed and sheathed in papery green, the room a clean cold, a bright white.  he’d read larry niven at home, and drink scotch on the rocks, his eyes exhausted and pink. these were the reagan years, when we lived with our finger on the button and struggled  to view our enemies as children. my father spent whole seasons bowing before the oracle-eye, hungry for what it would find. his face lit-up whenever anyone asked, and his arms would rise  as if he were weightless, perfectly at ease in the never-ending night of space. on the ground, we tied postcards to balloons for peace. prince charles married lady di. rock hudson died.  we learned new words for things. the decade changed.  the first few pictures came back blurred, and i felt ashamed for all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. the second time, the optics jibed. we saw to the edge of all there is—  so brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back.

 a name trimmed they    are   seated   in    the   shadows with colored husking   corn, shelling   peas. houses ribbons of wood set in the   ground.   i try to find the spot at which the pattern on the   floor   repeats.   pink,   and rosy, quartz. they   wade   in brackish water. the    leaves    outside    the window tricked the eye, demanding that one see them, focus on them, making it impossible to   look   past   them, and though holes were opened through the foliage, they were as useless as port- holes underwater looking into a dark sea, which only reflects the room one seeks to look out from. sometimes into benevolent and other times into ghastly shapes. it speaks of a few of the rather terrible blind. i grew stubborn until blue as the eyes overlooking the bay from the bridge scattered over its bowls through a fading light and backed by the protest of the bright breathless west. each bit of jello had been molded in tiny doll dishes, each trembling orange bit a different shape, but all otherwise the same. i am urged out rummaging into the sunshine, and the depths increase of blue above. a paper hat afloat on a cone of water. the orange and gray bugs were linked from their mating but faced in opposite directions, and their scrambling amounted to nothing. this simply means that the imagination is more restless than the body. but, already, words. can there be laughter without comparisons. the tongue lisps in its hilarious panic. if, for ex- ample, you say, “i always prefer being by myself,”   and, then, one afternoon, you want to telephone a friend, maybe you feel you have betrayed your ideals. we have poured into the sink the stale water in which the iris died. life is hopelessly frayed, all loose ends. a pansy suddenly, a web, a trail remarkably’s a snail’s. it was an enormous egg, sitting in the vineyard—an enormous rock-shaped egg. on that still day my grandmother raked up the leaves beside a particular pelargonium. with a name like that there is a lot you can do. children are not always inclined to choose such paths. you can tell by the eucalyptus tree, its shaggy branches scatter buttons. in the afternoons, when the shades were pulled for my nap, the light coming through was of a dark yellow, near- ly orange, melancholy, as heavy as honey, and it made me thirsty. that doesn’t say it all, nor even a greater part. yet it seems even more incomplete when we were there in person. half the day in half the room. the wool makes one itch and the scratching makes one warm. but herself that she obeyed she dressed. it talks. the baby is scrubbed everywhere, he is an apple. they are true kitchen stalwarts. the smell of breathing fish and breathing shells seems sad, a mystery, rap- turous, then dead. a self-centered being, in this different world. a urinating doll, half-buried in sand. she is lying on her stomach with one eye closed, driving a toy truck along the road she has cleared with her fingers. i mean untroubled by the distortions. that was the fashion when she was a young woman and famed for her beauty, surrounded by beaux. once it was circular and that shape can still be seen from the air. protected by the dog. protected by foghorns, frog honks, cricket circles on the brown hills. it was a message of happiness by which we were called into the room, as if to receive a birthday present given early, because it was too large to hide, or alive, a pony perhaps, his mane trimmed with colored ribbons.

 she fell asleep on christmas eve: at length the long-ungranted shade of weary eyelids overweigh'd the pain nought else might yet relieve.  our mother, who had lean'd all day over the bed from chime to chime, then rais'd herself for the first time, and as she sat her down, did pray.  her little work-table was spread with work to finish. for the glare made by her candle, she had care to work some distance from the bed.  without, there was a cold moon up, of winter radiance sheer and thin; the hollow halo it was in was like an icy crystal cup.  through the small room, with subtle sound of flame, by vents the fireshine drove and redden'd. in its dim alcove the mirror shed a clearness round.  i had been sitting up some nights, and my tired mind felt weak and blank; like a sharp strengthening wine it drank the stillness and the broken lights.  twelve struck. that sound, by dwindling years heard in each hour, crept off; and then the ruffled silence spread again, like water that a pebble stirs.  our mother rose from where she sat: her needles, as she laid them down, met lightly, and her silken gown settled: no other noise than that.  "glory unto the newly born!" so, as said angels, she did say; because we were in christmas day, though it would still be long till morn.  just then in the room over us there was a pushing back of chairs, as some who had sat unawares so late, now heard the hour, and rose.  with anxious softly-stepping haste our mother went where margaret lay, fearing the sounds o'erhead—should they have broken her long watch'd-for rest!  she stoop'd an instant, calm, and turn'd; but suddenly turn'd back again; and all her features seem'd in pain with woe, and her eyes gaz'd and yearn'd.  for my part, i but hid my face, and held my breath, and spoke no word: there was none spoken; but i heard the silence for a little space.  our mother bow'd herself and wept: and both my arms fell, and i said, "god knows i knew that she was dead." and there, all white, my sister slept.  then kneeling, upon christmas morn a little after twelve o'clock we said, ere the first quarter struck, "christ's blessing on the newly born!"

 it’s the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me, that drives us like lemmings, but cautiously— the search for a bright square cloud—the scent of lemon verbena— or to learn rules for the game the sea otters play in the surf.  it is these small things—and the secret behind them that fill the heart. the pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon that link them together and pull their freedom into our senses,  the smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals  —the rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled. it is these small things  that when brought into vision become an inferno.

 the day was mild, the light was generous. the german on the café terrace held a small book on his lap. i caught sight of the title: mysticism for beginners. suddenly i understood that the swallows patrolling the streets of montepulciano with their shrill whistles, and the hushed talk of timid travelers from eastern, so-called central europe, and the white herons standing—yesterday? the day before?— like nuns in fields of rice, and the dusk, slow and systematic, erasing the outlines of medieval houses, and olive trees on little hills, abandoned to the wind and heat, and the head of the unknown princess that i saw and admired in the louvre, and stained-glass windows like butterfly wings sprinkled with pollen, and the little nightingale practicing its speech beside the highway, and any journey, any kind of trip, are only mysticism for beginners, the elementary course, prelude to a test that's been postponed.

 if i had enough cages to keep all the birds i’ve collected over the years then i would have to open a shop because there’s only so much room in a two-bedroom walk-up for 48 birds, not to mention the dancing bears and the frogs, or the different varieties of fish, the one species of flea, and i almost forgot the proud dogs and the lone mule, the profane one who entered my life to curse at scribes and pharisees; and maybe he’d let the mouse i found forever dying at the end of a poem ride on his back like a whiskered christ and if not, maybe my yeti could do it when he’s not downtown working security at the store or teaching the parrots how to say brotherhood in grunt and how to comb out the tangles and mud from his hair whose sweat reminds me of that bearded collector of  beasts with the ark who would have no doubt understood how i feel, that prophet of change under whose spell i want to confess that i’m a christian of   the old testament, that my grandfather hung all his goats upside down, their throats over a bucket, and slapped their chests like that other nature boy who strutted around the ring like a peacock with his feathered hair that stayed immaculate even on the nights he lost to our hero wahoo mcdaniel who never played the heel, he who hailed from the lost tribes of oklahoma, who made us want to be chiefs so much we wore pigeon feathers and circled each other inside a green square of water hose until someone finally rang the bell that was never there and we sprung toward each other like animals in love or at war.

 i’ve known rivers: i’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.  my soul has grown deep like the rivers.  i bathed in the euphrates when dawns were young. i built my hut near the congo and it lulled me to sleep. i looked upon the nile and raised the pyramids above it. i heard the singing of the mississippi when abe lincoln went down to new orleans, and i’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.  i’ve known rivers: ancient, dusky rivers.  my soul has grown deep like the rivers.

 never the time and the place and the loved one all together! this path—how soft to pace! this may—what magic weather! where is the loved one's face? in a dream that loved one's face meets mine, but the house is narrow, the place is bleak where, outside, rain and wind combine with a furtive ear, if i strive to speak, with a hostile eye at my flushing cheek, with a malice that marks each word, each sign! o enemy sly and serpentine, uncoil thee from the waking man! do i hold the past thus firm and fast yet doubt if the future hold i can? this path so soft to pace shall lead thro' the magic of may to herself indeed! or narrow if needs the house must be, outside are the storms and strangers: we oh, close, safe, warm sleep i and she,— i and she!  
NEW POEM
 1 when the loons cry, the night seems blacker, the water deeper.  across the shore: an eyelash-charcoal fringe of pine trees.  2 the lake reflects indefinite pewter,  and intermittent thunder lets us know  the gods are arriving, one valley over.  3 after the long melancholy of the fall, one longs for the crisp brass shout of winter—  the blaze of firewood, the window’s spill of parlor lamplight across the snow.  4 flaring like a match dropped in a dry patch, one sunset tells the spectrum’s story.  see the last hunter’s flashlight dim as he hurries home to his lighted window.

NEW POEM
 blood-drop, lung of fire setting past the sea bell and wave; why am i separate from that giant burrowing into further life?  the body breathes and rides a heavy-netted ocean swollen by the tide. under the half-moon  it’s the lighthouse light that turns the rest of me to early nightfall, headland, home. i send it back,  a mirrored flickering across cold waters. we allow ourselves the crest that breaks above the surface then re-forms.  we make it human and we call it love. this wintering is my own and not the world’s, although the world is wintering.  
NEW POEM
 i woke to more rain, and felt in the dark for how wet the sill was, then rolled back to my radio, and a midnight preacher in my earphone teaching about sin.  i learned that punishment would come like lightning that surprises an innocent shore. thunder would follow me all my days, stern reminder and sharp rebuke.  the long, sleek, and pointed call that rose, as if in response, out of the estuary of night and storm, said it knew well what the given world gave, and wanted more.  
NEW POEM
 the moon has left the sky, love, the stars are hiding now, and frowning on the world, love, night bares her sable brow.  the snow is on the ground, love, and cold and keen the air is. i’m singing here to you, love; you’re dreaming there in paris.  but this is nature’s law, love, though just it may not seem, that men should wake to sing, love; while maidens sleep and dream.  them care may not molest, love, nor stir them from their slumbers, though midnight find the swain, love. still halting o’er his numbers.  i watch the rosy dawn, love, come stealing up the east, while all things round rejoice, love, that night her reign has ceased.  the lark will soon be heard, love, and on his way be winging; when nature’s poets, wake, love, why should a man be singing?  
NEW POEM
 the young bull dropped his head and stared. only a wispy wire—electrified—kept us apart. that, and two long rows of asparagus. an ancient apple tree blossomed prodigally pink and white.  the muddy path sucked at my shoe, but i reached the granite step, and knocked at the rickety porch door. deep in the house a dog began to bark. i had prepared my heart fund speech, and the first word—when—was on my tongue.  i heard no steps—only the breeze riffling the tender poplar leaves, and a random, meditative moo behind me. . . . relieved, i turned back to the car, passing once more under the bull’s judicial eye. . . . everything was intact: the canister, still far too light and mute, and metal boutonnières where they began— in a zip-lock plastic sandwich bag.  
NEW POEM
 a noiseless patient spider, i mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated, mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, it launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.  and you o my soul where you stand, surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them, till the bridge you will need be form’d, till the ductile anchor hold, till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, o my soul.  
NEW POEM
 i returned to a long strand, the hammered curve of a bay, and found only the secular powers of the atlantic thundering.  i faced the unmagical invitations of iceland, the pathetic colonies of greenland, and suddenly  those fabulous raiders, those lying in orkney and dublin measured against their long swords rusting,  those in the solid belly of stone ships, those hacked and glinting in the gravel of thawed streams  were ocean-deafened voices warning me, lifted again in violence and epiphany. the longship’s swimming tongue  was buoyant with hindsight— it said thor’s hammer swung to geography and trade, thick-witted couplings and revenges,  the hatreds and behind-backs of the althing, lies and women, exhaustions nominated peace, memory incubating the spilled blood.  it said, ‘lie down in the word-hoard, burrow the coil and gleam of your furrowed brain.  compose in darkness. expect aurora borealis in the long foray but no cascade of light.  keep your eye clear as the bleb of the icicle, trust the feel of what nubbed treasure your hands have known.’  
NEW POEM
 she holds a conversation with her ornaments, stray or contingent, heaped in patches darkly and then loosened onto the table to be consumed. collect me, they seem to ask, into an assembly; construe us like any morning onto any day. bring us forward notch by notch into a paradigm of comfort to be clasped: any cup will do. any dance? take a seed and blow it toward the curtain which, like a bright shield hugging breasts into radiance, is seen and spoken of and desired. will any silence fit? so many columns of air are held upright in inebriated passage, so many paper stacks brittle under the weight of what was news to attentive readers as zones of holy strangers feed through tunnels their imported cares. stare at us, they seem to say, we are windows propped up against the sky, quotations of light waiting to sail into your aperture, calling because because and now now now. and the good body is pulled over the original rapacious body like a huge sock, its cornucopia of sour wind and dust emptied into the firmament.  
NEW POEM
 with her one horrid eye persistently unfastened, a vigilant bird watched my grandfather during the great depression use each evening of one whole year to wander his corn fields knowing this world is just one pig after another  in one pen after another. therefore, the bird heard him suppose, shouldn’t he with his best gun, machete, buick, or rope terminate his acquaintance with the tiresome setup of breakfast-lunch-dinner-dawn-dusk-fall-winter-spring-summer-  blah-blah-blah? but his girls were good-looking and made such fine pies, so the bird watched him live wretchedly until he died more naturally of cancer too soon to see his people become the dopefiends, doctor-haters,  masturbators, insomniacs, sleep fanatics, shut-ins, and teetotalers the bird knew they would become, for the purpose of girls is to just ruin everything with wanton reproduction so that now now now it’s really relentless—how heavy  his people got in their limbs and how torrential, thus, the frenzied wind, though beyond the eye of the bird is the small, ashen brain of the bird, and below that, a heart, i swear, through which come the iffy notes of this cruel song.  
NEW POEM
 snow would be the easy way out—that softening sky like a sigh of relief at finally being allowed to yield. no dice. we stack twigs for burning in glistening patches but the rain won’t give.  so we wait, breeding mood, making music of decline. we sit down in the smell of the past and rise in a light that is already leaving. we ache in secret, memorizing  a gloomy line or two of german. when spring comes we promise to act the fool. pour, rain! sail, wind, with your cargo of zithers!   november 1981

NEW POEM
 when all the golden birds fly home across the blue deep water; on shore i sit rapt in its scattering glitter; departure rustles through the trees. this farewell is vast and separation draws close, but reunion, that also is certain.  my head on my arm i fall asleep easily. on my eyes a mother’s breath, from her mouth to my heart: sleep, child, and dream now the sun is gone.—  
NEW POEM
 if all the world and love were young, and truth in every shepherd’s tongue, these pretty pleasures might me move, to live with thee, and be thy love.  time drives the flocks from field to fold, when rivers rage and rocks grow cold, and philomel becometh dumb, the rest complains of cares to come.  the flowers do fade, and wanton fields, to wayward winter reckoning yields, a honey tongue, a heart of gall, is fancy’s spring, but sorrow’s fall.  thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten: in folly ripe, in reason rotten.  thy belt of straw and ivy buds, the coral clasps and amber studs, all these in me no means can move to come to thee and be thy love.  but could youth last, and love still breed, had joys no date, nor age no need, then these delights my mind might move to live with thee, and be thy love.  
NEW POEM
 late august was a pressure drop, rain, a sob in the body,  a handful of air with a dream in it,  summer was desperate to paradise itself with blackberry  drupelets and swarms, everything polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps  gushing, the stars like sweat on a boxer's skin. a voice  from the day says tax cuts  for the rich or scratch what itches or it's a sax  from bitches brew, and i'm a fool  for these horns and hues, this maudlin  light. it's a currency of feeling in unremembered march.  there's a war on and snow in the city where we've made our desire stop  and start. in the dying school of bruce i'm the student who still believes  in the bad taste of the beautiful and the sadness of songs  made in the ratio of bruise for bruise.  
NEW POEM
 ms. marcus says that an occasional poem is a poem written about something important or special that's gonna happen or already did. think of a specific occasion, she says — and write about it.  like what?! lamont asks. he's all slouched down in his seat. i don't feel like writing about no occasion.  how about your birthday?  
NEW POEM
 far, far out lie the white sails all at rest; like spectral arms they seem to touch and cling unto the wide horizon. not a wing of truant bird glides down the purpling west; no breeze dares to intrude, e’en on a quest to fan a lover’s brow; the waves to sing have quite forgotten till the deep shall fling a bow across its vibrant chords. then, lest one moment of the sea’s repose we lose, nor furnish fancy with a thousand themes of unimagined sweetness, let us gaze on this serenity, for as we muse, lo! all is restless motion: life’s best dreams give changing moods to even halcyon days.  
NEW POEM
 although a tide turns in the trees the moon doesn't turn the leaves, though chimneys smoke and blue concedes to bluer home-time dark.  though restless leaves submerge the park in yellow shallows, ankle-deep, and through each tree the moon shows, halved or quartered or complete,  the moon's no fruit and has no seed, and turns no tide of leaves on paths that still persist but do not lead where they did before dark.  although the moonstruck pond stares hard the moon looks elsewhere. manholes breathe. each mind's a different, distant world this same moon will not leave.  
NEW POEM
 i  it’s odd to have a separate month. it escapes the year, it is not only cold, it is warm and loving like a death grip on a willing knee. the indians have a name for it, they call it: “summer!” the tepees shake in the blast like roosters at dawn. everything is special to them, the colorful ones.   ii  somehow the housewife does not seem gentle. is she angry because her husband likes october? is it snow bleeds softly from her shoes? the nest eggs have captured her, but april rises from her bed.   iii  “the beggars are upon us!” cried chester.  three strangers appeared at the door, demanding ribbons.  the october wind . . . nests   iv  why do i think october is beautiful? it is not, is not beautiful. but then what is there to hold one’s interest between the various drifts of a day’s work, but to search out the differences the window and grate— but it is not, is not beautiful.   v  i think your face is beautiful, the way it is close to my face, and i think you are the real october with your transparence and the stone of your words as they pass, as i do not hear them.    
NEW POEM
 a car is idling on the cliff. its top is down. its headlights throw a faint, bright ghost-shadow glow on the pale air. on the shore, so far below that the waves' push and drag is dwindled to a hush—a kind of oceanic idle—the sea among the boulders plays a blind- fold game of hide and seek, or capture the flag. the flag swells and sways. the car is empty. a friday, the first week of june. nineteen fifty-three.  a car's idling on the cliff, but surely it won't be long before somebody stops to investigate and things begin to happen fast: men, troops of men will come, arrive with blazing lights, a blast of sirens, followed by still more men. though not a soul's in sight, the peace of the end of the late afternoon—the sun down, but enough light even so to bathe the heavens from horizon to shore in a deep and delicate blue—will not keep.  confronted with such an overload of questions (most beginning,why would she... so gifted, bright, and only twenty-three), attention will come to fix upon this odd last thing she did: leaving the car running, the headlights on. she stopped—it will transpire—to fill the tank a mere two miles down the road. (just sixteen, the kid at the station will quote her as saying, "what a pity you have to work today! it's not right... what weather! goodness, what a night it'll be!" he'll add: "she sure was pretty.")  was there a change of plan? why the stop for gas? possibly she'd not yet made up her mind? or had made it up but not yet settled on a place? or could it be she knew where she was headed, what she would do— and wanted to make sure the car ran for hours afterward? might the car not be, then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- in-reverse, meant to direct one not away from but toward the shore and its broken boulders, there to spot the bobbing white flag of a blouse?  her brief note, which will appear in the local leader, contains a phrase ("she chanted snatches of old lands") that will muddle the town for three days, until a professor e. h. wade pins it to ophelia—and reprimands the police, who, this but goes to show, have not the barest knowledge of shakespeare, else would never have misread "lauds" as "lands." a detective gregg messing will answer, tersely, "afraid it's not our bailiwick. missing persons, yes; missing poems, no."  (what's truly tragic's never allowed to stand alone for long, of course. at each moment there's a crowd of clowns pressing in: the booming ass at every wake who, angling a loud necktie in the chip dip, airs his problems with intestinal gas, or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell siding to the grieving mother . . . . well, wade sent the leader another briefword: "decades of service to the bard now force me to amend the girl's little slip. 'chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . .")  yet none of her unshakeable entourage —pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, and a yearning young grease-monkey—are alerted yet. still the empty car idles, idles on the cliff, and night isn't falling so much as day is floating out to sea . . . . soon, whether she's found or not, her lights will draw moths and tiny dark-winged things that might be dirt-clumps, ashes. come what may, the night will be lovely, as she foresaw, the first stars easing through the blue, engine and ocean breathing together.

 o goddess! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung by sweet enforcement and remembrance dear, and pardon that thy secrets should be sung even into thine own soft-conched ear: surely i dreamt to-day, or did i see the winged psyche with awaken'd eyes? i wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, and, on the sudden, fainting with surprise, saw two fair creatures, couched side by side in deepest grass, beneath the whisp'ring roof of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran a brooklet, scarce espied:  mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed, blue, silver-white, and budded tyrian, they lay calm-breathing, on the bedded grass; their arms embraced, and their pinions too; their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu, as if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, and ready still past kisses to outnumber at tender eye-dawn of aurorean love: the winged boy i knew; but who wast thou, o happy, happy dove? his psyche true!  o latest born and loveliest vision far of all olympus' faded hierarchy! fairer than phoebe's sapphire-region'd star, or vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky; fairer than these, though temple thou hast none, nor altar heap'd with flowers; nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan upon the midnight hours; no voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet from chain-swung censer teeming; no shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.  o brightest! though too late for antique vows, too, too late for the fond believing lyre, when holy were the haunted forest boughs, holy the air, the water, and the fire; yet even in these days so far retir'd from happy pieties, thy lucent fans, fluttering among the faint olympians, i see, and sing, by my own eyes inspir'd. so let me be thy choir, and make a moan upon the midnight hours; thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet from swinged censer teeming; thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat of pale-mouth'd prophet dreaming.  yes, i will be thy priest, and build a fane in some untrodden region of my mind, where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain, instead of pines shall murmur in the wind: far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep; and there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees, the moss-lain dryads shall be lull'd to sleep; and in the midst of this wide quietness a rosy sanctuary will i dress with the wreath'd trellis of a working brain, with buds, and bells, and stars without a name, with all the gardener fancy e'er could feign, who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: and there shall be for thee all soft delight that shadowy thought can win, a bright torch, and a casement ope at night, to let the warm love in!

 as if it were a scene made-up by the mind, that is not mine, but is a made place,  that is mine, it is so near to the heart, an eternal pasture folded in all thought so that there is a hall therein  that is a made place, created by light wherefrom the shadows that are forms fall.  wherefrom fall all architectures i am i say are likenesses of the first beloved whose flowers are flames lit to the lady.  she it is queen under the hill whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words that is a field folded.  it is only a dream of the grass blowing east against the source of the sun in an hour before the sun’s going down  whose secret we see in a children’s game of ring a round of roses told.  often i am permitted to return to a meadow as if it were a given property of the mind that certain bounds hold against chaos,  that is a place of first permission, everlasting omen of what is.

 snake walks with that old squiggly stick, walks slow down by the waterfall, from stone to stone down by the waterfall, shuffling on his bare feet while dancing on the edge of it. now shimmer that, now shimmer this, while now just one, an old one steps the beat of it. how may he walk with that old squirmy stick? soft, soft he goes, and gathers sun. soft, soft he goes, he has no bones. soft, soft he goes, and gathers wind. about his neck, a bone flute hums the flux of it. something congeals and flows. snake says, just spirit matters.

 a host of poppies, a flight of swallows; a flurry of rain, and a wind that follows shepherds the leaves in the sheltered hollows for the forest is shaken and thinned.  over my head are the firs for rafter; the crows blow south, and my heart goes after; i kiss my hands to the world with laughter— is it aidenn or mystical ind?  oh, the whirl of the fields in the windy weather! how the barley breaks and blows together! oh, glad is the free bird afloat on the heather— oh, the whole world is glad of the wind!

 oh! the old swimmin'-hole! whare the crick so still and deep looked like a baby-river that was laying half asleep, and the gurgle of the worter round the drift jest below sounded like the laugh of something we onc't ust to know before we could remember anything but the eyes of the angels lookin' out as we left paradise; but the merry days of youth is beyond our controle, and it's hard to part ferever with the old swimmin'-hole.  oh! the old swimmin'-hole! in the happy days of yore, when i ust to lean above it on the old sickamore, oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny tide that gazed back at me so gay and glorified, it made me love myself, as i leaped to caress my shadder smilin' up at me with sich tenderness. but them days is past and gone, and old time's tuck his toll from the old man come back to the old swimmin'-hole.  oh! the old swimmin'-hole! in the long, lazy days when the humdrum of school made so many run-a-ways, how plesant was the jurney down the old dusty lane, whare the tracks of our bare feet was all printed so plane you could tell by the dent of the heel and the sole they was lots o' fun on hands at the old swimmin'-hole. but the lost joys is past! let your tears in sorrow roll like the rain that ust to dapple up the old swimmin'-hole.  thare the bullrushes growed, and the cattails so tall, and the sunshine and shadder fell over it all; and it mottled the worter with amber and gold tel the glad lilies rocked in the ripples that rolled; and the snake-feeder's four gauzy wings fluttered by like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the sky, or a wownded apple-blossom in the breeze's controle as it cut acrost some orchard to'rds the old swimmin'-hole.  oh! the old swimmin'-hole! when i last saw the place, the scenes was all changed, like the change in my face; the bridge of the railroad now crosses the spot whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot. and i stray down the banks whare the trees ust to be— but never again will theyr shade shelter me! and i wish in my sorrow i could strip to the soul, and dive off in my grave like the old swimmin'-hole.

 all those poems i wrote about living in the sky were wrong. i live on a leaf of   a fern of   frost growing up your bedroom window in forty below.  i live on a needle of   a branch of   a cedar tree, hard-bitten, striving in six directions, rooted in rock, a cedar tree made of other trees, not cedar but fir,  lodgepole, and blue spruce, metastasizing like bacteria to the fan- lip of a draw to draw water as soon as it slips from the snowdrift’s grip  and flows downward from branch to root — a tree running in reverse. or i live on a thorn on a trellis — trained, restrained, maybe cut back, to hold up  those flowers i’ve only heard of to whatever there is and isn’t above.

 oh! could i see as thou hast seen, the garden of the west, when spring in all her loveliness fair nature’s face has dressed.  the rolling prairie, vast and wild! it hath a charm for me— its tall grass waving to the breeze, like billows on the sea.  say, hast thou chased the bounding deer when smiled the rosy morn? or hast thou listened to the sound of the merry hunter’s horn?  once could the noble red-man call that prairie wild his home;— his cabin now in ruins laid, he must an exile roam,  and thou at twilight’s pensive hour, perchance hast seen him weep;— tread lightly o’er the hallowed spot, for there his kindred sleep.  i envy not the opulent his proud and lordly dome; far happier is the pioneer who seeks a prairie home;—  where no discordant notes are heard, but all is harmony; where soars aloft unfettered thought, and the heart beats light and free.

 all our roads go nowhere. maps are curled to keep the pavement definitely on the world.  all our footsteps, set to make metric advance, lapse into arcs in deference to circumstance.  all our journeys nearing space skirt it with care, shying at the distances present in air.  blithely travel-stained and worn, erect and sure, all our travels go forth, making down the roads of earth endless detour.

 my father in the aluminum stern, cursing another fouled blood-knot: all the shits  and fucks as integral to the art of fishing as the bait-fish, little silver smelts  i sewed like a manual transmission, the same inbred order and precision  needling the leader through the ass, out the mouth, through the jaw, out the nostril  and back down—suffering as my father suffered the bastard no-see-ums and the guttering johnson  the obligatory dud, orange egg-pearls ballooning from its bust underside, hundreds of duds  like every shit-luck setback that drove us on, fed by the huge image of everything  we'd never caught, moving in joint blindness under munsungun. and whatever it was it was the fight that delivered us—a tension  like a sequestered muscle, the line spooling, unspooling, the holy-shit-  litany pulled from our awed mouths contracting with distance until a whole  silence surfaced, the viscid, slapping body absorbing and reflecting raw light  like the bit of cornea above a pupil. and then his tremendous, decent hands  brandishing an oar-butt; the brilliant lace of the gills, their crumpled hinge flaring  in bilge water; and the line, whipping and shuttling, feeding invisibly back,  moving on on munsungun, sons survived by the same damn hunt they heired.

 for jean brockway when the walkers-on-water went under, the bog-walkers came out of the barberry thickets, booted in gum to their hips, in a corona of midges, their ears electric with sound, beating the stale of the swamp with their whips and flailing the ground for the itch under the frond, the fern’s demonology, the mosquito’s decibel.  night-sweat clotted their palms. they tasted their gall. the sumac flickered a swatch of its leaves in the lichens and venoms, a dazzle was seen in the fog as a vegetal world gave way to a uterine, pitch pulled at their heels and blackened their knuckles, the bog-laurel’s fan opened its uttermost decimal and showed them the bog.  paradisal, beyond purpose or menace, dewed like the flesh of an apple with the damp of creation, the disk of the pond glowed under the dragonfly’s bosses, where a faulting of glaciers had left it—vaults of bog-rosemary, buckbean and labrador tea, a dapple of leavening mosses soaking in ice-water, peat-wicks feeding their gas to the cranberry braziers.  they entered the bonfire together. the moss took their weight like a trampoline: they walked on the sponge and bitumen without leaving a footprint. in between, in the vats of mat-roses where the waterline closed like a skin, the ambiguous world of imbalance, non-being, the pre-human and tentative, was one with the ludicrous.  the quaking began—under their bootsoles at first, like a whale under ambergris, then cramming their wrists with a drummer’s vibrations, knocking their ribs and their knees as all sagged and rebounded. they lurched on the wet as though tracing a profile of breakers or displacing the cords and the voids of a net, and staggered back into their childhoods,  till their feet touched the granite again. the bog tossed them over the threshold that opened a path in the spruce toward the opposite edges. the leaves closed behind them. they walked an unyielding and tangible world like strangers, remembering only the hovering glare where the pitcher-plant’s hammer closed on the fly—the light shaking and shaking— as a pulse touched their feet from below, and passed over.  
NEW POEM
 snow is a strange white word; no ice or frost have asked of bud or bird for winter's cost.  yet ice and frost and snow from earth to sky this summer land doth know, no man knows why.  in all men's hearts it is. some spirit old hath turned with malign kiss our lives to mould.  red fangs have torn his face. god's blood is shed. he mourns from his lone place his children dead.  o! ancient crimson curse! corrode, consume. give back this universe its pristine bloom.

 along the grave green downs, this idle afternoon, shadows of loitering silver clouds, becalmed in blue, bring, like unfoldment of a flower, the best of june.  shadows outspread in spacious movement, always you have dappled the downs and valleys at this time of year, while larks, ascending shrill, praised freedom as they flew. now, through that song, a fighter-squadron’s drone i hear from scratchbury camp, whose turfed and cowslip’d rampart seems more hill than history, ageless and oblivion-blurred.  i walk the fosse, once manned by bronze and flint-head spear; on war’s imperious wing the shafted sun-ray gleams: one with the warm sweet air of summer stoops the bird.  cloud shadows, drifting slow like heedless daylight dreams, dwell and dissolve; uncircumstanced they pause and pass. i watch them go. my horse, contented, crops the grass.

 esteville begins to burn; the auburn fields of harvest rise; the torrid flames again return, and thunders roll along the skies.  perspiring cancer lifts his head, and roars terrific from on high; whose voice the timid creatures dread; from which they strive with awe to fly.  the night-hawk ventures from his cell, and starts his note in evening air; he feels the heat his bosom swell, which drives away the gloom of fear.  thou noisy insect, start thy drum; rise lamp-like bugs to light the train; and bid sweet philomela come, and sound in front the nightly strain.  the bee begins her ceaseless hum, and doth with sweet exertions rise; and with delight she stores her comb, and well her rising stock supplies.  let sportive children well beware, while sprightly frisking o’er the green; and carefully avoid the snare, which lurks beneath the smiling scene.  the mistress bird assumes her nest, and broods in silence on the tree, her note to cease, her wings at rest, she patient waits her young to see.  
NEW POEM
 the poetry of earth is never dead: when all the birds are faint with the hot sun, and hide in cooling trees, a voice will run from hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead; that is the grasshopper’s—he takes the lead in summer luxury,—he has never done with his delights; for when tired out with fun he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed. the poetry of earth is ceasing never: on a lone winter evening, when the frost has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills the cricket’s song, in warmth increasing ever, and seems to one in drowsiness half lost, the grasshopper’s among some grassy hills.  
NEW POEM
 uniformly over the whole countryside the warm air flows imperceptibly seaward; the autumn haze drifts in deep bands over the pale water; white egrets stand in the blue marshes; tamalpais, diablo, st. helena float in the air. climbing on the cliffs of hunter’s hill we look out over fifty miles of sinuous interpenetration of mountains and sea.  leading up a twisted chimney, just as my eyes rise to the level of a small cave, two white owls fly out, silent, close to my face. they hover, confused in the sunlight, and disappear into the recesses of the cliff.  all day i have been watching a new climber, a young girl with ash blonde hair and gentle confident eyes. she climbs slowly, precisely, with unwasted grace.  while i am coiling the ropes, watching the spectacular sunset, she turns to me and says, quietly, “it must be very beautiful, the sunset, on saturn, with the rings and all the moons.”  
NEW POEM
 i ran into the afterlife. no fluffy white clouds. not even stars. only sky dark as the inside of a movie theater at three in the afternoon and getting bigger all the time, expanding at terrific speed over the car which was disappearing, flattening out empty as the fields on either side.  it was impossible to think under that rain louder than engines. i turned off the radio to listen, let my head fill up until every bone was vibrating—sky.  twice, trees of lightning broke out of the asphalt. i could smell the highway burning. long after, saw blue smoke twirling behind the eyeballs, lariats doing fancy rope tricks, jerking silver dollars out of the air, along with billiard cues, ninepins.  i was starting to feel i could drive forever when suddenly one of those trees was right in front of me. of course, i hit it— branches shooting stars down the windshield, poor car shaking like a dazed cow. i thought this time for sure i was dead so whatever was on the other side had to be eternity.  saw sky enormous as nowhere. kept on driving.  
NEW POEM
 ¿sólo una sombra?/only a shadow (ester iv)?, from the series santos y sombras/saints and shadows, 1993–1994, by muriel hasbun    my daughter gathers the seeds she finds in our desert, calls them spirits —the spirits are us, she says when i worry those orbs in my fingers  to conjure her birth. the wind’s first thought is to craft those seeds: vessels when the tree worries she’s not enough of a multiplicity,  that she will burn into the cosmos. the cosmos is no thought, no worry, more than us, but less than wind, and the wind is only the infinite,  not the body’s death, which is, after all, only a particle, but time formless as space. this is only if the wind worries at all. the seed doesn’t think  — she is the doubling ambition of a vessel. in the wind, the idea of the copy is translated by time. we were once that idea. my daughter  collects me in a box marked for spirits where i unsettle the other seeds begging for wind so that my sound will echo a thousand miles away.  my daughter was the pulse i toss into the wind with the seeds. particles of us pass over like whispers from the cosmos, the clatter  the wind makes. i worry birds will take her into themselves, that she’ll become a fleck of their transience, but this is how we furrow  ourselves into the cosmos, the twine of our breaths into wind, into carbon, into the tree’s colossal fingers reaching back from under the earth.  
NEW POEM
 1.  after the sweet promise, the summer’s mild retreat from mother’s cancer, the winter months of her death, i come to this white office, its sterile sheet, its hard tablet, its stirrups, to hold my breath while i, who must, allow the glove its oily rape, to hear the almost mighty doctor over me equate my ills with hers and decide to operate.  it grew in her as simply as a child would grow, as simply as she housed me once, fat and female. always my most gentle house before that embryo of evil spread in her shelter and she grew frail. frail, we say, remembering fear, that face we wear in the room of the special smells of dying, fear where the snoring mouth gapes and is not dear.  there was snow everywhere. each day i grueled through its sloppy peak, its blue-struck days, my boots slapping into the hospital halls, past the retinue of nurses at the desk, to murmur in cahoots with hers outside her door, to enter with the outside air stuck on my skin, to enter smelling her pride, her upkeep, and to lie as all who love have lied.  no reason to be afraid, my almost mighty doctor reasons. i nod, thinking that woman’s dying must come in seasons, thinking that living is worth buying. i walk out, scuffing a raw leaf, kicking the clumps of dead straw that were this summer’s lawn. automatically i get in my car, knowing the historic thief is loose in my house and must be set upon.   2.  clean of the body’s hair, i lie smooth from breast to leg. all that was special, all that was rare is common here. fact: death too is in the egg. fact: the body is dumb, the body is meat. and tomorrow the o.r. only the summer was sweet.  the rooms down the hall are calling all night long, while the night outside sucks at the trees. i hear limbs falling and see yellow eyes flick in the rain. wide eyed and still whole i turn in my bin like a shorn lamb. a nurse’s flashlight blinds me to see who i am.  the walls color in a wash of daylight until the room takes its objects into itself again. i smoke furtively and squash the butt and hide it with my watch and other effects. the halls bustle with legs. i smile at the nurse who smiles for the morning shift. day is worse.  scheduled late, i cannot drink or eat, except for yellow pills and a jigger of water. i wait and think until she brings two mysterious needles: the skills she knows she knows, promising, soon you’ll be out. but nothing is sure. no one. i wait in doubt.  i wait like a kennel of dogs jumping against their fence. at ten she returns, laughs and catalogues my resistance to drugs. on the stretcher, citizen and boss of my own body still, i glide down the halls and rise in the iron cage toward science and pitfalls.  the great green people stand over me; i roll on the table under a terrible sun, following their command to curl, head touching knee if i am able. next, i am hung up like a saddle and they begin. pale as an angel i float out over my own skin.  i soar in hostile air over the pure women in labor, over the crowning heads of babies being born. i plunge down the backstair calling mother at the dying door, to rush back to my own skin, tied where it was torn. its nerves pull like wires snapping from the leg to the rib. strangers, their faces rolling lilke hoops, require my arm. i am lifted into my aluminum crib.   3.  skull flat, here in my harness, thick with shock, i call mother to help myself, call toe to frog, that woolly bat, that tongue of dog; call god help and all the rest. the soul that swam the furious water sinks now in flies and the brain flops like a docked fish and the eyes are flat boat decks riding out the pain.  my nurses, those starchy ghosts, hover over me for my lame hours and my lame days. the mechanics of the body pump for their tricks. i rest on their needles, am dosed and snoring amid the orange flowers and the eyes of visitors. i wear, like some senile woman, a scarlet candy package ribbon in my hair.  four days from home i lurk on my mechanical parapet with two pillows at my elbows, as soft as praying cushions. my knees work with the bed that runs on power. i grumble to forget the lie i ought to hear, but don't. god knows i thought i’d die—but here i am, recalling mother, the sound of her good morning, the odor of orange and jam.  all’s well, they say. they say i’m better. i lounge in frills or, picturesque, i wear bunny pink slippers in the hall. i read a new book and shuffle past the desk to mail the author my first fan letter. time now to pack this humpty-dumpty back the frightened way she came and run along, anne, and run along now, my stomach laced like a football for the game.

 an apple tree bent double with fruit grew in the middle of the living room shaking gently as the average family pootled by with plates or devices in their hands  the room was almost all tree everyone edged round it curiously no one picked a single apple nor did the ripe fruit ever fall  the full tree stood there a daemon to behold  who lives in that house now i can’t tell you my childhood lives on there and my parent shadows and all my days and nights that will never bear fruit  the apple tree i speak of roots itself partly in truth and partly in lies those roots are splinters of the true cross they alone know why miracles are best avoided  
NEW POEM
 he glanced around to check if the treacherous gods had really given him the reward promised for his accomplished song and there she was, eurydice restored, perfectly naked and fleshed in her rhyming body again, the upper and lower smiles and eyes, the line of mouth-sternum-navel-cleft, the chime of breasts and hips and of the two knees, the feet, the toes, and that expression of an unimaginable intelligence that yoked all these with a skill she herself had forgotten the learning of: there she was, with him once more just for an instant as she vanished. and then he heard her from behind the invisible veil, absence: a shrill and batlike but lexical indictment. why had he violated the divine command, why, when he had seized all song to himself and robbed her of power to open her own oblivion? it grew in volume and now seemed to spew from an insane old mother with one breast hanging like a huge withered testicle from a rent in her weathered gown, who was being watched by a tall woman, copper-helmet-coiffed, richly suited in salmon colour, a mythical allusion, since salmon were long extinct in the bays and rivers here: songs never brought them anymore. the young restrained breasts and the old free one oppressed him equally and he went to live among men, waiting for the crazy and the competent to join forces and come for him with their scissors. orpheus listened patiently to my poem and when it quieted he said to me: that wasn't it at all. i sang outward from my face to blue spaces between clouds, to fern fronds, and men and women sipped my song as you drink from a stream going by. what i sang is lost in time, you don't kmow what it was, all you have is your own old stories about me. and if women tore me into pieces, maybe that only signifies each one keeps part of my body, which is melody among visible things.  
NEW POEM
 the air is drenched with day, but one by one the flowers close on cue, obedient to the declining sun. forest and grasses, bush and leaf and stem, they cannot move (and nor, you dream, can you); it is the wind that plays with them. only the little midges dancing still against the evening move at will.  this tiny swarm still dancing on and on like something in a net expanding and contracting, that late swan towing its wake, a solitary crow crossing the twilight in its silhouette, the fox proceeding sly and slow: they are small worlds of purpose which infuse the world around with will to choose.  an animalcule in a drop of dew— and so diminutive that if the human eye should look clear through that globe there would be nothing there to see— although it only has a blink to live, yet in the face of this is free; the oak, in whose vast foliage this dot hangs from a single leaf, is not.  
NEW POEM
 we don't see the ocean, not ever, but in july and august when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay of this valley, you could be walking through a fig orchard when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment you get a whiff of salt, and in that moment you can almost believe something is waiting beyond the pacheco pass, something massive, irrational, and so powerful even the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it.  you probably think i'm nuts saying the mountains have no word for ocean, but if you live here you begin to believe they know everything. they maintain that huge silence we think of as divine, a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls slowly between the pines and the wind dies to less than a whisper and you can barely catch your breath because you're thrilled and terrified.  you have to remember this isn't your land. it belongs to no one, like the sea you once lived beside and thought was yours. remember the small boats that bobbed out as the waves rode in, and the men who carved a living from it only to find themselves carved down to nothing. now you say this is home, so go ahead, worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust, wait on the wind, catch a scent of salt, call it our life.

 do you know what whole fields are? they are fields with a dog and a moon. do you know the answer — for the many?  except there would be vineyards. meaning there would, as usual, be commerce. money, and a game of sorts to play it.  meanwhile — emma lost in the cover-crop. top of her head bobbing through mustard-flower. it is, after all, still here —  the real world, the outstretched earth, rain, soil, copper for pennies.  
NEW POEM
 downhill i came, hungry, and yet not starved; cold, yet had heat within me that was proof against the north wind; tired, yet so that rest had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof.  then at the inn i had food, fire, and rest, knowing how hungry, cold, and tired was i. all of the night was quite barred out except an owl’s cry, a most melancholy cry  shaken out long and clear upon the hill, no merry note, nor cause of merriment, but one telling me plain what i escaped and others could not, that night, as in i went.  and salted was my food, and my repose, salted and sobered, too, by the bird’s voice speaking for all who lay under the stars, soldiers and poor, unable to rejoice.  
NEW POEM
 there were no road rails. i remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffs we motored along. i remember speed in a parched chevy clunker that could not have sped, and bench seats, and no buckles, and bare thighs peeling off faux leather at every hairpin. every elevated canyon mile was a feat but a breath of less slickened air too, less cog and fume — a winding away from the wavering, sea-leg steam off blinding sidewalks, infinite sidewalks and other shoeless kids kicking rusted palm leaves outside infinite apartment complexes. away from our corner of the valley of concrete corners, of no evidence of valley besides boulders stacked in the distance of every vista.  the driver was a stranger, was my mother after my whole life had passed with stranger after stranger, was my mother after seven years, and me at seven years with her driving that snuff-colored nova from her blinding valley not a valley — through laurel, topanga, malibu canyons all the way to some fantastic, to her beloved blue — eucalyptus choking local growth the whole trek. and the cooling air as we  efforted west, and the jolt of a castle,the castle, in a distant crook of a range that hid the slate of the ocean,  made me want to stop moving but not stop here. i remember hoping to find hermit crabs the size of the mole on my right side chin. and if i tethered them to a stick they’d line up by mass and trade shells, find homes that fit. and there’d be one left without, one torn out. a book said a scientist leaned into wet sand, watched a torn crab die in the beak of a gull. i can’t remember if i saw that death or read it.  i remember  watching a wrong castle tucked into a wrong mountain notch on the chin of the sky, like the hermit mole on my chin if my face were the sky. “it’s a beauty mark,” my mother had said, “don’t pick at it.” i eyed that smoking stranger at the wheel and dug my nail in as the pacific swelled into view that first time.

 because anyone sitting still attracts desire, even this will not be given you, the park in june, the silence of a bench at eleven o’clock  on a monday morning, or four on a thursday afternoon. someone will drift toward you, unattached and lonely. the spell will be broken, the wrong word said.  it is cool, but there is no death in the few token leaves that must have come down last night, in the rain that freshened, the tree-smell that remains. for this season there is no name,  not summer, and none of the months of the year— a something inside you. search your mind for the green arboriferous word the boys and girls swing out of  like a tree, and the lovers on the grass in tantric mode, in an ecstasy of untouching, and the human buddhas, legs infolded, reading.  branches, sheer translucent leaves— you would die to get under them forever, if it were given you, the park, on this, a day like any other day,  and not the knowledge of everyone ever met who will come upon you, sooner or later, if only you stay here. no, not people, or the walkways  made in another century, or the murmur of the great city everywhere in the distance, but this breathing-space where the void no longer terrible  but to be relaxed in, the depressions which anyway here are mild, incoming from the west, slow-acting, chronic, lifelong not acute  are there to be sat through, waited out on a damp bench, as a man sweeps up around you and the sun comes out in real time, stealing over the ground.

 i take pillows outdoors to sun them as my mother did.  “keeps bedding fresh,” she said.  it was april then, too— buttercups fluffing their frail sails, one striped bee humming grudges, a crinkle of jonquils.  weeds reclaimed bare ground. all of these leaked somehow into the pillows, looking odd where they simmered all day, the size of hams, out of place on grass.  and at night i could feel some part of my mother still with me in the warmth of my face as i dreamed baseball and honeysuckle, sleeping on sunlight.

 come live with me and be my love, and we will all the pleasures prove, that valleys, groves, hills, and fields, woods, or steepy mountain yields.  and we will sit upon the rocks, seeing the shepherds feed their flocks, by shallow rivers to whose falls melodious birds sing madrigals.  and i will make thee beds of roses and a thousand fragrant posies, a cap of flowers, and a kirtle embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;  a gown made of the finest wool which from our pretty lambs we pull; fair lined slippers for the cold, with buckles of the purest gold;  a belt of straw and ivy buds, with coral clasps and amber studs: and if these pleasures may thee move, come live with me, and be my love.  the shepherds’ swains shall dance and sing for thy delight each may-morning: if these delights thy mind may move, then live with me, and be my love.

 we could paint semi-darkness in semi-darkness. and the ‘right lighting’ of a picture could be semi-darkness.  wittgenstein from remarks on color these islands lie off the west coast of ireland as if nothing matters. the people have lived here for centuries with only a thin covering of soil over the surface. great use is made of the seaweed, the cattle swimming out.  the women here are justly famous. they weave their own tweed and make a type of belt called criss. the heavy atlantic seas, the slip stitch. the difficulty of the patterns are never written down.  most impressive and rich, the trellis pattern and the rope, the tribute to the hardworking bee. but sometimes their knitting shows mistakes, with a true irish touch of nothing really matters, a careless nonchalance of the crossing of their cables.  and note mistakes in the simple patterns: forked lightning or cliff paths, small fields fenced with stone, the ups and downs of married life, the mosses.  the openwork has a religious significance or none. sometimes the clarity of the pattern is lost through the use of very fine wool.  green from the mosses, brown from the seaweed, grey and cream color from the stones and pebbles: many are distinctly over-bobbled. no matter. they are too lovely to be lost. wool and knitting leaflets can be obtained.  in no case is the whole pattern given. there are certain gaps and yawns and part of the pattern is left out as if it doesn’t matter, or was too lovely, so was lost.  some of the simple patterns are charming for children’s jerseys. this one, for example, would be lovely on a child.

 i’m thinking it’s time to go back to the peach farm or rather the peach farm seems to be wanting me back even though the work of picking, sorting, the sticky perils and sudden swarms are done. okay, full disclosure, i’ve never been on a peach farm, just glimpsed from a car squat trees i assumed were peach and knew a couple in school who went off one summer, so they said, to work on a peach farm. she was pregnant, he didn’t have much intention, canvases of crushed lightbulbs and screws in paste. he’d gotten fired from the lunch counter for putting too much meat on the sandwiches of his friends then ended up in macy’s in new york selling caviar and she went home i think to scranton, two more versions of never hearing from someone again. i’d like to say the most important fruits are within but that’s the very sort of bullshit one goes to the peach farm to avoid, not just flight from quadratic equations, waiting for the plumber, finding out your insurance won’t pay. everyone wants out of the spider’s stomach. everyone wants to be part of some harvest and stop coughing to death and cursing at nothing and waking up nowhere near an orchard. look at these baskets, bashed about, nearly ruined with good employ. often, after you’ve spent a day on a ladder, you dream of angels, the one with the trumpet and free subscriptions to the new yorker or the archer, the oink angel, angel of ten dollar bills found in the dryer or the one who welcomes you in work gloves and says if you’re caught eating a single peach, even windfall, you’ll be executed. then laughs. it’s okay, kiddo, long as you’re here, you’re one of us.

 (through smoke) my mother became an ornithologist when the grackle tumbled through barbecue smoke and fell at her feet. soon she learned why singers cage birds; it can take weeks to memorize a melody — the first days lost as they mope and warble a friendless note, the same tone every animal memorizes hours into breathing. it’s a note a cologne would emit if the bottle was struck while something mystical was aligned with something even more mystical but farther away. my father was an astronomer for forty minutes in a row the first time a bus took us so far from streetlights he could point out constellations that may or may not have been draco, orion, aquila, or crux. when they faded i resented the sun’s excess, a combination of fires i couldn’t smell. the first chemist was a perfumer whose combinations, brushed against pulse points, were unlocked by quickening blood. from stolen perfumes i concocted my personal toxin. it was no more deadly than as much water to any creature the size of a roach. i grew suspicious of my plate and lighter bunsen burner, the tiny vials accumulating in my closet. i was a chemist for months before i learned the difference between poisoned and drowned. when my bed caught fire it smelled like a garden.

 my sister and i went out to them with sugar cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down to eat from our palms. we led them over to the long white fence on which we climbed to the topmost rail, then threw our legs across their backs, clutching the reins to steady ourselves against their girth, steering them out into the hills until we were lost, or thought we were, only to find ourselves at judith creek or holcomb rock where we’d turn back in the early dark, gripping their manes, crouching low, galloping hard on the high soft road across the fields to the open barn.

 it would have been a fine path for a lizard to cross but i saw none. brambles and sweet briar grew on the town side, poppies and wild grasses on the river. too hot for birds, the ducks were out, in water and mud, and frogs were out, by the hundreds it seemed, saying, way, way, in their deepest voices. it was beautiful there but i’d seen beauty and its opposite so often that when warmth broke over my skin i remembered winter, the way fresh grief undoes you the moment you’re fully awake. when she turned two, i asked my young friend what she would serve at her birthday party and she said, tofu and cupcakes. when she was three and i was very sad she called and said, what are you doing? picking flowers? she talked in poems like she was dreaming all the time or very old or virginia woolf. more often in the first world one wakes from not to the nightmare. when i dreamed i lost my love i willed myself awake because i would not survive the pain again, even dreaming. which is responsible for that mercy, doktor, the conscious or the un-? i want the poppies picked and i want the poppies left where they grow. like looking through the window of a moving train at someone walking up a road lined with poplars and being someone walking up a road lined with poplars. the train and the trees, a shower of petals and bees, sun on the glass and the train perpendicular to the road. things entirely themselves arriving in the deep double shadows of the grass and passersby.

 what god will catch me when i’m down, when i’ve taken sufficient drink to reveal myself, when my words are little more than a blurring of consonant and vowel?  i’m drunk on spring: branches of waxy leaves that greet me at my driveway, a family clutching trays of sweets. how can i sing of this?  if i cannot sing, then make me mute. or lend me words, send me the taste of another’s prayer, cool as a coin newly minted on the tongue.

 based on an old photograph bought in a shop at half moon bay, summer, 1999 no sound, the whole thing. unknown folk. people waving from a hillside of ripple grass to people below in an ongoing meadow.  side rows of trees waving in a tide of wind, and because what is moving is not moving, you catch a state of stasis.  opposite of this inactivity you imagine distant music and buzzing and crickets and that special hot smell of summer.  to the garden past the bay to the meadow, cliff sheltered with low clouds, offset by nodding thistle. tatter-wort and stinking tommy along footpath worn down by locals. but who and why?  in the photograph itself you’re now looking the other way to unknown clusters of houses. where forces are balanced to near perfection.  who could live in such a great swollen silence and solitude? you hear church bells from our lady’s tears breaking that silence nicely but just in the right way so silence continues as though nothing else matters day after day.  and anyway, each face seems so familiar.  what do you do when you wave back? you wave vigorously. you remember your own meadow, your cliffside and town, photographs forgotten, the halfhearted motion of your hand, your grandmother’s church-folk gathering on a sunday afternoon in saintly quietness.  you name the people whose names are not written on the back. you forgive them for wrapping themselves in silence.  you enter house after house and open top-floor windows and you wave down to future generations like this.  
NEW POEM
 my sister in her well-tailored silk blouse hands me the photo of my father in naval uniform and white hat. i say, “oh, this is the one which mama used to have on her dresser.”  my sister controls her face and furtively looks at my mother, a sad rag bag of a woman, lumpy and sagging everywhere, like a mattress at the salvation army, though with no holes or tears, and says, “no.”  i look again, and see that my father is wearing a wedding ring, which he never did when he lived with my mother. and that there is a legend on it, “to my dearest wife, love chief” and i realize the photo must have belonged to his second wife, whom he left our mother to marry.  my mother says, with her face as still as the whole unpopulated part of the state of north dakota, “may i see it too?” she looks at it.  i look at my tailored sister and my own blue-jeaned self. have we wanted to hurt our mother, sharing these pictures on this, one of the few days i ever visit or spend with family? for her face is curiously haunted, not now with her usual viperish bitterness, but with something so deep it could not be spoken. i turn away and say i must go on, as i have a dinner engagement with friends. but i drive all the way to pasadena from whittier, thinking of my mother’s face; how i could never love her; how my father could not love her either. yet knowing i have inherited the rag-bag body, stony face with bulldog jaws.  i drive, thinking of that face. jeffers’ california medea who inspired me to poetry. i killed my children, but there as i am changing lanes on the freeway, necessarily glancing in the rearview mirror, i see the face, not even a ghost, but always with me, like a photo in a beloved’s wallet.  how i hate my destiny.

 “all quiet along the potomac,” they say, “except, now and then, a stray picket is shot as he walks on his beat to and fro, by a rifleman hid in the thicket. ’tis nothing—a private or two, now and then, will not count in the news of the battle; not an officer lost—only one of the men moaning out, all alone, his death-rattle.”  *    *    *    *    *    *  all quiet along the potomac to-night, where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming; their tents, in the rays of the clear autumn moon or the light of the watch-fire, are gleaming. a tremulous sigh, as the gentle night-wind through the forest-leaves softly is creeping; while stars up above, with their glittering eyes, keep guard—for the army is sleeping.  there’s only the sound of the lone sentry’s tread, as he tramps from the rock to the fountain, and thinks of the two in the low trundle-bed far away in the cot on the mountain. his musket falls slack—his face, dark and grim, grows gentle with memories tender, as he mutters a prayer for the children asleep— for their mother—may heaven defend her!  the moon seems to shine just as brightly as then, that night, when the love yet unspoken leaped up to his lips—when low-murmured vows were pledged to be ever unbroken. then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes, he dashes off tears that are welling, and gathers his gun closer up to its place, as if to keep down the heart-swelling.  he passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree, the footstep is lagging and weary; yet onward he goes, through the broad belt of light, toward the shade of the forest so dreary. hark! was it the night-wind that rustled the leaves? was it moonlight so suddenly flashing? it looked life a rifle—“ha! mary, good-by!” and the life-blood is ebbing and plashing.  all quiet along the potomac to-night, no sound save the rush of the river; while soft falls the dew on the face of the dead— the picket’s off duty forever!

 glory be to god for dappled things – for skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow; for rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim; fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings; landscape plotted and pieced – fold, fallow, and plough; and áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.  all things counter, original, spare, strange; whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?) with swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim; he fathers-forth whose beauty is past change: praise him.

 glory be to god for sexy things— for cries of coupled lovers as they bind and bow; for moles that on her hip’ll make his dolphin swim, fresh and fired up; nutty balls; g-strings; lovescapes pulsing and flesh-shoaled—furrow and plow; and all shapes, their leer and freckle and whim.  all people dumpy, bald, regressive, strange; whoever is fickle, faithful (who knows how?) with slick, abrasive; sweet, sour; disheveled, trim; who father-forth and mother-forth all change— praise him.  
NEW POEM
 when i sleep i see a child  hidden between the legs of a scarred man,   their sunburnt backs breathe cold air, the child faces me   and the pier’s roof swallows the moon cut by the clouds behind them.   sometimes, they’re on the same roof wearing handkerchiefs   and uniformed men surround them. i mistake bullet casings   for cormorant beaks diving till water churns the color of sunsets,   stained barnacles line the pier and i can’t see who’s facedown   on boats lulled by crimson ripples. once, i heard the man —   alive and still on the roof — say today for you, tomorrow for me.   there’s a village where men train cormorants to fish: rope-end tied to sterns,   another to necks, so their beaks won’t swallow the fish they catch.   my father is one of those birds. he’s the scarred man.  
NEW POEM
 this is what you changed me to: a greypink vegetable with slug eyes, buttock incarnate, spreading like a slow turnip,  a skin you stuff so you may feed in your turn, a stinking wart of flesh, a large tuber of blood which munches and bloats. very well then. meanwhile  i have the sky, which is only half caged, i have my weed corners, i keep myself busy, singing my song of roots and noses,  my song of dung. madame, this song offends you, these grunts which you find oppressively sexual, mistaking simple greed for lust.  i am yours. if you feed me garbage, i will sing a song of garbage. this is a hymn.  
NEW POEM
 in the brown water, thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine, liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds, a pike dozed. lost among the shadows of stems he lay unnoticed. suddenly he flicked his tail, and a green-and-copper brightness ran under the water.  out from under the reeds came the olive-green light, and orange flashed up through the sun-thickened water. so the fish passed across the pool, green and copper, a darkness and a gleam, and the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank received it.  
NEW POEM
 it was a beach like all beaches, only perhaps more beautiful. and the sand was pink not red.  we would arrive in caravans, hampers overflowing with food and drink like aziz and his party on the way to malabar.  the colonials and their servants away on an outing. we would stop under thatch umbrellas, towels and tablecloths spread out against the sea.  my mother in her skirted swim suit surrounded by fathers of other children, her olive skin lit through her straw hat.  they would laugh and drink beer and leer while the children did the usual beach things,  boring futile tunnels to china, running at waves and then away, daring each other to be swallowed.  i would go out by the forbidden rocks and pick off oysters, then give them to the men to pry open, cover with lime juice and suck dry.  once, i saw my mother sucking an oyster out of another daddy’s hand. her dappled face bobbed and smiled and her tongue  searched the shell for pearls.

 tell the flowers—they think the sun loves them. the grass is under the same simple-minded impression  about the rain, the fog, the dew. and when the wind blows, it feels so good they lose control of themselves  and swobtoggle wildly around, bumping accidentally into their slender neighbors. forgetful little lotus-eaters,  solar-powered hydroholics, drawing nourishment up through stems into their thin green skin,  high on the expensive chemistry of mitochondrial explosion, believing that the dirt loves them, the night, the stars—  reaching down a little deeper with their pale albino roots, all dizzy gillespie with the utter sufficiency of everything.  they don't imagine lawn mowers, the four stomachs of the cow, or human beings with boots who stop to marvel  at their exsquisite flexibility and color. they persist in their soft-headed  hallucination of happiness. but please don't mention it. not yet. tell me what would you possibly gain  from being right?

 i don’t belong in this century—who does? in my time, summer came someplace in june— the cutbanks blazing with roses, the birds brazen, and the astonished pastures frisking with young calves . . . that was in the country— i don’t mean another country, i mean in the country: and the country is lost. i don’t mean just lost to me, nor in the way of metaphorical loss—it’s lost that way too— no; nor in no sort of special case: i mean lost.  now, down below, in the fire and stench, the city is building its shell: elaborate levels of emptiness like some sea-animal building toward its extinction. and the citizens, unserious and full of virtue, are hunting for bread, or money, or a prayer, and i behold them, and this season of man, without love.  if it were not a joke, it would be proper to laugh. —curious how that rat’s nest holds together— distracting . . . without it there might be, still, the gold wheel and the silver, the sun and the moon, the season’s ancient assurance under the unstable stars our fiery companions . . . and trees, perhaps, and the sound of the wild and living water hurrying out of the hills.  without these, i have you for my talisman: sun, moon, the four seasons, the true voice of the mountains. now be (the city revolving in its empty shell, the night moving in from the east) —be thou these things.

 put nothing down to distress the reader. no barking dog. no rustle in the place whispers belong or photos of petals near collapse. erase oranges of confusing taste, a face wrinkled or in pain, a map with waterless rivers or water without a bend, still in darkness. here, where mystery  beyond hope comes too near, make a bright flight of leaves descend, none to smear all our spotless rivers. a map folds and unfolds, does not bunch or wrinkle. rainbows to last. the first endlessness of eden. this was the spot i was to start on, a leg steps out of the lake, a step falters instead into dashes that spread without prints onto the screaming bank.

 a fly wounds the water but the wound soon heals. swallows tilt and twitter overhead, dropping now and then toward the outward-radiating evidence of food.  the green haze on the trees changes into leaves, and what looks like smoke floating over the neighbor’s barn is only apple blossoms.  but sometimes what looks like disaster is disaster: the day comes at last, and the men struggle with the casket just clearing the pews.

 more nice than wise. xi mon. january [1733] hath xxxi days.  old batchelor would have a wife that’s wise, fair, rich, and young, a maiden for his bed; not proud, nor churlish, but of faultless size; a country houswife in the city bred. he’s a nice fool, and long in vain hath staid; he should bespeak her, there’s none ready made.  xii mon. february hath xxviii days.  n. n. of b---s county, pray don’t be angry with poor richard.  each age of men new fashions doth invent; things which are old, young men do not esteem: what pleas’d our fathers, doth not us content; what flourish’d then, we out of fashion deem: and that’s the reason, as i understand, why prodigus did fell his father’s land.  i mon. march hath xxxi days.  my love and i for kisses play’d, she would keep stakes, i was content, but when i won she would be paid; this made me ask her what she meant: quoth she, since you are in this wrangling vein, here take your kisses, give me mine again.  ii mon. april hath xxx days.  kind katharine to her husband kiss’d these words, “ mine own sweet will, how dearly i love thee! if true (quoth will) the world no such affords. and that its true i durst his warrant be; for ne’er heard i of woman good or ill, but always loved best, her own sweet will.  iii mon. may hath xxxi days.  mirth pleaseth some, to others ’tis offence, some commend plain conceit, some profound sense; some wish a witty jest, some dislike that, and most would have themselves they know not what. then he that would please all, and himself too, takes more in hand than he is like to do.  iv mon. june hath xxx days.  observe the daily circle of the sun, and the short year of each revolving moon: by them thou shalt foresee the following day, nor shall a starry night thy hopes betray. when first the moon appears, if then she shrouds her silver crescent, tip’d with sable clouds, conclude she bodes a tempest on the main, and brews for fields impetuous floods of rain.  v mon. july hath xxxi days.  ev’n while the reaper fills his greedy hands, and binds the golden sheafs in brittle bands: oft have i seen a sudden storm arise from all the warring winds that sweep the skies: and oft whole sheets descend of slucy rain, suck’d by the spungy clouds from oft the main; the lofty skies at once come pouring down, the promis’d crop and golden labours drown.  vi mon. august hath xxxi days.  for us thro’ 12 bright signs apollo guides the year, and earth in sev’ral climes divides. five girdles bind the skies, the torrid zone glows with the passing and repassing sun. far on the right and left, th’extreams of heav’n, to frosts and snows and bitter blasts are giv’n. betwixt the midst and these, the gods assign’d two habitable seats for humane kind.  vii mon. september hath xxx days.  death is a fisherman, the world we see his fish-pond is, and we the fishes be: his net some general sickness; howe’er he is not so kind as other fishers be; for if they take one of the smaller fry, they throw him in again, he shall not die: but death is sure to kill all he can get, and all is fish with him that comes to net.  viii mon. october hath xxxi days.  time was my spouse and i could not agree, striving about superiority: the text which saith that man and wife are one, was the chief argument we stood upon: she held, they both one woman should become; i held they should be man, and both but one. thus we contended daily, but the strife could not be ended, till both were one wife.  ix mon. november hath xxx days.  my neighbour h—-y by his pleasing tongue, hath won a girl that’s rich, wise, fair and young, the match (he saith) is half concluded, he indeed is wondrous willing; but not she. and reason good, for he has run thro’all almost the story of the prodigal; yet swears he never with the hogs did dine; that’s true, for none would trust him with their swine.  x mon. december hath xxxi days.  she that will eat her breakfast in her bed, and spend the morn in dressing of her head, and sit at dinner like a maiden bride, and talk of nothing all day but of pride; god in his mercy may do much to save her, but what a case is he in that shall have her.

 along ancona’s hills the shimmering heat, a tropic tide of air with ebb and flow bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow like flashing seas of green, which toss and beat around the vines. the poppies lithe and fleet seem running, fiery torchmen, to and fro to mark the shore. the farmer does not know that they are there. he walks with heavy feet, counting the bread and wine by autumn’s gain, but i,—i smile to think that days remain perhaps to me in which, though bread be sweet no more, and red wine warm my blood in vain, i shall be glad remembering how the fleet, lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat.

 she has no need to fear the fall of harvest from the laddered reach of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing from the steep beach.  nor hold to pain's effrontery her body's bulwark, stern and savage, nor be a glass, where to forsee another's ravage.  what she has gathered, and what lost, she will not find to lose again. she is possessed by time, who once was loved by men.

 i want you to know how it was, whether the cross grinds into dust under men’s wheels or shines brightly as a monument to a new era.  there was a church and one man served it, and few worshipped there in the raw light on the hill in winter, moving among the stones fallen about them like the ruins of a culture they were too weak to replace, too poor themselves to do anything but wait for the ending of a life they had not asked for. the priest would come and pull on the hoarse bell nobody heard, and enter that place of darkness, sour with the mould of the years. and the spider would run from the chalice, and the wine lie there for a time, cold and unwanted by all but he, while the candles guttered as the wind picked at the roof. and he would see over that bare meal his face staring at him from the cracked glass of the window, with the lips moving like those of an inhabitant of a world beyond this. and so back to the damp vestry to the book where he would scratch his name and the date he could hardly remember, sunday by sunday, while the place sank to its knees and the earth turned from season to season like the wheel of a great foundry to produce you, friend, who will know what happened.

 no one wants another paean to a rosy dawn, so it's good this one's bluish, baby-shade at the horizon, bleeding up into midnight like a botched dye job.  and having enough of the old world—larks, crakes, nightingales, storks—this space is populated by one fly crabbing across a notebook page. he seems, like me,  honey-slowed by winter's shortest days, clumsy and isolated. my love bought a black-and-white photo once, close-up of a birch trunk, fly crawling up  the curled paper bark, marring the purity of the image. you don't notice the fly until you do, and then you can't stop. no one wants a fly in art,  but there it is, elegantly framed. and we're over the epic, so here, first thing this morning, a pedestrian quarrel. years ago, i flew across a mountain range in black coat  and black boots to secretly meet him in the city. how many dawns did it take to arrive at this particular? at 9:30 the sky flares not like flame—a paper fan  you buy in chinatown for a dollar. a sudden breeze sways the tibetan flags strung along the eaves. i never noticed how thin the fabric. you can see right through the printed prayers  to the thermometer— five degrees—and beyond, birches leaning all to windward. sun bleaches out the last mysterious. now we pray to the real.  —11.29.2012

 every half century, the synchronous flowering of bamboo causes famine in parts of india. may we blossom every fifty years without afflicting the people.  may our seedpods nourish rodents who roam our groves  without rebuking lands with famine. may sweet potatoes and rice save us.  may ginger and turmeric flourish to the bitter distaste of rats  while tresses of bamboo flowers changeling white wasps  load the groves with seed in rare perennial synchrony.  may our sisters flower en masse hundreds of square miles apart  in the pale night. may our shoots pray a silent vision of healing,  our rhizome-laden memories: yes, we share our hunger  only once on this earth, my love. let us bless our fruit and multiply.

 let it come down: these thicknesses of air have long enough walled love away from love; stillness has hardened until words despair of their high leaps and kisses shut themselves back into wishing. crippled lovers lie against a weather which holds out on them, waiting, awaiting some shrill sign, some cry, some screaming cat that smells a sacrifice and spells them thunder. start the mumbling lips, syllable by monotonous syllable, that wash away the sullen griefs of love and drown out knowledge of an ancient war— o, ill-willed dark, give with the sound of rain, let love be brought to ignorance again.   originally appeared in the march 1964 issue of poetry magazine.

 whitecaps surge in from some infinite distance rocks, grottoes, clay stridencies beneath the storm amalgams of sea-wrack and brownish moss each tide pushes forth its flesh-antennae the persistent squid stretches its arms, wave-crests cave in, everything gives way to sand which silently drinks up the acid, cold red sweat those children launched in assault against the waves how could they turn their heads back toward those who've brought them this far to be taken even farther in their turn they passed though the crowd, laughing or crying without telling the password they've passed, the ferret runs and runs memory, the battlefield nurse, can barely triage the rarest ones whose heat shifts at the crater's edge yet they give our trajectory its dreamlike depth: the whole chain coils up in our smallest cells and in a lifetime time annuls itself  
NEW POEM
 —was it for this that one, the fairest of all rivers, lov'd to blend his murmurs with my nurse's song, and from his alder shades and rocky falls, and from his fords and shallows, sent a voice that flow'd along my dreams? for this, didst thou, o derwent! travelling over the green plains near my 'sweet birthplace', didst thou, beauteous stream make ceaseless music through the night and day which with its steady cadence, tempering our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts to more than infant softness, giving me, among the fretful dwellings of mankind, a knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm that nature breathes among the hills and groves. when, having left his mountains, to the towers of cockermouth that beauteous river came, behind my father's house he pass'd, close by, along the margin of our terrace walk. he was a playmate whom we dearly lov'd. oh! many a time have i, a five years' child, a naked boy, in one delightful rill, a little mill-race sever'd from his stream, made one long bathing of a summer's day, bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd over the sandy fields, leaping through groves of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill, the woods, and distant skiddaw's lofty height, were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone beneath the sky, as if i had been born on indian plains, and from my mother's hut had run abroad in wantonness, to sport, a naked savage, in the thunder shower.  fair seed-time had my soul, and i grew up foster'd alike by beauty and by fear; much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less in that beloved vale to which, erelong, i was transplanted. well i call to mind ('twas at an early age, ere i had seen nine summers) when upon the mountain slope the frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd the last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy to wander half the night among the cliffs and the smooth hollows, where the woodcocks ran along the open turf. in thought and wish that time, my shoulder all with springes hung, i was a fell destroyer. on the heights scudding away from snare to snare, i plied my anxious visitation, hurrying on, still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars were shining o'er my head; i was alone, and seem'd to be a trouble to the peace that was among them. sometimes it befel in these night-wanderings, that a strong desire o'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird which was the captive of another's toils became my prey; and, when the deed was done i heard among the solitary hills low breathings coming after me, and sounds of undistinguishable motion, steps almost as silent as the turf they trod. nor less in springtime when on southern banks the shining sun had from his knot of leaves decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the vales and woods were warm, was i a plunderer then in the high places, on the lonesome peaks where'er, among the mountains and the winds, the mother bird had built her lodge. though mean my object, and inglorious, yet the end was not ignoble. oh! when i have hung above the raven's nest, by knots of grass and half-inch fissures in the slippery rock but ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd, suspended by the blast which blew amain, shouldering the naked crag; oh! at that time, while on the perilous ridge i hung alone, with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!  the mind of man is fram'd even like the breath and harmony of music. there is a dark invisible workmanship that reconciles discordant elements, and makes them move in one society. ah me! that all the terrors, all the early miseries regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all the thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd into my mind, should ever have made up the calm existence that is mine when i am worthy of myself! praise to the end! thanks likewise for the means! but i believe that nature, oftentimes, when she would frame a favor'd being, from his earliest dawn of infancy doth open out the clouds, as at the touch of lightning, seeking him with gentlest visitation; not the less, though haply aiming at the self-same end, does it delight her sometimes to employ severer interventions, ministry more palpable, and so she dealt with me.  one evening (surely i was led by her) i went alone into a shepherd's boat, a skiff that to a willow tree was tied within a rocky cave, its usual home. 'twas by the shores of patterdale, a vale wherein i was a stranger, thither come a school-boy traveller, at the holidays. forth rambled from the village inn alone no sooner had i sight of this small skiff, discover'd thus by unexpected chance, than i unloos'd her tether and embark'd. the moon was up, the lake was shining clear among the hoary mountains; from the shore i push'd, and struck the oars and struck again in cadence, and my little boat mov'd on even like a man who walks with stately step though bent on speed. it was an act of stealth and troubled pleasure; not without the voice of mountain-echoes did my boat move on, leaving behind her still on either side small circles glittering idly in the moon, until they melted all into one track of sparkling light. a rocky steep uprose above the cavern of the willow tree and now, as suited one who proudly row'd with his best skill, i fix'd a steady view upon the top of that same craggy ridge, the bound of the horizon, for behind was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. she was an elfin pinnace; lustily i dipp'd my oars into the silent lake, and, as i rose upon the stroke, my boat went heaving through the water, like a swan; when from behind that craggy steep, till then the bound of the horizon, a huge cliff, as if with voluntary power instinct, uprear'd its head. i struck, and struck again and, growing still in stature, the huge cliff rose up between me and the stars, and still, with measur'd motion, like a living thing, strode after me. with trembling hands i turn'd, and through the silent water stole my way back to the cavern of the willow tree. there, in her mooring-place, i left my bark, and, through the meadows homeward went, with grave and serious thoughts; and after i had seen that spectacle, for many days, my brain work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts there was a darkness, call it solitude, or blank desertion, no familiar shapes of hourly objects, images of trees, of sea or sky, no colours of green fields; but huge and mighty forms that do not live like living men mov'd slowly through the mind by day and were the trouble of my dreams.  wisdom and spirit of the universe! thou soul that art the eternity of thought! that giv'st to forms and images a breath and everlasting motion! not in vain, by day or star-light thus from my first dawn of childhood didst thou intertwine for me the passions that build up our human soul, not with the mean and vulgar works of man, but with high objects, with enduring things, with life and nature, purifying thus the elements of feeling and of thought, and sanctifying, by such discipline, both pain and fear, until we recognize a grandeur in the beatings of the heart.  nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me with stinted kindness. in november days, when vapours, rolling down the valleys, made a lonely scene more lonesome; among woods at noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights, when, by the margin of the trembling lake, beneath the gloomy hills i homeward went in solitude, such intercourse was mine; 'twas mine among the fields both day and night, and by the waters all the summer long.  and in the frosty season, when the sun was set, and visible for many a mile the cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd, i heeded not the summons:—happy time it was, indeed, for all of us; to me it was a time of rapture: clear and loud the village clock toll'd six; i wheel'd about, proud and exulting, like an untired horse, that cares not for its home.—all shod with steel, we hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games confederate, imitative of the chace and woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, the pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. so through the darkness and the cold we flew, and not a voice was idle; with the din, meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud, the leafless trees, and every icy crag tinkled like iron, while the distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars, eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west the orange sky of evening died away.  not seldom from the uproar i retired into a silent bay, or sportively glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, to cut across the image of a star that gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes when we had given our bodies to the wind, and all the shadowy banks, on either side, came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still the rapid line of motion; then at once have i, reclining back upon my heels, stopp'd short, yet still the solitary cliffs wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd with visible motion her diurnal round; behind me did they stretch in solemn train feebler and feebler, and i stood and watch'd till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.  ye presences of nature, in the sky and on the earth! ye visions of the hills! and souls of lonely places! can i think a vulgar hope was yours when ye employ'd such ministry, when ye through many a year haunting me thus among my boyish sports, on caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, impress'd upon all forms the characters of danger or desire, and thus did make the surface of the universal earth with triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, work like a sea?  not uselessly employ'd, i might pursue this theme through every change of exercise and play, to which the year did summon us in its delightful round.  we were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, nor saw a race in happiness and joy more worthy of the ground where they were sown. i would record with no reluctant voice the woods of autumn and their hazel bowers with milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line, true symbol of the foolishness of hope, which with its strong enchantment led us on by rocks and pools, shut out from every star all the green summer, to forlorn cascades among the windings of the mountain brooks. —unfading recollections! at this hour the heart is almost mine with which i felt from some hill-top, on sunny afternoons the kite high up among the fleecy clouds pull at its rein, like an impatient courser, or, from the meadows sent on gusty days, beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.  ye lowly cottages in which we dwelt, a ministration of your own was yours, a sanctity, a safeguard, and a love! can i forget you, being as ye were so beautiful among the pleasant fields in which ye stood? or can i here forget the plain and seemly countenance with which ye dealt out your plain comforts? yet had ye delights and exultations of your own. eager and never weary we pursued our home amusements by the warm peat-fire at evening; when with pencil and with slate, in square divisions parcell'd out, and all with crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er, we schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head in strife too humble to be named in verse. or round the naked table, snow-white deal, cherry or maple, sate in close array, and to the combat, lu or whist, led on thick-ribbed army; not as in the world neglected and ungratefully thrown by even for the very service they had wrought, but husbanded through many a long campaign. uncouth assemblage was it, where no few had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards, which fate beyond the promise of their birth had glorified, and call'd to represent the persons of departed potentates. oh! with what echoes on the board they fell! ironic diamonds, clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades, a congregation piteously akin. cheap matter did they give to boyish wit, those sooty knaves, precipitated down with scoffs and taunts, like vulcan out of heaven, the paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse, queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay, and monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd by royal visages. meanwhile, abroad the heavy rain was falling, or the frost raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth, and, interrupting oft the impassion'd game, from esthwaite's neighbouring lake the splitting ice, while it sank down towards the water, sent, among the meadows and the hills, its long and dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves when they are howling round the bothnic main.  nor, sedulous as i have been to trace how nature by extrinsic passion first peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand, and made me love them, may i well forget how other pleasures have been mine, and joys of subtler origin; how i have felt, not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense which seem, in their simplicity, to own an intellectual charm, that calm delight which, if i err not, surely must belong to those first-born affinities that fit our new existence to existing things, and, in our dawn of being, constitute the bond of union betwixt life and joy.  yes, i remember, when the changeful earth, and twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd the faces of the moving year, even then, a child, i held unconscious intercourse with the eternal beauty, drinking in a pure organic pleasure from the lines of curling mist, or from the level plain of waters colour'd by the steady clouds.  the sands of westmoreland, the creeks and bays of cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell how when the sea threw off his evening shade and to the shepherd's huts beneath the crags did send sweet notice of the rising moon, how i have stood, to fancies such as these, engrafted in the tenderness of thought, a stranger, linking with the spectacle no conscious memory of a kindred sight, and bringing with me no peculiar sense of quietness or peace, yet i have stood, even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd, through every hair-breadth of that field of light, new pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.  thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss which, like a tempest, works along the blood and is forgotten; even then i felt gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth and common face of nature spake to me rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true, by chance collisions and quaint accidents like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain nor profitless, if haply they impress'd collateral objects and appearances, albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep until maturer seasons call'd them forth to impregnate and to elevate the mind. —and if the vulgar joy by its own weight wearied itself out of the memory, the scenes which were a witness of that joy remained, in their substantial lineaments depicted on the brain, and to the eye were visible, a daily sight; and thus by the impressive discipline of fear, by pleasure and repeated happiness, so frequently repeated, and by force of obscure feelings representative of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, so beauteous and majestic in themselves, though yet the day was distant, did at length become habitually dear, and all their hues and forms were by invisible links allied to the affections.  i began my story early, feeling as i fear, the weakness of a human love, for days disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring planting my snowdrops among winter snows. nor will it seem to thee, my friend! so prompt in sympathy, that i have lengthen'd out, with fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. meanwhile, my hope has been that i might fetch invigorating thoughts from former years, might fix the wavering balance of my wind, and haply meet reproaches, too, whose power may spur me on, in manhood now mature, to honorable toil. yet should these hopes be vain, and thus should neither i be taught to understand myself, nor thou to know with better knowledge how the heart was fram'd of him thou lovest, need i dread from thee harsh judgments, if i am so loth to quit those recollected hours that have the charm of visionary things, and lovely forms and sweet sensations that throw back our life and almost make our infancy itself a visible scene, on which the sun is shining?  one end hereby at least hath been attain'd, my mind hath been revived, and if this mood desert me not, i will forthwith bring down, through later years, the story of my life. the road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme single and of determined bounds; and hence i chuse it rather at this time, than work of ampler or more varied argument.

 aloft between heaven and them,  i babble the landscape—what staunch, vicious trees, what cluttered roads, slow cars. this is my  country as it was gifted me—victimless, vast. the soundtrack buzzing the air around my ears continually loops ditties of eagles and oil. i can’t choose. every moment i’m awake, aroused instrumentals channel theme songs, speaking what i cannot.  i don’t ever have to come down. i can stay hooked to heaven, dictating this blandness. my flyboys memorize flip and soar. they’ll never swoop real enough to resurrect that other country,  won’t ever get close enough to give name to tonight’s dreams darkening the water.  i understand that somewhere it has rained.

 come down, o maid, from yonder mountain height: what pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang) in height and cold, the splendour of the hills? but cease to move so near the heavens, and cease to glide a sunbeam by the blasted pine, to sit a star upon the sparkling spire; and come, for love is of the valley, come, for love is of the valley, come thou down and find him; by the happy threshold, he, or hand in hand with plenty in the maize, or red with spirted purple of the vats, or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk with death and morning on the silver horns, nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine, nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice, that huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls to roll the torrent out of dusky doors: but follow; let the torrent dance thee down to find him in the valley; let the wild lean-headed eagles yelp alone, and leave the monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke, that like a broken purpose waste in air: so waste not thou; but come; for all the vales await thee; azure pillars of the hearth arise to thee; the children call, and i thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound, sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet; myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn, the moan of doves in immemorial elms, and murmuring of innumerable bees.

 the skin ripples over my body like moon-wooed water, rearing to escape me. where could it find another animal as naked as the one it hates to cover? once it told me what was happening outside, who was attacking, who caressing, and what the air was doing to feed or freeze me. now i wake up dark at night, in a textureless ocean of ignorance, or fruit bites back and water bruises like a stone. it’s jealousy, because i look for other tools to know with, and other armor, better girded to my wish. so let it lie, turn off the clues or try to leave: sewn on me seamless like those painful shirts the body-hating saints wore, the sheath of hell is pierced to my darkness nonetheless: what traitors labor in my face, what hints they smuggle through its arching guard! but even in the night it jails, with nothing but its lies and silences to feed upon, the jail itself can make a scenery, sing prison songs, and set off fireworks to praise a homemade day.

 there is a land of pure delight where saints immortal reign; infinite day excludes the night, and pleasures banish pain.  there everlasting spring abides, and never-withering flowers; death like a narrow sea divides this heavenly land from ours.  sweet fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green: so to the jews old canaan stood, while jordan rolled between.  but timorous mortals start and shrink to cross this narrow sea, and linger shivering on the brink, and fear to launch away.  oh could we make our doubts remove, these gloomy doubts that rise, and see the canaan that we love, with unbeclouded eyes;  could we but climb where moses stood and view the landscape o’er, not jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood, should fright us from the shore.

 some quests begin before a person ever learns to walk. q’s began at the foundling home, when he was still in diapers. they’d kept anything pointed from the quonset hut where they housed the orphaned newbies, and later the house mothers forbade the children all but scissors with round edges, even table knives.  “mind, now stay in the queue,” they said, when his fingers reached for a safety pin or a paring knife or, once, one of the razors they kept (usually under lock and key) for the older boys. q slipped back in line.  only the blunt was available to him, nothing to question, naught with an edge. best pretend to be dull (though that was hard with a high iq) and never query:why hide the scissors? why hide the razor? why speak so sharply? why no mums? no dads? at night in his bed, listening to the breathing of all the other boys in the long room, he also asked himself,why me?  when the house mothers changed shifts, there were always some unsupervised minutes, and that’s when the boys sprang into swashbuckling. q loved leaping from bed to bed with an imaginary sword in hand.en garde!  •  at sixteen, with a razor cut on his chin from the new trial of shaving himself, q stood at the doors of the royal flower hall. he was quaking. this was the very first day of work in his life. he’d been supposed to be a shop assistant, a quotidian job like those of the other orphans who were all sent out to live as apprentices — to return only if found unsuitable. however, the royal flower keeper had stepped in and demanded to know the name of the boy meant to be sent to the local florist, and now young q was called to prep flowers for the queen.  “can’t someone else do it?” he quailed as the flower keeper  handed him a quilloned silver thorn knife. q didn’t want to be found unsuitable.  he quivered as thousands of roses arrived — he was supposed to separate their long, tangled stems, cut off the thorns, and queue them up straight on the tables for the arrangers.  “but i’m new!” q cried. he couldn’t quell his horror at the prospect of lifting a real blade to cut the thorns. “look, dear, no quibbling. if you work here, you’re qualified,” the flower keeper said. her knuckles bloomed out of the crooked stems of her hands. “hold the knife with two fingers behind this little crossbar, that’s the quillon, and snip under the thorn.” she did it with elegant speed. one thorn gone.  “it’s like swordsmanship,” the flower keeper joked, wielding her knife, fencing in miniature mime. in q’s head rang the orders of the house mothers, “ don’t touch! ” but in his fingers lay his imaginary weapon come alive.  “no time to be quiescent,” she said. “equipoise is all.”  don’t quit now, q said to himself. if he quit, he’d have to slink back to the orphanage, a failed apprentice, instead of going home to his newly found haven, a cold-water flat with a coin-operated heater, all his own. there he’d store the new paring knife his paycheck would buy, the pointed scissors    ...    so q quashed his fear and set to work.  •  he began to duel through the roses.  “en garde!” he whispered, lunging toward his petaled quarry.  soon there were thorns everywhere (some a bit bloody), but he did not make any big mistakes. he wasn’t perfect, like the flower keeper, but he was catching on. like quicksilver she flashed her knife, each stem quickening with the sharpest cut. instinctively q used the quartata maneuver, a quarter turn to the inside, protecting himself as he flicked each thorn into the quagmire of floral detritus on the floor. with each toss of the thorn he added to what appeared to the flower keeper to be his nascent gift.  as the lorries loaded with rose baskets and vases and bowls roared off to the palace, he quietly pocketed a thorn. then the first question he’d ever spoken aloud curlicued to his lips. and because he’d had to save up this query for sixteen years, he posed the essential one, previously mouthed only to himself at night in bed:  pourquoi?  “why,” said the flower keeper, “for the equerry, of course. and he for the queen. you know who she is.”  “just a flower of a figurehead,” q quipped.  the boy’s quick-witted, the flower keeper thought, and said, “we’ll require you tomorrow.”  and for quadruple tomorrows after that and after that, until q began to accumulate expertise. know-how defines a person, especially someone who’s grown up watching his p s and q s. he no longer  quavered, quadrillions of roses now quasi-ordinary, royal waste a quiddity.  i’m not a quitter, he’d said to himself, and each night went back to his cold-water flat where he had enshrined that little thorn in a matchbox.  •  well, he didn’t live in a cold-water flat now. now he lived in a sunlit house with a stash of razors in the marble bathroom and, in the drawers of his magnificent kitchen, a motherlode of paring knives, bread knives, steak knives, bird’s beak parers, boning knives, cheese knives, chef’s, clam, and carving knives, filleters, and mincers.  now q was senior keeper of the royal flower hall, walking across a stage toward the queen herself. he had kept the talisman thorn from his very first day with the roses. just that afternoon he had taken it out and dropped it in the pocket of his tuxedo, anticipating touching it for luck before he received his award from her majesty.  but when the queen posed her standard question, “have you come a long way?” q was quite bewildered as to how to answer.  sometimes a simple question cuts into an aromatic world of mysteries. but we must learn to answer, to cut. q, his distinguished silver hair perfectly trimmed, his neck properly shaved, looked down at the curls on the queen’s forehead and remembered his first unspoken word,why.  a quixotic word, an essential thorn. it had pricked him awake, into manhood.  arrangements of roses passed through his mind — how those magnificats of magentas quenched his imagination. how the choral crooning of pale pinks calmed his qualms. among roses he had reached his quintessence.  yet, is it a large enough life, to arrange roses for a queen? when the whole world out there hurtled toward famine and war? he hadn’t intended to stay, to make a future in flowers, taking people’s breath away with something so spectacularly unnecessary as his rose floats. he had been a thorn in someone’s side, spectacularly unnecessary himself. he’d been sent out into the world alone, blunted by the unknown facts of his identity — his search for his parents rewarded only by locked doors, locked cabinets, and, later, graveyards.  patiently her majesty waited for his answer. in physical distance he had come a short way, but he’d swashbuckled miles to reach the end of his quest.  “only from kew gardens, your highness,” q answered simply at last.  then she put into his palm the royal thank-you, in a quilted sleeve: a silver rose wreath made from an ancient mold that gave it stylized petals, prickly leaves, and, cut in at the bottom of the circle, a thorn.   “q from alphabetique,” 2013 by kara kosaka

NEW POEM
 while needles of the evergreen practice a windy chaos, heads of snarled hair; something in the tree longs for old age; bald brown knobs of skull without subterfuge; but it continues with its greedy resinous sexual odors. the odors rise against one another, spurting away from the scaly bark. along its fingers the tree holds out microscopic traps. popping bullets of sunlight crack into the subliminal orifices, and the tree thinks, “how exquisite. is this love?”  
NEW POEM
 the roman candle of a yard light caramelizes the old snow. the glow trespasses the dark hold of december, dimming the view  of the night sky with its winter triangle a boy strains to see through the haze, as he lets his jacket hang open, unzipped to the cold.  he knows to return through the black cleft between buildings, below electric wires that seem to carry a little train of snow  on their slim rails, where he throws the switch that shuts off the bulb on its pole, that opens the dome to a blast of stars in outer space,  to the pinpoint of jupiter, to the constellation of orion hunting the great bear that the boy follows to find a smudge of gray–he can gaze  through that peep hole to another galaxy also spangled with radiance from stars that traveled two and a half million light years  before appearing as a signal in the rod cells of his eyes that pass impulses through neurons and nerves  to his brain that creates images. he draws in a sharp breath, the high voltage power box of his chest hot and humming.  
NEW POEM
 with thick strokes of ink the sky fills with rain. pretending to run for cover but secretly praying for more rain.  over the echo of the water, i hear a voice saying my name. no one in the city moves under the quick sightless rain.  the pages of my notebook soak, then curl. i’ve written: “yogis opened their mouths for hours to drink the rain.”  the sky is a bowl of dark water, rinsing your face. the window trembles; liquid glass could shatter into rain.  i am a dark bowl, waiting to be filled. if i open my mouth now, i could drown in the rain.  i hurry home as though someone is there waiting for me. the night collapses into your skin. i am the rain.  
NEW POEM
 the day has pass’d in storms, though not unmix’d with transitory calm.   the western clouds, dissolving slow, unveil the glorious sun, majestic in decline.   the wat’ry east glows with the many-tinted arch of heav’n. we hail it as a pledge that brighter skies shall bless the coming morn.   thus rolls the day, the short dark day of life;   with tempests thus, and fleeting sun-shine chequer’d.   at its close, when the dread hour draws near, that bursts all ties, all commerce with the world, religion pours hope’s fairy-colors on the virtuous mind, and, like the rain-bow on the ev’ning clouds, gives the bright promise that a happier dawn shall chase the night and silence of the grave.  
NEW POEM
 a bride and a groom sitting in an open buggy in the rain, holding hands but not looking at each other, waiting for the rain to stop, waiting for the marriage to begin, embarrassed by the rain, the effect of the rain on the bridal veil, the wet horse with his mane in his eyes, the rain cold as the sea, the sea deep as love, big drops of rain falling on the leather seat, the rain beaded on a rose pinned to the groom’s lapel, the rain on the bride’s bouquet, on the baby’s breath there, the sound of the rain hitting the driver’s top hat, the rain shining like satin on the black street, on the tips of patent leather shoes, hokusai’s father who polished mirrors for a living, hokusai’s father watching the sky for clouds, hokusai’s father’s son drawing rain over a bridge and over the people crossing the bridge, hokusai’s father’s son drawing the rain for hours, hokusai’s father rubbing a mirror, the rain cold as the sea, the sea cold as love, the sea swelling to a tidal wave, at the tip of the wave white.

 if things were worse, this cursed rain would soak me unto sickness, so samuel sewall might have written in his vespers journal. i have it on my writing desk inside. for three days i have labored with a saw and plane and many boards to make my girl a swingset near her mother’s lilac shrubs, as rain has drizzled cold and meaningless. how coherent was his world of works and days, when plentifull rains might connote a coming providence—so sewall notes of her majesty’s court, june the eighteenth, seventeen twelve.  we are well satisfyed with the layin out of our money—

 with acknowledgments to “rain” by cynthia barnett whether the rain on mars was delicate or brutal  whether it was blue or gray  whether it fell on bare rocks that remained bare or on fertile ground that raised large forests of leafing trees  it could not last.  mars froze eventually in the same duration that venus by contrast bowed her burning head in noxious vapors and gas clouds.   •   on planet earth meanwhile  after half a billion years of continuous volcano-havoc meteor storms earthquakes               and lightning strikes  vapor stored in the atmosphere eventually began falling.  it soothed the fires.  when the fires died it fell silently on the first outcrops of moss.  on the tender grass with a sizzle.  with more strenuous drumming on the resilient fronds of ferns.  it became an orchestra of millions across the luxurious expanse of the tree canopy.  •   then the sun wiped its forehead with long filmy fingers and beamed afresh.  it worked through to creatures flourishing beneath the canopy and persuaded them to interrupt their work of scouring on all fours for delectable roots and berries.  in the clarified light they stared at their hands.  they saw the wrinkled fingertips that gave them a firm grip on slippery branches and vines gradually smooth      and soften.  they rose in amazement onto their hind legs and crept from shelter across the dazzling savannah.  •   after a summer of twelve thousand years  after the interruptions of ice  after one particular inundation and the shadow of an ark darkening fish-shoals as they scooted over hills and valleys  after the blaze of one civilization then another  after the destruction of several experiments with law and order  after the extinction of many beautiful languages  rain by and large found its place in the scheme of things.  it began to defeat its purpose on the private sky of umbrellas.  it babbled through long green fields and melted into the seams of poetry.  it larked in the puddle of its many names.  cobblers and chair legs and pipe stems.  frogs and jugs and beards.  cats and dogs.  men.  •   although they are shaped like a parachute thanks to the air pressure beneath them raindrops                     explode on landing.  then the sun bears down again fitting his monocle into his eye.  the glass flashes and burns.  the rain sweats and evaporates into the ocean of its air.  the ocean continues on its way continually overflowing here and there in quick little splashes or reckless floods and drenching.  it is delicate or brutal.  it is blue sometimes              and sometimes gray.  sometimes it falls on bare rocks at others                     it raises large forests of leafing trees.  
NEW POEM
 the door to the past is a strange door. it swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one direction only. no man can return across that threshold, though he can look down still and see the green light waver in the weeds.  loren eiseley     a door opens in the wilderness. people cross through it–bloused women families  acquaintances friends all the ones i have loved sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn–  street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into moons–and everything i’d known–  inside the bleak floating light of my lungs in the capillaries of my eyes a blood  glancing through the hatches– if i said i would always be grateful  if i lied or touched with spite if night is just a foamline of shadows  though we were both lost–the door opening–the fear of being shown  whole to the one who must love you still– and stopped as if on a walk to say  look at that and what matters what really counts and i’ll tell you everything if you promise i promise  i stood at door and behind me heard snow-plows scrape against roads  at the center of night–unknown to yourself and the word i said out-loud to no one  that meant it was all to no purpose the word for the desire inside destruction  for everything that can never be brought back– loose snow blown hard to each bank  and the common reel of those who to avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite–  snow blasted to piles–and never opened up to anything that could reach me until you reached me–  which hours belonged to us when was i unknowingly alone  why did you always return to walk here a path behind my closed eyes shedding salt  dry snowfall and sticks–still were you here with me i might say the moon rose in the casement window  the red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike there are still picnics there are fountains  and the world i am leaving behind says one learns to see one learns to be kind–  i closed my eyes i closed my hands i shut down the fields in my arms  the cattle on the plains veins ditches blue ravines a gray bird  sailing through a poplar brake kids throwing snow i closed the last swinging juncos  sheep wool caught on barbed wire i closed fumes and clear patches of sky i seized  the river the town i shut down the hard muscles of sleep farmlands  warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines on the ridge animals scattering across slopes i closed  the smooth bone of evening a storm on the hills white and noiseless spindled  prairies where i was born i shut i seized the clouds i closed in ager–fervor–ardor  
NEW POEM
 seven of them pinned in blood by long, shiny tails, three of them still  alive and writhing against the wood, their heaviness whipping the wall  as they try to break free, rattles beating in unison,  hisses slowly dying in silence, the other four hanging stiff  like ropes to another life, patterns of torn skin dripping  with power and loss, the wonder of who might have done this  turning in shock as all seven suddenly come alive when  i get closer, pink mouths trembling with white fangs,  lunging at me then falling back, entangled in one another to form  twisted letters that spell a bloody word i can’t understand.  
NEW POEM
 for our own private reasons we live in each other for an hour. stranger, i take your body and its seasons, aware the moon has gone a little sour  for us. the moon hangs up there like a stone shaken out of its proper setting. we lie down in each other. we lie down alone and watch the moon’s flawed marble getting  out of hand. what are the dead doing tonight? the padlocks of their tongues embrace the black, each syllable locked in place, tucked out of sight. even this moon could never pull them back,  even if it held them in its arms and weighed them down with stones, took them entirely on their own terms and piled the orchard’s blossom on their bones.  i am aware of your body and its dangers. i spread my cloak for you in leafy weather where other fugitives and other strangers will put their mouths together.  
NEW POEM
 light at each point was beating then to flight, the sapling bark flushed upward, and the welling tips of the wood touched, touched at the bound, and boughs were slight and burdened beyond telling toward that caress of the boughs a summer’s night, illimitable in fragrance and in sound.  here were the blue buds, earlier than hope, unnumbered, beneath the leaves, a breath apart, wakening in root-dusk. when the air went north, lifting the oakleaves from the northern slope, their infinite young tender eyes looked forth. here all that was, was frail to bear a heart.

NEW POEM
 lulled in a nook of north west bay, the water swells against the sand, hardly more liquid than venetian glass, in which clear surface, just a little way from shore, some four or five petite yachts pass with languid ease, apparently unmanned, adrift along the day,  imagining a breeze to fan their motion, though there's none. siobhan reaches a giant hand down from the sky and nudges with insouciant élan the nearest hull, her bended waist mast-high. that hand is just as magically withdrawn. so moves the catamaran.  and through the lilliputian fleet she, beatrice and gabrielle wade in the shallows, knee-deep, spaceman-slow, to fashion their maneuvers and compete among the stationed hours to and fro, while watching through the viscid slide and swell of water their white feet,  made curiously whiter by that cool light-bending element. doubled by shadows on the sand they glimpse pipefish and darting fingerlings they try impossibly to grab, translucent shrimps among the laceweed, seahorses intent to flee the peopled sky.  hard to conceive that they should be precisely who they are and here, lost in the idle luxury of play. and hard to credit that the selfsame sea that joins them in their idleness today, careless of latitude and hemisphere, blind with ubiquity,  churns elsewhere with a white uproar, or wipes the slave coast clean of trees, or sucks among the scum and floating drums of some forgotten outpost founded for the advent of an age that never comes, or bobs the remnants of atrocities limply against the shore.  what luck they have. and what good sense to leave the water with their toys when called, before their fortunes are deranged. and still the day hangs in its late suspense for hours without them, virtually unchanged, until the bay's impregnable turquoise relaxes its defense  and sunset's dye begins to spread in flood across it to the sand they stood on, as though, hoping to disown the blood of all the innocents he'd shed, macbeth incarnate or his grisly clone had stooped on some far shore to rinse his hand, making the green one red.

 we watched her grow up. she was the urgent chirper, fledgling flier. and when spring rolled out its green she’d grown into the most noticeable bird-girl. long-legged and just the right amount of blush tipping her wings, crest and tail, and she knew it in the bird parade. we watched her strut. she owned her stuff. the males perked their armor, greased their wings, and flew sky-loop missions to show off for her. in the end there was only one. isn’t that how it is for all of us? there’s that one you circle back to — for home. this morning the young couple scavenges seeds on the patio. she is thickening with eggs. their minds are busy with sticks the perfect size, tufts of fluff like dandelion, and other pieces of soft. he steps aside for her, so she can eat. then we watch him fill his beak walk tenderly to her and kiss her with seed. the sacred world lifts up its head to notice — we are double-, triple-blessed.

 i saw how beautiful your mansions are — your lakes and valleys and your peopled plain, but thought of  all that loss with all that gain, and one geography is not enough. one world, one world to loose the spirit in, will not contain a continental ghost. i have a dream of   islands drunk and lost, of   cities shining with a ripe decay where old ships feed about their harbors' knees, — far, far beyond your small and private seas.

 for one thing, there’s no more snow to watch from an evening window, and no armfuls of logs to carry into the house so cumbersome you have to touch the latch with an elbow,  and once inside, no iron stove waiting like an old woman for her early dinner of wood.  no hexagrams of frost to study carefully on the cold glass pages of the bathroom.  and there’s no black sweater to pull over my head while i wait for the coffee to brew.  instead, i walk around in children’s clothes— shorts and a t-shirt with the name of a band lettered on the front, announcing me to nobody.  the sun never fails to arrive early and refuses to leave the party even after i go from room to room, turning out all the lights, and making a face.  and the birds with those long white necks? all they do is swivel their heads to look at me as i walk past as if they all knew my password and the name of the city where i was born.  
NEW POEM
 for whom the possessed sea littered, on both shores, ruinous arms; being fired, and for good, to sound the constitution of just wars, men, in their eloquent fashion, understood.  relieved of soul, the dropping-back of dust, their usage, pride, admitted within doors; at home, under caved chantries, set in trust, with well-dressed alabaster and proved spurs they lie; they lie; secure in the decay of blood, blood-marks, crowns hacked and coveted, before the scouring fires of trial-day alight on men; before sleeked groin, gored head, budge through the clay and gravel, and the sea across daubed rock evacuates its dead.  
NEW POEM
 cats walk the floor at midnight; that enemy of fog, the moon, wraps the bedpost in receding stillness; sleep collects all weary nothings and lugs away the towers, the pinnacles of dust that feed the subway.  what stiff unhappy silence waits on sleep struts like an officer; tongues next-door bewitch themselves with divination; i like a melancholy oaf beg the nightly pillow with impossible loves. and abnegation folds hands, crossed like the knees of the complacent tailor, stitches cloaks of mercy to the backs of obsessions.  winter like spring no less tolerates the air; the wild pheasant meets innocently the gun; night flouts illumination with meagre impudence. in such serenity of equal fates, why has narcissus urged the brook with questions? merged with the element speculation suffuses the meadow with drops to tickle the cow’s gullet; grasshoppers drink the rain. antiquity breached mortality with myths. narcissus is vocabulary. hermes decorates a cornice on the third national bank. vocabulary becomes confusion, decoration a blight; the parthenon in tennessee stucco, art for the sake of death. now (the bedpost receding in stillness) you brush your teeth “hitting on all thirty-two;” scholarship pares the nails of catullus, sniffs his sheets, restores his “passionate underwear;” morality disciplines the other person; every son-of-a-bitch is christ, at least rousseau; prospero serves humanity in steam-heated universities, three thousand dollars a year. simplicity, flamineo, is obscene; sunlight topples indignant from the hill. in every railroad station everywhere every lover waits for his train. he cannot hear. the smoke thickens. ticket in hand, he pumps his body toward lower six, for one more terse ineffable trip, his very eyeballs fixed in disarticulation. the berth is clean; no elephants, vultures, mice or spiders distract him from nonentity: his metaphors are dead.  more sanitation is enough, enough remains: dreams do not end—lucidities beyond the stint of thought. for intellect is a mansion where waste is without drain; a corpse is your bedfellow, your great-grandfather dines with you this evening on a cavalry horse. intellect connives with heredity, creates fate as euclid geometry by definition:  the sunlit bones in your house are immortal in the titmouse, they trip the feet of grandma like an afterthought each day. these unseen sunlit bones, they may be in the cat that startles them in grandma but look at this or that they meet you every way.  for pelops’ and tantalus’ successions were at once simpler, if perplexed, and less subtle than you think. heredity proposes love, love exacts language, and we lack language. when shall we speak again? when shall the sparrow dusting the gutter sing? when shall this drift with silence meet the sun? when shall i wake?

 at the corner of wood street, when daylight appears, hangs a thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years: poor susan has passed by the spot, and has heard in the silence of morning the song of the bird.  'tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? she sees a mountain ascending, a vision of trees; bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide, and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside.  green pastures she views in the midst of the dale, down which she so often has tripped with her pail; and a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's, the one only dwelling on earth that she loves.  she looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade, the mist and the river, the hill and the shade: the stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise, and the colours have all passed away from her eyes!

 when we river, blood fills cracks in bullet shells, oars become fingers scratching windows into dawn, and faces are stirred from mounds of mica.  i notice the back isn’t as smooth anymore, the river crests at the moment of blinking; its blood vessels stiffen and spear the drenched coat of flies collecting outside the jaw.  night slows here, the first breath held back, clenched like a tight fist in the arroyo under shattered glass. but we still want to shake the oxygen loose from flypaper, hack its veins, divert its course, and reveal its broken back,  the illusion of a broken back.

 after li po while my hair was still cut straight across my forehead i played about the front gate, pulling flowers. you came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse, you walked about my seat, playing with blue plums. and we went on living in the village of chōkan: two small people, without dislike or suspicion. at fourteen i married my lord you. i never laughed, being bashful. lowering my head, i looked at the wall. called to, a thousand times, i never looked back.  at fifteen i stopped scowling, i desired my dust to be mingled with yours forever and forever, and forever. why should i climb the look out?  at sixteen you departed you went into far ku-tō-en, by the river of swirling eddies, and you have been gone five months. the monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.  you dragged your feet when you went out. by the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses, too deep to clear them away! the leaves fall early this autumn, in wind. the paired butterflies are already yellow with august over the grass in the west garden; they hurt me. i grow older. if you are coming down through the narrows of the river kiang, please let me know beforehand, and i will come out to meet you as far as chō-fū-sa.

 for wally roberts, 1951-1994 palaces of drift and crystal, the clouds loosen their burden, unworldly flakes so thick the border zones of sea and shore, the boundless zones of air fuse to float their worlds until the spirits congregate, fleet histories yearning into shape.  close my eyes and i’m a vessel. make it some lucent amphora, venetian blue, lip circled in faded gold. can you see the whorls of breath, imperfections, the navel where it was blown from the maker’s pipe, can you see it drawn  up from the bay where flakes hiss the instant they become the bay? part the curtain. the foghorn’s steady, soothing moan—warning, safety, the reeling home. shipwreck and rescue. stories within stories— there’s this one of the cottage nestled into dune  snowed into pure wave, the bay beyond and its lavish rustle, skirts lifting and falling fringed in foam. but i’m in another season—my friends’ house adrift, wally’s last spring-into-summer, his bed a raft, cats and dogs clustered and we’re watching television  floods, the mississippi drowning whole cities unfamiliar. how could any form be a vessel adequate to such becoming, the stories unspooled through the skein of months as the virus erased more and more until wally’s nimbused as these  storm clouds, the sudden glowing ladders they let fall? but that’s not the moment i’m conjuring—it’s when my voyager afloat so many months brought back every flood story i carried. drifting worlds, and wai min takes a shape i tell wally as  steady watermarks across the cold bare floor— chinatown, south pacific flashing its crimson, neoned waves tranced across wai min’s midnight eyes behind black shades, and that voice unraveling past each knocking winter pain. it’s another world  i’m telling, cognac and squalor. the foghorn’s haunting drone blends with that halting monotone, scarlet watermarks, the sinkiang’s floodtides murky brown, the village become water, swept away. three days floating on a door, his sister, the grandmother weaving stories endless  beneath the waxed umbrella canopy she’s fashioned, stories to soothe the children wrapped in the curtain of her hair, to calm the ghost souls’ blurred lanterns. how rats swam to their raft, soaked cats, spirits she said, ghosts held tranced by the storied murmurous  river. i have no spell, simply the foghorn’s song when voices unbodied, drift over water past the low dune this cottage nestles in becoming shape in motion stilled. no boundaries on this point, foghorn singing its come-home incantation over  the ruthless currents. and isn’t it so we’re merely vessels given in grace, in mystery, just a little while, our fleet streaked moments? as this day is given, singular, chilly bolts of snow chenilled across the sky, the sea.  how to cipher where one life begins and becomes another? part the curtain and here’s my voyager afloat, gentle sleeper, sweet fish, dancer over water and he’s talking, laughing in that great four-poster bed he could not leave  for months, a raft to buoy his furious radiant soul, if i may hazard to say that? yes, there was laughter, the stories, the shining dogs— gold and black—his company. voyager afloat so many months, banks of sunflowers he loved spitting  their seeds. tick. black numerals on the sill. a world can be built anywhere &amp; he spun, letting go. . . . the last time i held him, the last time we spoke, just a whisper—hoarse—that marries now this many-voiced mansion of storm and from him i’ve learned to slip my body,  to be the storm governed by the law of bounty given then taken away. shush and glide. this tide’s running high, its silken muscular tearing ruled by cycles, relentless, the drawn lavish damasks—teal, aquamarine, silvered steel, desire’s tidal forces, such urgent  fullness, the elaborate collapse, and withdrawal beyond the drawn curtain that shows the secret desert of bare ruched sand. i’ve learned this, i’ve learned to be the horn calling home the journeyer, saying farewell. and here’s  the foghorn’s simple two-note wail, mechanical stark aria that ripples out to shelter all of us— our mortal burden of dreams— adrift in the sea’s restless shouldering.

 i shall foot it down the roadway in the dusk, where shapes of hunger wander and the fugitives of pain go by.  i shall foot it in the silence of the morning, see the night slur into dawn, hear the slow great winds arise where tall trees flank the way and shoulder toward the sky.  the broken boulders by the road shall not commemorate my ruin. regret shall be the gravel under foot. i shall watch for slim birds swift of wing that go where wind and ranks of thunder drive the wild processionals of rain.  the dust of the travelled road shall touch my hands and face.

 mendota, illinois it's easy to believe you can go back whenever you desire, jump in the car and drive, arrive at dusk—the hour  you recall most vividly—and walk among the buildings spread across the farm, out toward the pastures, woods, and fields.  there is music in the leaves, in the dense columns of green corn. the wind lays down the tune. you can play it, too, simply  by walking with eyes closed, arms stretched out, lightly striking the stalks. who wouldn't desire, like the children  lost in so many similar fields, to sit down on the turned earth and drift away on the rhythms of his own  first possible death? rescuing voices come closer, veer off. flashlight beams strobe over your head. you do not care.  each building you remember—hen house, sheep shed, corn crib, barn—caved in upon itself, the walls and roofs collapsing with a final  percussive clap, since you last walked those fields. no one you will ever know works that land now. it is as green as eden. life rises in the roots, in the leaves.  
NEW POEM
 there is no escaping the storm of roses crisscrossed on the split-cracked wall of a dead fountain arch. there is no escaping their uterine balls, expanding as a reminder of the children i never had. if you listen carefully you can hear the vibrations, the heart drone of their petal jaw-harps. and there’s no going back, no indiscovery of mars or these red planets brooding before me, light predators, sun-hatched and bloodening like the fists of women who have gone to war.  
NEW POEM
 it’s a simple resistance  between the pull of springs and struggle of joints: two coiled silver muscles working in the lamp against blue washers and pivot plates, locking nut coolly swiveling loose with age.  in the arm  it’s done with blood: tissues plumped then promptly deflated.  what else am i supposed to start with?  not the light bulb, to which this whole narrative yearns, loving the glass envelope sizzling with light, grasshopper antennae scrubbed with electricity until each filament’s turned to fire.  no, i have to start with the arm first, the mint-blue lamp, then maybe light itself to specify what startles me  about you, globe of hot fruit, christ heart throbbing in the open chest; curtains of robe parted just enough to see what afterglow defines us, waits for us, rubbing its slow music out into the wet dark—  tonight, i’m counting out my seeds of waiting for you  through a current that is silent and might always be, though it thrums in every gesture: like this white eye burning within the metal shade i carefully adjust over a plate of orange slices each evening.

 it will be an island on strings well out to sea and austere bobbing as if at anchor green with enormous fir trees formal as telephone poles.  we will arrive there slowly hand over hand without oars. last out, you will snip the fragile umbilicus white as a beansprout that sewed us into our diaries.  we will be two bleached hermits at home in our patches and tears. we will butter the sun with our wisdom. our days will be grapes on a trellis perfectly oval and furred.  at night we will set our poems adrift in ginger ale bottles each with a clamshell rudder each with a piggyback spider waving them off by dogstar  and nothing will come from the mainland to tell us who cares, who cares and nothing will come of our lovelock except as our two hearts go soft and black as avocado pears.

 minutes ago those quick cleft hoofs lifted the dik-dik’s speckled frame. now the cheetah dips her delicate head to the still-pulsating guts. our rover’s so close we need no zoom to fix the green shot of her eyes, the matted red mess of her face. you come here, recall a father hale in his ordinary life, not his last bed, not the long tasteless slide of tapioca. this is the great rift, where it all began, here where the warthogs and hartebeest feed in the scrub, giraffes splay to drink, and our rank diesel exhaust darkens the air for only a few moments before vanishing.  
NEW POEM
 out of the winds' and the waves' riot, out of the loud foam, he has put in to a great quiet and a still home.  here he may lie at ease and wonder why the old ship waits, and hark for the surge and the strong thunder of the full straits,  and look for the fishing fleet at morning, shadows like lost souls, slide through the fog where the seal's warning betrays the shoals,  and watch for the deep-sea liner climbing out of the bright west, with a salmon-sky and her wake shining like a tern's breast, —  and never know he is done for ever with the old sea's pride, borne from the fight and the full endeavour on an ebb tide.  
NEW POEM
 the park admits the wind, the petals lift and scatter  like versions of myself i was on the verge of becoming; and ten years on  and ten blocks down i still can’t tell whether this dispersal resembles  a fist unclenching or waving goodbye. but the petals scatter faster,  seeking the rose, the cigarette vendor, and at least i’ve got by pumping heart  some rules of conduct: refuse to choose between turning pages and turning heads  though the stubborn dine alone. get over “getting over”: darks clouds don’t fade  but drift with ever deeper colors. give up on rooted happiness  (the stolid trees on fire!) and sweet reprieve (a poor park but my own) will follow.  there is still a chance the empty gazebo will draw crowds from the greater world.  and meanwhile, meanwhile’s far from nothing: the humming moment, the rustle of cherry trees.

NEW POEM
 1 adios, carenage  in idle august, while the sea soft, and leaves of brown islands stick to the rim of this caribbean, i blow out the light by the dreamless face of maria concepcion to ship as a seaman on the schooner flight. out in the yard turning gray in the dawn, i stood like a stone and nothing else move but the cold sea rippling like galvanize and the nail holes of stars in the sky roof, till a wind start to interfere with the trees. i pass me dry neighbor sweeping she yard as i went downhill, and i nearly said: “sweep soft, you witch, ’cause she don’t sleep hard,” but the bitch look through me like i was dead. a route taxi pull up, park-lights still on. the driver size up my bags with a grin: “this time, shabine, like you really gone!” i ain’t answer the ass, i simply pile in the back seat and watch the sky burn above laventille pink as the gown in which the woman i left was sleeping, and i look in the rearview and see a man exactly like me, and the man was weeping for the houses, the streets, that whole fucking island.  christ have mercy on all sleeping things! from that dog rotting down wrightson road to when i was a dog on these streets; if loving these islands must be my load, out of corruption my soul takes wings. but they had started to poison my soul with their big house, big car, big-time bohbohl, coolie, nigger, syrian, and french creole, so i leave it for them and their carnival— i taking a sea bath, i gone down the road. i know these islands from monos to nassau, a rusty head sailor with sea-green eyes that they nickname shabine, the patois for any red nigger, and i, shabine, saw when these slums of empire was paradise. i’m just a red nigger who love the sea, i had a sound colonial education, i have dutch, nigger, and english in me, and either i’m nobody, or i’m a nation,  but maria concepcion was all my thought watching the sea heaving up and down as the port side of dories, schooners, and yachts was painted afresh by the strokes of the sun signing her name with every reflection; i knew when dark-haired evening put on her bright silk at sunset, and, folding the sea, sidled under the sheet with her starry laugh, that there’d be no rest, there’d be no forgetting. is like telling mourners round the graveside about resurrection, they want the dead back, so i smile to myself as the bow rope untied and the flight swing seaward: “is no use repeating that the sea have more fish. i ain’t want her dressed in the sexless light of a seraph, i want those round brown eyes like a marmoset, and till the day when i can lean back and laugh, those claws that tickled my back on sweating sunday afternoons, like a crab on wet sand.” as i worked, watching the rotting waves come past the bow that scissor the sea like silk, i swear to you all, by my mother’s milk, by the stars that shall fly from tonight’s furnace, that i loved them, my children, my wife, my home; i loved them as poets love the poetry that kills them, as drowned sailors the sea.  you ever look up from some lonely beach and see a far schooner? well, when i write this poem, each phrase go be soaked in salt; i go draw and knot every line as tight as ropes in this rigging; in simple speech my common language go be the wind, my pages the sails of the schooner flight. but let me tell you how this business begin.   2 raptures of the deep  smuggled scotch for o’hara, big government man, between cedros and the main, so the coast guard couldn’t touch us, and the spanish pirogues always met us halfway, but a voice kept saying: “shabine, see this business of playing pirate?” well, so said, so done! that whole racket crash. and i for a woman, for her laces and silks, maria concepcion. ay, ay! next thing i hear, some commission of inquiry was being organized to conduct a big quiz, with himself as chairman investigating himself. well, i knew damn well who the suckers would be, not that shark in shark skin, but his pilot fish, khaki-pants red niggers like you and me. what worse, i fighting with maria concepcion, plates flying and thing, so i swear: “not again!” it was mashing up my house and my family. i was so broke all i needed was shades and a cup or four shades and four cups in four-cup port of spain; all the silver i had was the coins on the sea.  you saw them ministers in the express, guardians of the poor—one hand at their back, and one set o’ police only guarding their house, and the scotch pouring in through the back door. as for that minister-monster who smuggled the booze, that half-syrian saurian, i got so vex to see that face thick with powder, the warts, the stone lids like a dinosaur caked with primordial ooze by the lightning of flashbulbs sinking in wealth, that i said: “shabine, this is shit, understand!” but he get somebody to kick my crutch out his office like i was some artist! that bitch was so grand, couldn’t get off his high horse and kick me himself. i have seen things that would make a slave sick in this trinidad, the limers’ republic.  i couldn’t shake the sea noise out of my head, the shell of my ears sang maria concepcion, so i start salvage diving with a crazy mick, name o’shaugnessy, and a limey named head; but this caribbean so choke with the dead that when i would melt in emerald water, whose ceiling rippled like a silk tent, i saw them corals: brain, fire, sea fans, dead-men’s-fingers, and then, the dead men. i saw that the powdery sand was their bones ground white from senegal to san salvador, so, i panic third dive, and surface for a month in the seamen’s hostel. fish broth and sermons. when i thought of the woe i had brought my wife, when i saw my worries with that other woman, i wept under water, salt seeking salt, for her beauty had fallen on me like a sword cleaving me from my children, flesh of my flesh!  there was this barge from st. vincent, but she was too deep to float her again. when we drank, the limey got tired of my sobbing for maria concepcion. he said he was getting the bends. good for him! the pain in my heart for maria concepcion, the hurt i had done to my wife and children, was worse than the bends. in the rapturous deep there was no cleft rock where my soul could hide like the boobies each sunset, no sandbar of light where i could rest, like the pelicans know, so i got raptures once, and i saw god like a harpooned grouper bleeding, and a far voice was rumbling, “shabine, if you leave her, if you leave her, i shall give you the morning star.” when i left the madhouse i tried other women but, once they stripped naked, their spiky cunts bristled like sea eggs and i couldn’t dive. the chaplain came round. i paid him no mind. where is my rest place, jesus? where is my harbor? where is the pillow i will not have to pay for, and the window i can look from that frames my life?   3 shabine leaves the republic  i had no nation now but the imagination. after the white man, the niggers didn’t want me when the power swing to their side. the first chain my hands and apologize, “history”; the next said i wasn’t black enough for their pride. tell me, what power, on these unknown rocks— a spray-plane air force, the fire brigade, the red cross, the regiment, two, three police dogs that pass before you finish bawling “parade!”? i met history once, but he ain’t recognize me, a parchment creole, with warts like an old sea bottle, crawling like a crab through the holes of shadow cast by the net of a grille balcony; cream linen, cream hat. i confront him and shout, “sir, is shabine! they say i’se your grandson. you remember grandma, your black cook, at all?” the bitch hawk and spat. a spit like that worth any number of words. but that’s all them bastards have left us: words.  i no longer believed in the revolution. i was losing faith in the love of my woman. i had seen that moment aleksandr blok crystallize in the twelve. was between the police marine branch and hotel venezuelana one sunday at noon. young men without flags using shirts, their chests waiting for holes. they kept marching into the mountains, and their noise ceased as foam sinks into sand. they sank in the bright hills like rain, every one with his own nimbus, leaving shirts in the street, and the echo of power at the end of the street. propeller-blade fans turn over the senate; the judges, they say, still sweat in carmine, on frederick street the idlers all marching by standing still, the budget turns a new leaf. in the 12:30 movies the projectors best not break down, or you go see revolution. aleksandr blok enters and sits in the third row of pit eating choc- olate cone, waiting for a spaghetti west- ern with clint eastwood and featuring lee van cleef.   4 the flight,passing blanchisseuse  dusk. the flight passing blanchisseuse. gulls wheel like. from a gun again, and foam gone amber that was white, lighthouse and star start making friends, down every beach the long day ends, and there, on that last stretch of sand, on a beach bare of all but light, dark hands start pulling in the seine of the dark sea, deep, deep inland.   5 shabine encounters the middle passage  man, i brisk in the galley first thing next dawn, brewing li’l coffee; fog coil from the sea like the kettle steaming when i put it down slow, slow, ’cause i couldn’t believe what i see: where the horizon was one silver haze, the fog swirl and swell into sails, so close that i saw it was sails, my hair grip my skull, it was horrors, but it was beautiful. we float through a rustling forest of ships with sails dry like paper, behind the glass i saw men with rusty eyeholes like cannons, and whenever their half-naked crews cross the sun, right through their tissue, you traced their bones like leaves against the sunlight; frigates, barkentines, the backward-moving current swept them on, and high on their decks i saw great admirals, rodney, nelson, de grasse, i heard the hoarse orders they gave those shabines, and that forest of masts sail right through the flight, and all you could hear was the ghostly sound of waves rustling like grass in a low wind and the hissing weeds they trailed from the stern; slowly they heaved past from east to west like this round world was some cranked water wheel, every ship pouring like a wooden bucket dredged from the deep; my memory revolve on all sailors before me, then the sun heat the horizon’s ring and they was mist.  next we pass slave ships. flags of all nations, our fathers below deck too deep, i suppose, to hear us shouting. so we stop shouting. who knows who his grandfather is, much less his name? tomorrow our landfall will be the barbados.   6 the sailor sings back to the casuarinas  you see them on the low hills of barbados bracing like windbreaks, needles for hurricanes, trailing, like masts, the cirrus of torn sails; when i was green like them, i used to think those cypresses, leaning against the sea, that take the sea noise up into their branches, are not real cypresses but casuarinas. now captain just call them canadian cedars. but cedars, cypresses, or casuarinas, whoever called them so had a good cause, watching their bending bodies wail like women after a storm, when some schooner came home with news of one more sailor drowned again. once the sound “cypress” used to make more sense than the green “casuarinas,” though, to the wind whatever grief bent them was all the same, since they were trees with nothing else in mind but heavenly leaping or to guard a grave; but we live like our names and you would have to be colonial to know the difference, to know the pain of history words contain, to love those trees with an inferior love, and to believe: “those casuarinas bend like cypresses, their hair hangs down in rain like sailors’ wives. they’re classic trees, and we, if we live like the names our masters please, by careful mimicry might become men.”   7 the flight anchors in castries harbor  when the stars self were young over castries, i loved you alone and i loved the whole world. what does it matter that our lives are different? burdened with the loves of our different children? when i think of your young face washed by the wind and your voice that chuckles in the slap of the sea? the lights are out on la toc promontory, except for the hospital. across at vigie the marina arcs keep vigil. i have kept my own promise, to leave you the one thing i own, you whom i loved first: my poetry. we here for one night. tomorrow, the flight will be gone.   8 fight with the crew  it had one bitch on board, like he had me mark— that was the cook, some vincentian arse with a skin like a gommier tree, red peeling bark, and wash-out blue eyes; he wouldn’t give me a ease, like he feel he was white. had an exercise book, this same one here, that i was using to write my poetry, so one day this man snatch it from my hand, and start throwing it left and right to the rest of the crew, bawling out, “catch it,” and start mincing me like i was some hen because of the poems. some case is for fist, some case is for tholing pin, some is for knife— this one was for knife. well, i beg him first, but he keep reading, “o my children, my wife,” and playing he crying, to make the crew laugh; it move like a flying fish, the silver knife that catch him right in the plump of his calf, and he faint so slowly, and he turn more white than he thought he was. i suppose among men you need that sort of thing. it ain’t right but that’s how it is. there wasn’t much pain, just plenty blood, and vincie and me best friend, but none of them go fuck with my poetry again.   9 maria concepcion &amp; the book of dreams  the jet that was screeching over the flight was opening a curtain into the past. “dominica ahead!” “it still have caribs there.” “one day go be planes only, no more boat.” “vince, god ain’t make nigger to fly through the air.” “progress, shabine, that’s what it’s all about. progress leaving all we small islands behind.” i was at the wheel, vince sitting next to me gaffing. crisp, bracing day. a high-running sea. ”progress is something to ask caribs about. they kill them by millions, some in war, some by forced labor dying in the mines looking for silver, after that niggers; more progress. until i see definite signs that mankind change, vince, i ain’t want to hear. progress is history’s dirty joke. ask that sad green island getting nearer.” green islands, like mangoes pickled in brine. in such fierce salt let my wound be healed, me, in my freshness as a seafarer. that night, with the sky sparks frosty with fire, i ran like a carib through dominica, my nose holes choked with memory of smoke; i heard the screams of my burning children, i ate the brains of mushrooms, the fungi of devil’s parasols under white, leprous rocks; my breakfast was leaf mold in leaking forests, with leaves big as maps, and when i heard noise of the soldiers’ progress through the thick leaves, though my heart was bursting, i get up and ran through the blades of balisier sharper than spears; with the blood of my race, i ran, boy, i ran with moss-footed speed like a painted bird; then i fall, but i fall by an icy stream under cool fountains of fern, and a screaming parrot catch the dry branches and i drowned at last in big breakers of smoke; then when that ocean of black smoke pass, and the sky turn white, there was nothing but progress, if progress is an iguana as still as a young leaf in sunlight. i bawl for maria, and her book of dreams.  it anchored her sleep, that insomniac’s bible, a soiled orange booklet with a cyclop’s eye center, from the dominican republic. its coarse pages were black with the usual symbols of prophecy, in excited spanish; an open palm upright, sectioned and numbered like a butcher chart, delivered the future. one night; in a fever, radiantly ill, she say, “bring me the book, the end has come.” she said: “i dreamt of whales and a storm,” but for that dream, the book had no answer. a next night i dreamed of three old women featureless as silkworms, stitching my fate, and i scream at them to come out my house, and i try beating them away with a broom, but as they go out, so they crawl back again, until i start screaming and crying, my flesh raining with sweat, and she ravage the book for the dream meaning, and there was nothing; my nerves melt like a jellyfish—that was when i broke— they found me round the savannah, screaming:  all you see me talking to the wind, so you think i mad. well, shabine has bridled the horses of the sea; you see me watching the sun till my eyeballs seared, so all you mad people feel shabine crazy, but all you ain’t know my strength, hear? the coconuts standing by in their regiments in yellow khaki, they waiting for shabine to take over these islands, and all you best dread the day i am healed of being a human. all you fate in my hand, ministers, businessmen, shabine have you, friend, i shall scatter your lives like a handful of sand, i who have no weapon but poetry and the lances of palms and the sea’s shining shield!   10 out of the depths  next day, dark sea. a arse-aching dawn. “damn wind shift sudden as a woman mind.” the slow swell start cresting like some mountain range with snow on the top. “ay, skipper, sky dark!” “this ain’t right for august.” “this light damn strange, this season, sky should be clear as a field.”  a stingray steeplechase across the sea, tail whipping water, the high man-o’-wars start reeling inland, quick, quick an archery of flying fish miss us! vince say: “you notice?” and a black-mane squall pounce on the sail like a dog on a pigeon, and it snap the neck of the flight and shake it from head to tail. “be jesus, i never see sea get so rough so fast! that wind come from god back pocket!” “where cap’n headin? like the man gone blind!” “if we’s to drong, we go drong, vince, fock-it!” “shabine, say your prayers, if life leave you any!”  i have not loved those that i loved enough. worse than the mule kick of kick-’em-jenny channel, rain start to pelt the flight between mountains of water. if i was frighten? the tent poles of water spouts bracing the sky start wobbling, clouds unstitch at the seams and sky water drench us, and i hear myself cry, “i’m the drowned sailor in her book of dreams.” i remembered them ghost ships, i saw me corkscrewing to the sea bed of sea worms, fathom pass fathom, my jaw clench like a fist, and only one thing hold me, trembling, how my family safe home. then a strength like it seize me and the strength said: “i from backward people who still fear god.” let him, in his might, heave leviathan upward by the winch of his will, the beast pouring lace from his sea-bottom bed; and that was the faith that had fade from a child in the methodist chapel in chisel street, castries, when the whale-bell sang service and, in hard pews ribbed like the whale, proud with despair, we sang how our race survive the sea’s maw, our history, our peril, and now i was ready for whatever death will. but if that storm had strength, was in cap’n face, beard beading with spray, tears salting his eyes, crucify to his post, that nigger hold fast to that wheel, man, like the cross held jesus, and the wounds of his eyes like they crying for us, and i feeding him white rum, while every crest with leviathan-lash make the flight quail like two criminal. whole night, with no rest, till red-eyed like dawn, we watch our travail subsiding, subside, and there was no more storm. and the noon sea get calm as thy kingdom come.   11 after the storm  there’s a fresh light that follows a storm while the whole sea still havoc; in its bright wake i saw the veiled face of maria concepcion marrying the ocean, then drifting away in the widening lace of her bridal train with white gulls her bridesmaids, till she was gone. i wanted nothing after that day. across my own face, like the face of the sun, a light rain was falling, with the sea calm.  fall gently, rain, on the sea’s upturned face like a girl showering; make these islands fresh as shabine once knew them! let every trace, every hot road, smell like clothes she just press and sprinkle with drizzle. i finish dream; whatever the rain wash and the sun iron: the white clouds, the sea and sky with one seam, is clothes enough for my nakedness. though my flight never pass the incoming tide of this inland sea beyond the loud reefs of the final bahamas, i am satisfied if my hand gave voice to one people’s grief. open the map. more islands there, man, than peas on a tin plate, all different size, one thousand in the bahamas alone, from mountains to low scrub with coral keys, and from this bowsprit, i bless every town, the blue smell of smoke in hills behind them, and the one small road winding down them like twine to the roofs below; i have only one theme:  the bowsprit, the arrow, the longing, the lunging heart— the flight to a target whose aim we’ll never know, vain search for one island that heals with its harbor and a guiltless horizon, where the almond’s shadow doesn’t injure the sand. there are so many islands! as many islands as the stars at night on that branched tree from which meteors are shaken like falling fruit around the schooner flight. but things must fall, and so it always was, on one hand venus, on the other mars; fall, and are one, just as this earth is one island in archipelagoes of stars. my first friend was the sea. now, is my last. i stop talking now. i work, then i read, cotching under a lantern hooked to the mast. i try to forget what happiness was, and when that don’t work, i study the stars. sometimes is just me, and the soft-scissored foam as the deck turn white and the moon open a cloud like a door, and the light over me is a road in white moonlight taking me home. shabine sang to you from the depths of the sea.

 there will be no edges, but curves. clean lines pointing only forward.  history, with its hard spine &amp; dog-eared corners, will be replaced with nuance,  just like the dinosaurs gave way to mounds and mounds of ice.  women will still be women, but the distinction will be empty. sex,  having outlived every threat, will gratify only the mind, which is where it will exist.  for kicks, we'll dance for ourselves before mirrors studded with golden bulbs.  the oldest among us will recognize that glow— but the word sun will have been re-assigned  to the standard uranium-neutralizing device found in households and nursing homes.  and yes, we'll live to be much older, thanks to popular consensus. weightless, unhinged,  eons from even our own moon, we'll drift in the haze of space, which will be, once  and for all, scrutable and safe.

 of course i chose the terry cloth surrogate. milkless artifice. false idol. everyone, i’m told, has a mother,  but master bred me in a laboratory, his colony of orphans. rhesus macaque.macaca mulatta. old world monkeys, my matriarchs ruled the grasslands  and forests long before white men like him weaned their whiteness and maleness from our chromosomes,  slashed and burned our home, what they once called the orient. french indochina. việt nam. master, like a good despot, besotted and dumbstruck, dying  to discern the genesis of allegiance, the science of love and loss, nature versus nurture, segregated me at birth  from my maker, pelt sopping with placental blood. in a chamber where he kept track of me, his pupils recorded my every movement, my every utterance,  hoping i might evince to them a part of themselves. but i wasn’t stupid. i knew famine and emaciation,  and nevertheless i picked that lifeless piece of shit because it was soft to hold. who wouldn’t want that? though it couldn’t hold me, i clung to the yellow-face  devil as though it was my true mother and i grasped the function of motherhood: witness to my suffering,  companion in hell. unlike infants with wire mothers i didn’t hurl myself on the floor in terror or tantrum, rocking back and forth, colder than a corpse. i had  what master believed to be a psychological base of operations. emotional attachment. autonomy.  everything he denied and did to me, his ceaseless cruelty concealed as inquisition, unthinkable until it was thought, i endured by keeping for myself  the wisdom he yearned to discover and take credit for. love, like me, is a beast no master can maim,  no dungeon can discipline. love is at once master and dungeon. so don’t underestimate me. simple- minded and subservient as i might appear to be,  i gathered more about master than he did about me, which, i guess, is a kind of fidelity  conceived not from fondness but fear magnified by fascination. master made me his terry cloth surrogate, his red-clawed god, nursing his id  on my tits, and for that, i pitied him. all this time he was the animal. all this time he belonged to me.

 crash on crash of the sea, straining to wreck men; sea-boards, continents, raging against the world, furious, stay at last, for against your fury and your mad fight, the line of heroes stands, godlike:  akroneos, oknolos, elatreus, helm-of-boat, loosener-of-helm, dweller-by-sea, nauteus, sea-man, prumneos, stern-of-ship, agchilalos, sea-girt, elatreus, oar-shaft: lover-of-the-sea, lover-of-the-sea-ebb, lover-of-the-swift-sea, ponteus, proreus, oöos: anabesneos, who breaks to anger as a wave to froth: amphiolos, one caught between wave-shock and wave-shock: eurualos, board sea-wrack, like ares, man’s death, and naubolidos, best in shape, of all first in size: phaekous, sea’s thunderbolt— ah, crash on crash of great names— man-tamer, man’s-help, perfect laodamos: and last the sons of great alkinöos, laodamos, halios, and god-like clytomeos.  of all nations, of all cities, of all continents, she is favoured above the rest, for she gives men as great as the sea, to battle against the elements and evil: greater even than the sea, they live beyond wrack and death of cities, and each god-like name spoken is as a shrine in a godless place.  but to name you, we, reverent, are breathless, weak with pain and old loss, and exile and despair— our hearts break but to speak your name, oknaleos— and may we but call you in the feverish wrack of our storm-strewn beach, eretmeos, our hurt is quiet and our hearts tamed, as the sea may yet be tamed, and we vow to float great ships, named for each hero, and oar-blades, cut of mountain-trees as such men might have shaped: eretmeos, and the sea is swept, baffled by the lordly shape, akroneos has pines for his ship’s keel; to love, to mate the sea? ah there is ponteos, the very deep roar, hailing you dear— they clamour to ponteos, and to proëos leap, swift to kiss, to curl, to creep, lover to mistress.  what wave, what love, what foam, for oöos who moves swift as the sea? ah stay, my heart, the weight of lovers, of loneliness drowns me, alas that their very names so press to break my heart with heart-sick weariness, what would they be, the very gods, rearing their mighty length beside the unharvested sea?  
NEW POEM
 rose, harsh rose, marred and with stint of petals, meagre flower, thin, sparse of leaf,  more precious than a wet rose single on a stem— you are caught in the drift.  stunted, with small leaf, you are flung on the sand, you are lifted in the crisp sand that drives in the wind.  can the spice-rose drip such acrid fragrance hardened in a leaf?  
NEW POEM
 as rising from the vegetable world my theme ascends, with equal wing ascend, my panting muse; and hark, how loud the woods invite you forth in all your gayest trim. lend me your song, ye nightingales! oh pour the mazy-running soul of melody into my varied verse! while i deduce, from the first note the hollow cuckoo sings, the symphony of spring, and touch a theme unknown to fame, the passion of the groves.   when first the soul of love is sent abroad, warm thro the vital air, and on the heart harmonious seizes, the gay troops begin, in gallant thought, to plume the painted wing; and try again the long-forgotten strain, at first faint-warbled. but no sooner grows the soft infusion prevalent, and wide, than, all alive, at once their joy o’erflows in musick unconfin’d. up-springs the lark, shrill-voic’d, and loud, the messenger of morn; ere yet the shadows fly, he mounted sings amid the dawning clouds, and from their haunts calls up the tuneful nations. every copse deep-tangled, tree irregular, and bush bending with dewy moisture, o’er the heads of the coy quiristers that lodge within, are prodigal of harmony. the thrush and wood-lark, o’er the kind contending throng superior heard, run thro’ the sweetest length of notes; when listening philomela deigns to let them joy, and purposes, in thought elate, to make her night excel their day. the black-bird whistles from the thorny brake; the mellow bullfinch answers from the grove: nor are the linnets, o’er the flow’ring furze pour’d out profusely, silent. join’d to these innumerous songsters, in the freshening shade of new-sprung leaves, their modulations mix mellifluous. the jay, the rook, the daw, and each harsh pipe discordant heard alone, aid the full concert: while the stock-dove breathes a melancholy murmur thro’ the whole.  ’tis love creates their melody, and all this waste of music is the voice of love; that even to birds, and beasts, the tender arts of pleasing teaches. hence the glossy kind try every winning way inventive love can dictate, and in courtship to their mates pour forth their little souls. first, wide around, with distant awe, in airy rings they rove, endeavouring by a thousand tricks to catch the cunning, conscious, half-averted glance of their regardless charmer. should she seem softening the least approvance to bestow, their colours burnish, and by hope inspir’d, they brisk advance; then, on a sudden struck, retire disorder’d; then again approach; in fond rotation spread the spotted wing, and shiver every feather with desire.  connubial leagues agreed, to the deep woods they haste away, all as their fancy leads, pleasure, or food, or secret safety prompts; that nature’s great command may be obey’d, nor all the sweet sensations they perceive indulg’d in vain. some to the holly-hedge nestling repair, and to the thicket some; some to the rude protection of the thorn commit their feeble offspring. the cleft tree offers its kind concealment to a few, their food its insects, and its moss their nests. others apart far in the grassy dale, or roughening waste, their humble texture weave. but most in woodland solitudes delight, in unfrequented glooms, or shaggy banks, steep, and divided by a babbling brook, whose murmurs soothe them all the live-long day, when by kind duty fix’d. among the roots of hazel, pendant o’er the plaintive stream, they frame the first foundation of their domes; dry sprigs of trees, in artful fabrick laid, and bound with clay together. now ’tis nought but restless hurry thro the busy air, beat by unnumer’d wings. the swallow sweeps the slimy pool, to build his hanging house intent. and often, from the careless back of herds and flocks, a thousand tugging bills pluck hair and wool; and oft, when unobserv’d, steal from the barn a straw: till soft and warm, clean, and compleat, their habitation grows.  as thus the patient dam assiduous sits, not to be tempted from her tender task, or by sharp hunger, or by smooth delight, tho the whole loosen’d spring around her blows, her sympathizing lover takes his stand high on th’ opponent bank, and ceaseless sings the tedious time away; or else supplies her place a moment, while she sudden flits to pick the scanty meal. th’ appointed time with pious toil fulfill’d, the callow young, warm’d and expanded into perfect life, their brittle bondage break, and come to light, a helpless family, demanding food with constant clamour. o what passions then, what melting sentiments of kindly care, on the new parents seize! away they fly affectionate, and undesiring bear the most delicious morsel to their young, which equally distributed, again the search begins. even so a gentle pair, by fortune sunk, but form’d of generous mold, and charm’d with cares beyond the vulgar breast, in some lone cott amid the distant woods, sustain’d alone by providential heaven , oft, as they weeping eye their infant train, check their own appetites and give them all.  nor toil alone they scorn: exalting love, by the great father of the spring inspir’d, gives instant courage to the fearful race, and to the simple art. with stealthy wing, should some rude foot their woody haunts molest, amid a neighbouring bush they silent drop, and whirring thence, as if alarm’d, deceive th’ unfeeling school-boy. hence, around the head of wandering swain, the white-wing’d plover wheels her sounding flight, and then directly on in long excursion skims the level lawn, to tempt him from her nest. the wild-duck, hence, o’er the rough moss, and o’er the trackless waste the heath-hen flutters, (pious fraud!) to lead the hot pursuing spaniel far astray.  be not the muse asham’d, here to bemoan her brothers of the grove, by tyrant man inhuman caught, and in the narrow cage from liberty confin’d, and boundless air. dull are the pretty slaves, their plumage dull, ragged, and all its brightening lustre lost; nor is that sprightly wildness in their notes, which, clear and vigorous, warbles from the beech. oh then, ye friends of love and love-taught song, spare the soft tribes, this barbarous art forbear! if on your bosom innocence can win, music engage, or piety persuade.  but let not chief the nightingale lament her ruin’d care, too delicately fram’d to brook the harsh confinement of the cage. oft when, returning with her loaded bill, th’ astonish’d mother finds a vacant nest, by the hard hand of unrelenting clowns robb’d, to the ground the vain provision falls; her pinions ruffle, and low-drooping scarce can bear the mourner to the poplar shade; where, all abandon’d to despair, she sings her sorrows thro the night; and, on the bough, sole-sitting, still at every dying fall takes up again her lamentable strain of winding woe; till wide around the woods sigh to her song, and with her wail resound.  but now the feather’d youth their former bounds, ardent, disdain; and, weighing oft their wings, demand the free possession of the sky. this one glad office more, and then dissolves parental love at once, now needless grown. unlavish wisdom never works in vain. ’tis on some evening, sunny, grateful, mild, when nought but balm is breathing thro the woods, with yellow lustre bright, that the new tribes visit the spacious heavens, and look abroad on nature’s common, far as they can see, or wing, their range, and pasture. o’er the boughs dancing about, still at the giddy verge their resolution fails; their pinions till, in loose libration stretch’d, to trust the void trembling refuse: till down before them fly the parent-guides, and chide, exhort, command, or push them off. the surging air receives the plumy burden; and their self-taught wings winnow the waving element. on ground alighted, bolder up again they lead, farther and farther on, the lengthening flight; till vanish’d every fear, and every power rouz’d into life and action, light in air th’ acquitted parents see their soaring race, and once rejoicing never know them more.  
NEW POEM
 when descends on the atlantic the gigantic storm-wind of the equinox, landward in his wrath he scourges the toiling surges, laden with seaweed from the rocks:  from bermuda's reefs; from edges of sunken ledges, in some far-off, bright azore; from bahama, and the dashing, silver-flashing surges of san salvador;  from the tumbling surf, that buries the orkneyan skerries, answering the hoarse hebrides; and from wrecks of ships, and drifting spars, uplifting on the desolate, rainy seas; —  ever drifting, drifting, drifting on the shifting currents of the restless main; till in sheltered coves, and reaches of sandy beaches, all have found repose again.  so when storms of wild emotion strike the ocean of the poet's soul, erelong from each cave and rocky fastness, in its vastness, floats some fragment of a song:  from the far-off isles enchanted, heaven has planted with the golden fruit of truth; from the flashing surf, whose vision gleams elysian in the tropic clime of youth;  from the strong will, and the endeavor that forever wrestle with the tides of fate; from the wreck of hopes far-scattered, tempest-shattered, floating waste and desolate; —  ever drifting, drifting, drifting on the shifting currents of the restless heart; till at length in books recorded, they, like hoarded household words, no more depart.

 achilles slays the man who slayed his friend, pierces the corpse behind the heels and drags it behind his chariot like the cans that trail a bride and groom. then he lays out a banquet for his men, oxen and goats and pigs and sheep; the soldiers eat until a greasy moonbeam lights their beards.  the first slaughter is for victory, but the second slaughter is for grief—

 it started about noon.  on top of mount batte, we were all exclaiming.  someone had a cardboard and a pin, and we all cried out when the sun appeared in tiny form on the notebook cover.  it was hard to believe.  the high school teacher we’d met called it a pinhole camera, people in the renaissance loved to do that. and when the moon had passed partly through  we saw on a rock underneath a fir tree, dozens of crescents—made the same way— thousands!  even our straw hats produced a few as we moved them over the bare granite.  we shared chocolate, and one man from maine told a joke.  suns were everywhere—at our feet.  
NEW POEM
 departing summer hath assumed an aspect tenderly illumed, the gentlest look of spring; that calls from yonder leafy shade unfaded, yet prepared to fade, a timely carolling.  no faint and hesitating trill, such tribute as to winter chill the lonely redbreast pays! clear, loud, and lively is the din, from social warblers gathering in their harvest of sweet lays.  nor doth the example fail to cheer me, conscious that my leaf is sere, and yellow on the bough:— fall, rosy garlands, from my head! ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed around a younger brow!  yet will i temperately rejoice; wide is the range, and free the choice of undiscordant themes; which, haply, kindred souls may prize not less than vernal ecstasies, and passion's feverish dreams.  for deathless powers to verse belong, and they like demi-gods are strong on whom the muses smile; but some their function have disclaimed, best pleased with what is aptliest framed to enervate and defile.  not such the initiatory strains committed to the silent plains in britain's earliest dawn: trembled the groves, the stars grew pale, while all-too-daringly the veil of nature was withdrawn!  nor such the spirit-stirring note when the live chords alcæus smote, inflamed by sense of wrong; woe! woe to tyrants! from the lyre broke threateningly, in sparkles dire of fierce vindictive song.  and not unhallowed was the page by wingèd love inscribed, to assuage the pangs of vain pursuit; love listening while the lesbian maid with finest touch of passion swayed her own æolian lute.  o ye, who patiently explore the wreck of herculanean lore, what rapture! could ye seize some theban fragment, or unroll one precious, tender-hearted scroll of pure simonides.  that were, indeed, a genuine birth of poesy; a bursting forth of genius from the dust: what horace gloried to behold, what maro loved, shall we enfold? can haughty time be just!  
NEW POEM
 lyric night of the lingering indian summer, shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing, never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects, ceaseless, insistent.  the grasshopper’s horn, and far-off, high in the maples, the wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence under a moon waning and worn, broken, tired with summer.  let me remember you, voices of little insects, weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters, let me remember, soon will the winter be on us, snow-hushed and heavy.  over my soul murmur your mute benediction, while i gaze, o fields that rest after harvest, as those who part look long in the eyes they lean to, lest they forget them.

 the whiskey stink of rot has settled in the garden, and a burst of fruit flies rises when i touch the dying tomato plants.  still, the claws of tiny yellow blossoms flail in the air as i pull the vines up by the roots and toss them in the compost.  it feels cruel. something in me isn’t ready to let go of summer so easily. to destroy what i’ve carefully cultivated all these months. those pale flowers might still have time to fruit.  my great-grandmother sang with the girls of her village as they pulled the flax. songs so old and so tied to the season that the very sound seemed to turn the weather.

 i that was i, you heard last night, when there rose no moon at all, nor, to pierce the strained and tight tent of heaven, a planet small: life was dead and so was light.  ii not a twinkle from the fly, not a glimmer from the worm; when the crickets stopped their cry, when the owls forbore a term, you heard music; that was i.  iii earth turned in her sleep with pain, sultrily suspired for proof: in at heaven and out again, lightning! —- where it broke the roof, bloodlike, some few drops of rain.  iv what they could my words expressed, o my love, my all, my one! singing helped the verses best, and when singing's best was done, to my lute i left the rest.  v so wore night; the east was gray, white the broad-faced hemlock-flowers: there would be another day; ere its first of heavy hours found me, i had passed away.  vi what became of all the hopes, words and song and lute as well? say, this struck you —- "when life gropes feebly for the path where fell light last on the evening slopes,  vii "one friend in that path shall be, to secure my step from wrong; one to count night day for me, patient through the watches long, serving most with none to see."  viii never say —- as something bodes —- "so, the worst has yet a worse! when life halts 'neath double loads, better the taskmaster's curse than such music on the roads!  ix "when no moon succeeds the sun, nor can pierce the midnight's tent any star, the smallest one, while some drops, where lightning rent, show the final storm begun —-  x "when the fire-fly hides its spot, when the garden-voices fail in the darkness thick and hot, —- shall another voice avail, that shape be where these are not?  xi "has some plague a longer lease, proffering its help uncouth? can't one even die in peace? as one shuts one's eyes on youth, is that face the last one sees?"  xii oh how dark your villa was, windows fast and obdurate! how the garden grudged me grass where i stood —- the iron gate ground its teeth to let me pass!

 we speak of mankind. why not wavekind?  barrel-chested military water rushes in a mass to break the shore earth into stonekind.  pphlooph pphlooph the waves grope indistinctly for the shore.  as delicate as a butterfly along a cheek a boat with white and orange sail appears. a small boy in a life-belt sits in front and looks ahead with all his might. his father steers, attached like a shaft to his son’s safety and the sail’s management.  a sunfish thrown back by a fisherman lies drowned and pitching. the eyes are white in death.  this is the raw data. a mystery translates it into feeling and perception; then imagination; finally the hard inevitable quartz figure of will and language. thus a squirrel tail flying from a handlebar unmistakably establishes its passing rider as a male unbowed in a chipper plume.  
NEW POEM
 so the tide forgets, as morning grows too far delivered, as the bowls of rock and wood run dry. what is left seems pearled and lit, as those cases of the museum stood lit with milk jade, rows of opaque vases streaked with orange and yellow smoke. you found a lavender boat, a single figure poling upstream, baskets of pale fish wedged between his legs. today, the debris of winter stands stacked against the walls, the coils of kelp lie scattered across the floor. the oil fire smokes. you turn down the lantern hung on its nail. outside, the boats aligned like sentinels. here beside the blue depot, walking the pier, you can see the way the shore approximates the dream, how distances repeat their deaths above these tables and panes of water— as climbing the hills above the harbor, up to the lupine drifting among the lichen-masked pines, the night is pocked with lamps lit on every boat offshore, galleries of floating stars. below, on its narrow tracks shelved into the cliff’s face, the train begins its slide down to the warehouses by the harbor. loaded with diesel, coal, paychecks, whiskey, bedsheets, slabs of ice—for the fish, for the men. you lean on my arm, as once i watched you lean at the window; the bookstalls below stretched a mile to the quay, the afternoon crowd picking over the novels and histories. you walked out as you walked out last night, onto the stone porch. dusk reddened the walls, the winds sliced off the reefs. the vines of the gourds shook on their lattice. you talked about that night you stood behind the black pane of the french window, watching my father read some long passage of a famous voyager’s book. you hated that voice filling the room, its light. so tonight we make a soft parenthesis upon the sand’s black bed. in that dream we share, there is one shore, where we look out upon nothing and the sea our whole lives; until turning from those waves, we find one shore, where we look out upon nothing and the earth our whole lives. where what is left between shore and sky is traced in the vague wake of (the stars, the sandpipers whistling) what we forgive.if you wake soon, wake me.

 thanksgiving, dark of the moon. nothing down here in the underworld but vague shapes and black holes, heaven resplendent but virtual above me, trees stripped and triple-wired like irish harps. lights on pantops and free bridge mirror the eastern sky. under the bridge is the river, the red rivanna. under the river’s redemption, it says in the book, it says in the book, through water and fire the whole place becomes purified, the visible by the visible, the hidden by what is hidden.

 oh happy shades—to me unblest! friendly to peace, but not to me! how ill the scene that offers rest, and heart that cannot rest, agree!  this glassy stream, that spreading pine, those alders quiv'ring to the breeze, might sooth a soul less hurt than mine, and please, if any thing could please.  but fix'd unalterable care foregoes not what she feels within, shows the same sadness ev'rywhere, and slights the season and the scene.  for all that pleas'd in wood or lawn, while peace possess'd these silent bow'rs, her animating smile withdrawn, has lost its beauties and its pow'rs.  the saint or moralist should tread this moss-grown alley, musing, slow; they seek, like me, the secret shade, but not, like me, to nourish woe!  me fruitful scenes and prospects waste alike admonish not to roam; these tell me of enjoyments past, and those of sorrows yet to come.

 1 desert heat, high clouds, and sky the color of lapis. on this journey, anything seems possible, so we stop by an ancient cottonwood to kiss. the beauty trembles, doesn't say a word, just watches me, so open. small birds fly by, flock in the shady tree above us. what settles in her heart? what congeals? hope? despair? far off, the river churns in its sandy banks, swallows veer, turn in fiery air. will these kisses seal her to me? i her lover, she my wife? is all of this a dream, my whole life?  2 she is just this side of wonderful, and suddenly the glamorous world fills itself with shining and we laugh at highway monuments that explain how hard the trek had been for franciscans in the indian wilderness, poor fellows— conversion is the devil's own work! then the stones of her dream turn up under her feet, the back of a huge land turtle. i know we must be circling paradise because the ants enter the fleshy petals of the roadside flowers with evident joy and purpose (oh, my dark, pretty one).  3 music, my adored. when is there never music? my accordion puffs up with drinkable melodies. i spill her tunes into your listening ear, one after the other: the squeeze-box enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy with its hard rhythms, lilts the back- breaking labor song the worker croons to earth, warbles romantic notes of dissolving borders. you melt like a woman beneath her lover's touch. music is happy and pitiless when it sets fire to combustible souls. even the raspy bandoneon's voice is lyric.  4 sacred. sacred. sacred. sacred. (speak in a whisper.) we slip into this space half cognizant. the land is very large indeed: bones of the earth worn down, though she is a living thing. see how she exposes her grace? antelopes graze on the far plain—their high, white tails—the red soil throbs its slow heartbeat, and the blue sky clears so smartly, perfectly, like radiance. are the ancestors near? what can we know? we decide to wander around this prairie, mistaken for utes, buy commodities in little towns.  5 late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked malheur after the long curve of the snake river plain. (above the falls where the shoshone went to pray we soaked our feet in cold water, and i observed the arch of her brown foot.) rabbitbrush and sage along the highway, juniper on far hills and bluffs. sundown, and dusk falls over the wide basin of land. in burns we eat eggs in a cafe, take a room in the motel 6. in the dark, i can see her black hair, black against the pillows. its clean scent makes me think of corn. at dawn, i hold her and there are kisses. then more kisses. then more. the day is cold; a north wind blew last night. but the land is open. rain falls in showers of light.  6 her hand on my thigh, my shoulder, in my hair. she leans over to kiss my cheek. we look at each other, smile. for miles we travel this way, nearly silent, point with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king- fisher on the snag above the swollen creek. one night i weep in her arms as she cries,"oh, oh, oh!" because i have touched her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts. in that communion of lovers, thick sobs break from me as i think of my love back home, all that i have done and cannot say. this is the first time i have left her so completely, so alone.

 balmy overcast nights of late september; palms standing out in street light, house light; full moon penetrating the cloud-film with an explosive halo, a ring almost half the sky; air like a towel draped over shoulders; lightness or gravity deferred like a moral question; the incense in the house lit; the young people moving from the front door into the half-dark and back, or up the stairs to glimpse the lovers’ shoes outside the master bedroom; the youngest speculating; the taste of beer, familiar as salt water; each window holding a sea view, charcoal with shifting bars of white; the fog filling in like the haze of distance itself, pushing close, blurring.  as if the passage into life were through such houses, surrounded by some version of ocean weather, lit beads of fog or wind so stripped it burns the throat; mildew-spreading, spray-laden breezes and the beach sun making each grain of stucco cast a shadow; an ideal landscape sheared of its nostalgia; s. with his black hair, buck teeth, unsunned skin, joking and disappearing; f. doing exactly the same but dying, a corkscrew motion through green water; and c. not looking back from the car door, reappearing beside the east river, rich, owned, smiling at last.  swains. and nymphs. and news that came with the sea damp, of steady pipe-corrosions, black corners, moisture working through sand lots, through slab floors, slowly, with chemical, with molecular intricacy, then, bursting alive: the shrieked confessions of the wild parents; the cliff collapse; the kidnap; the cache of photos; the letter; the weapon; the haunted dream; the sudden close-up of the loved one’s degradation.  weather a part of it all, permeating and sanctifying, infiltrating and destroying; the sun disc, cool behind the veil of afternoon cloud, with sun spots like flies crawling across it; the slow empurpling of skin all summer; the glorious learned flesh and the rich pallor of the untouched places in the first nakedness; the working of the lesion now in late life, soon to be known by the body, even the one enduring the bareness of the inland plains, the cold fronts out of canada, a sickness for home that feels no different from health.  
NEW POEM
 it is easy to love a pig in a nightgown. see how he sleeps, white flannel straining his neck at the neckhole. his body swells and then deflates. the gown is nothing to be ashamed of, only the white clay of moonlight smeared over his hulk, original clothing, the milk of his loneliness. the flickering candle of a dream moves his warty eyelids. all sleeping things are children.  
NEW POEM
 a snake is the love of a thumb and forefinger. other times, an arm that has swallowed a bicep.  the air behind this one is like a knot in a child’s shoelace come undone while you were blinking.  it is bearing something away. what? what time does the next snake leave?  this one’s tail is ravelling into its burrow— a rosary returned to a purse. the snake is the last time your spine could go anywhere alone.  
NEW POEM
 for kathe izzo i was 6 and i lost my snake.  the table shook i can do better than this and shambled to the kitchen to the scene of the crime  i was green i put my sneaker down, little shoe  i felt the cold metal tap my calf  moo and everything began to change. i am 6 turned into lightning wrote on the night  at 6, i was feathers scales, i fell into the slime of it, lit  you think you are six, it yelled. i am face to face with a frog a woman alone in bed. the square of the window persists. i am 6.  the phone rings it’s my sister blamm i dropped a plate. sorry.  now the clouds slide by afraid, awake my feet are cold but i’m fearless  i am 6.  under here with bottle caps and stars adults and low moans, busses  slamming on brakes i am 6  the cake is lit it’s round the children sing. i will never return. we are so small.  my husband turns his fevered face. i put the medicine down. click. i am 6.  the movie rolls on. tramping feet, music blaring at the end of the war. i am frightened hold my hand  the round face of the woman upstairs, moving the faucets, strips of vegetable  slithering down, her reptile child will never return. the telephone rings. it’s me. i’m six.  
NEW POEM
 i  throughout the afternoon i watched them there, snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky, whirling fantastic in the misty air, contending fierce for space supremacy. and they flew down a mightier force at night, as though in heaven there was revolt and riot, and they, frail things had taken panic flight down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet. i went to bed and rose at early dawn to see them huddled together in a heap, each merged into the other upon the lawn, worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep. the sun shone brightly on them half the day, by night they stealthily had stol’n away.   ii  and suddenly my thoughts then turned to you who came to me upon a winter’s night, when snow-sprites round my attic window flew, your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light. my heart was like the weather when you came, the wanton winds were blowing loud and long; but you, with joy and passion all aflame, you danced and sang a lilting summer song. i made room for you in my little bed, took covers from the closet fresh and warm, a downful pillow for your scented head, and lay down with you resting in my arm. you went with dawn. you left me ere the day, the lonely actor of a dreamy play.

 the snow is melting and the village is flooded with children.  
NEW POEM
 one must have a mind of winter to regard the frost and the boughs of the pine-trees crusted with snow;  and have been cold a long time to behold the junipers shagged with ice, the spruces rough in the distant glitter  of the january sun; and not to think of any misery in the sound of the wind, in the sound of a few leaves,  which is the sound of the land full of the same wind that is blowing in the same bare place  for the listener, who listens in the snow, and, nothing himself, beholds nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.  
NEW POEM
 stand here by my side and turn, i pray, on the lake below, thy gentle eyes; the clouds hang over it, heavy and gray, and dark and silent the water lies; and out of that frozen mist the snow in wavering flakes begins to flow; flake after flake they sink in the dark and silent lake.  see how in a living swarm they come from the chambers beyond that misty veil; some hover awhile in air, and some rush prone from the sky like summer hail. all, dropping swiftly or settling slow, meet, and are still in the depths below; flake after flake dissolved in the dark and silent lake.  here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud, come floating downward in airy play, like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd that whiten by night the milky way; there broader and burlier masses fall; the sullen water buries them all– flake after flake– all drowned in the dark and silent lake.  and some, as on tender wings they glide from their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray, are joined in their fall, and, side by side, come clinging along their unsteady way; as friend with friend, or husband with wife, makes hand in hand the passage of life; each mated flake soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.  lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste stream down the snows, till the air is white, as, myriads by myriads madly chased, they fling themselves from their shadowy height. the fair, frail creatures of middle sky, what speed they make, with their grave so nigh; flake after flake, to lie in the dark and silent lake!  i see in thy gentle eyes a tear; they turn to me in sorrowful thought; thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear, who were for a time, and now are not; like these fair children of cloud and frost, that glisten a moment and then are lost, flake after flake– all lost in the dark and silent lake.  yet look again, for the clouds divide; a gleam of blue on the water lies; and far away, on the mountain-side, a sunbeam falls from the opening skies, but the hurrying host that flew between the cloud and the water, no more is seen; flake after flake, at rest in the dark and silent lake.  
NEW POEM
 announced by all the trumpets of the sky, arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields, seems nowhere to alight: the whited air hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven, and veils the farm-house at the garden's end. the sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit around the radiant fireplace, enclosed in a tumultuous privacy of storm.  come see the north wind's masonry. out of an unseen quarry evermore furnished with tile, the fierce artificer curves his white bastions with projected roof round every windward stake, or tree, or door. speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work so fanciful, so savage, nought cares he for number or proportion. mockingly, on coop or kennel he hangs parian wreaths; a swan-like form invests the hidden thorn; fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall, maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the gate, a tapering turret overtops the work. and when his hours are numbered, and the world is all his own, retiring, as he were not, leaves, when the sun appears, astonished art to mimic in slow structures, stone by stone, built in an age, the mad wind's night-work, the frolic architecture of the snow.  
NEW POEM
 a castaway blown south from the arctic tundra sits on a stump in an abandoned farmer’s field. beyond the dunes cattails toss and bend as snappy as the surf, rushing and crashing down the jetty.  his head a swivel of round glances, his eyes a deeper yellow than the winter sun, he wonders if the spot two hundred feet away is a mouse on the crawl from mud hole to deer-grass patch.  an hour of wind and sleet whips the air, nothing darts or passes but the river underground. a north pole creature shows us how to last. the wind ruffles his feathers from crown to claw  while he gazes into zeroes the salt-slick rain. as a double-rainbow before us arcs sky and owl, we leave him surrendering to the echo of his white refrain.  
NEW POEM
 no one home. snow packing the morning in. much white nothing filling up. a v of birds pulling the silence until some dog across the street barks, and breaks what i call my peace. what a luxury annoyance is. it bites off and keeps just enough of what i think i want to be endless.  
NEW POEM
 when the fog burns off and the air's pulverized diamonds and you can see beyond the islands of forever!—far too dramatic for me. it hurts something behind my eyes near the sphenoid, not good. i prefer fog with fog behind it, uninflammable fog. then there's no competition for brightness, no byron for your shelley, no juno eclisping your athena, no big bridge statement about bringing unity to landmasses. all the thought balloons are blank. the marching band can't practice, even a bird's got to get within five feet before it can start an argument. like dead flies on the sill of an abandoned nursery, we too are seeds in the rattle of mortality. a foglike baby god picks it up, shakes it, laughs insanely then goes back to playing with her feet. i have felt awful cold and lonely and fog has been blotting paper to my tears. my dog is fog and i don't have to scoop its poop with my hand in a plastic bag. there are sensations that begin in the world, the mind responding with ideas but then those ideas cause other sensations. what a mess. we stand at the edge of a drop that doesn't answer back, fog our only friend although it's hell on shrimpboats. there, there, says the fog. where, where? you can't see a thing.  
NEW POEM
 untitled, from the silueta series, 1980, by ana mendieta for ana mendieta    mud learns to live with mites, worms, beetles, and ticks.  and lioness digs up the earth where a warthog cowers in his den.  you know you are loved when she tears you to bits, brittle thing.  the lioness tongue softens you up all the way to her bottom.  roots, straw, weeds, rain your crown,hija de ochun.  even earth’s suffering arises from pangs of  love.  when lioness fangs diffuse the blood we call it liberation.  wax hisses from the smoldering wick, curtains you draw go shoosh.  the last earth imprint you ever left on asphalt from thirty floors up.  a shoe curved from the work your instep leaves behind.  the breath of the lioness heats up your shoulders and your neck.  a genetic photograph of every cell that ever lives exists in a lioness mouth.  she tears into the riverbed and root hairs clog her claws.  ancient bacteria get all up in you.  control the fire and it burns deeper, flashing life into sleeping embers.  
NEW POEM
 i  no riches from his scanty store my lover could impart; he gave a boon i valued more — he gave me all his heart!  ii  his soul sincere, his generous worth, might well this bosom move; and when i asked for bliss on earth, i only meant his love.  iii  but now for me, in search of gain from shore to shore he flies; why wander riches to obtain, when love is all i prize?  iv  the frugal meal, the lowly cot if blest my love with thee! that simple fare, that humble lot, were more than wealth to me.  v  while he the dangerous ocean braves, my tears but vainly flow: is pity in the faithless waves to which i pour my woe?  vi  the night is dark, the waters deep, yet soft the billows roll; alas! at every breeze i weep — the storm is in my soul.  
NEW POEM
 you are beadwork woven by a broken indian woman that i mend with cautious, needle-pricked fingers. you are raw sweetness of burning chaga scraping my lungs and startling tears. you are the bear claw necklace no longer caressing the space between my breasts. you are cigarettes that i quit years ago, but sometimes smoke anyways.  you are maple syrup on snow melting on my tongue until i ache from the cold. you are the cedar tree sheltering my childhood from unwanted caresses. you are the star blanket sliding off the bed on autumnal nights. you are a stubborn braid of wiingashk that must be relit with a dozen matches before it releases thin streamers of sweetness.  you are the love song played on a reedless flute that only spirits hear.  
NEW POEM
 memory, hither come, and tune your merry notes; and, while upon the wind, your music floats, i'll pore upon the stream, where sighing lovers dream, and fish for fancies as they pass within the watery glass.  i'll drink of the clear stream, and hear the linnet's song; and there i'll lie and dream the day along: and, when night comes, i'll go to places fit for woe, walking along the darken'd valley, with silent melancholy.  
NEW POEM
 it's never enough being one. why do i hope to contain you: always undoing and undone; every place you touch me changes shape. it's not my way to just lie down;  to sink, effaced and full. if you swallow me, you're drained, and half of us is gone. desire's fulfillment is two, not one, or our tidal meetings are through.  so hurl your wet force forward, sea, take me wave by wave. pearl maker, pull me deep; our one's a need, a momentary bliss. what i erect, you spill—  castles, boulders, cliffs. my love's endurance grain by grain; your adoration's rain. touch my bones, my canyon's carved evidence. even the moon who moves you is stone.  
NEW POEM
 sometimes i, i go about pitying myself while i am carried by the wind across the sky.  
NEW POEM
 (from love's labors lost ) when daisies pied and violets blue and lady-smocks all silver-white and cuckoo-buds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight, the cuckoo then, on every tree, mocks married men; for thus sings he: “cuckoo; cuckoo, cuckoo!” o, word of fear, unpleasing to a married ear!  when shepherds pipe on oaten straws, and merry larks are ploughmen's clocks, when turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, and maidens bleach their summer smocks, the cuckoo then, on every tree, mocks married men; for thus sings he, “cuckoo; cuckoo, cuckoo!” o, word of fear, unpleasing to a married ear!  when icicles hang by the wall, and dick the shepherd blows his nail, and tom bears logs into the hall, and milk comes frozen home in pail, when blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul, then nightly sings the staring-owl, “tu-who; tu-whit, tu-who!”—a merry note, while greasy joan doth keel the pot.  when all aloud the wind doth blow, and coughing drowns the parson's saw, and birds sit brooding in the snow, and marian's nose looks red and raw, when roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, then nightly sings the staring owl, “tu-who; tu-whit, tu-who!”—a merry note, while greasy joan doth keel the pot.  
NEW POEM
 (from twelfth night ) when that i was and a little tiny boy, with hey, ho, the wind and the rain, a foolish thing was but a toy, for the rain it raineth every day.  but when i came to man’s estate, with hey, ho, the wind and the rain, ’gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, for the rain it raineth every day.  but when i came, alas! to wive, with hey, ho, the wind and the rain, by swaggering could i never thrive, for the rain it raineth every day.  but when i came unto my beds, with hey, ho, the wind and the rain, with toss-pots still had drunken heads, for the rain it raineth every day.  a great while ago the world begun, with hey, ho, the wind and the rain, but that’s all one, our play is done, and we’ll strive to please you every day.  
NEW POEM
 i had not thought of violets late, the wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet in wistful april days, when lovers mate and wander through the fields in raptures sweet. the thought of violets meant florists' shops, and bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine; and garish lights, and mincing little fops and cabarets and soaps, and deadening wines. so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed, i had forgot wide fields; and clear brown streams; the perfect loveliness that god has made,— wild violets shy and heaven-mounting dreams. and now—unwittingly, you've made me dream of violets, and my soul's forgotten gleam.  
NEW POEM
 cover me with your everlasting arms, ye guardian giants of this solitude! from the ill-sight of men, and from the rude, tumultuous din of yon wild world’s alarms! oh, knit your mighty limbs around, above, and close me in for ever! let me dwell with the wood spirits, in the darkest cell that ever with your verdant locks ye wove. the air is full of countless voices, joined in one eternal hymn; the whispering wind, the shuddering leaves, the hidden water springs, the work-song of the bees, whose honeyed wings hang in the golden tresses of the lime, or buried lie in purple beds of thyme.  
NEW POEM
 a man talking to his ex-wife on the phone. he has loved her voice and listens with attention to every modulation of its tone. knowing it intimately. not knowing what he wants from the sound of it, from the tendered civility. he studies, out the window, the seed shapes of the broken pods of ornamental trees. the kind that grow in everyone’s garden, that no one but horticulturists can name. four arched chambers of pale green, tiny vegetal proscenium arches, a pair of black tapering seeds bedded in each chamber. a wish geometry, miniature, indian or persian, lovers or gods in their apartments. outside, white, patient animals, and tangled vines, and rain.  
NEW POEM
 that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. in me thou see'st the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west, which by and by black night doth take away, death's second self, that seals up all in rest. in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie, as the death-bed whereon it must expire, consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by. this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, to love that well which thou must leave ere long.  
NEW POEM
 how like a winter hath my absence been from thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! what freezings have i felt, what dark days seen! what old december's bareness everywhere! and yet this time remov'd was summer's time, the teeming autumn, big with rich increase, bearing the wanton burthen of the prime, like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease: yet this abundant issue seem'd to me but hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit; for summer and his pleasures wait on thee, and thou away, the very birds are mute; or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.  
NEW POEM
 the maggot dreams of the ear and the wound, that welcome dark between  gauze and knee, cheek and skull, and any open moment in the  body that will have it. the child- fly wants a mouth to grow into,  a burn to salve, a heart to feed on. it calls for sugar and job  and marrow. the maggot loves st. lazarus, though he walked away,  loves the warm cutbanks of the chest. when the maggot asks for wings, we  will answer with painted hands, eyes beneath coins, a promise of graves.  
NEW POEM
 on the fleet streams, the sun, that late arose, in amber radiance plays; the tall young grass no foot hath bruised; clear morning, as i pass, breathes the pure gale, that on the blossom blows; and, as with gold yon green hill’s summit glows, the lake inlays the vale with molten glass: now is the year’s soft youth, yet one, alas! cheers not as it was wont; impending woes weigh on my heart; the joys, that once were mine, spring leads not back; and those that yet remain fade while she blooms. each hour more lovely shine her crystal beams, and feed her floral train, but oh with pale, and warring fires, decline those eyes, whose light my filial hopes sustain.  
NEW POEM
 soon the summer now the pleasant purgatory of spring is over,  soon the choking humidity in the city  on the fire escapes in a sleeveless t-shirt smoking a cigar  in tune with the tremor of the mindless yellow commercial traffic  moving in the city, where no one really buys a car,  american or otherwise, where we will,  as rilke said we would where we will wake, read, write  long letters and in the avenues wander restlessly  to and fro on foot in the humidity,  where soon i’ll shower, dress, take the dog out for a piss, and mail this.  
NEW POEM
 the sorrow of true love is a great sorrow and true love parting blackens a bright morrow: yet almost they equal joys, since their despair is but hope blinded by its tears, and clear above the storm the heavens wait to be seen. but greater sorrow from less love has been that can mistake lack of despair for hope and knows not tempest and the perfect scope of summer, but a frozen drizzle perpetual of drops that from remorse and pity fall and cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw, removed eternally from the sun’s law.

NEW POEM
 down, unequal weight on his haunches and the rain driving his shirt sideways, his legs are as rigid as the stone and timber that props him up. ears, half-opened lips slurred to bits; a head no longer able to troubleshoot the broken glass inside him.   •   wiry treetops are blacker. the after-rain light diffused to near neon-gray. there was a boy seen by neighbors running the width of the field. one said he disappeared — as if he fell headlong into the horizon. another said it wasn’t a boy, but a hart. next to nothing left where evans was found, but there was a sound box, some thing in which his soul made itself felt.  
NEW POEM
 the birdhouse made from a gourd is wired to a flanged loop of steel and screwed to the southeast post of the shack. two holes at the top—near where the stem was, for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke— are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it’s become. the broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdly basso profundo that pearls through the steel, into the post, the floor joists and walls in two notes: a slightly sharp d and an equally sharp f, says the guitar tuner, which explains why all my thinking these days is in b-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinet and this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woe makes it a minor chord i am in the middle of. nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luff of limbs and needles suggests, and sail on, the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chattering like a gull, and the mountain’s last drift of snow resembling the back of a sounding whale. hear the thrum of the rigging, daggoo? hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-goo and doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers, by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdness of the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once, this nowhere we shall not be returning from. draw the lines! assume the crow’s nest, pip. this ship sails on music and wind, and away with birds.  
NEW POEM
 in the backyard of my father’s house a hen’s warm neck once filled the center of my pale fist.  her place on the stump still wears my shadow like a stain.  
NEW POEM
 from the old bridge we’d been stopped on, a little below us, it looked like a diving board. when the girl switched her sign from stop to slow i saw across the river three men standing like old- fashioned divers at its base, newsreels we’d seen of men in swim caps. “hard hats,” you literal you.  you agreed with “like a diving board,” but no spring to it. something below was holding it up, something concrete. it was the business of your life. concrete— but for me the men were waiting their turn over there, each to compete for the best two-and-a-half gainer to knife the tye river. they’d die, you said.  “that’s a fine span,” i learned, “a very long one— they didn’t make ’em like that back then.” or us either, i thought as i almost saw the hard hat bounce at the tip, his one knee up to his waist. “inspectors,” you said as we drove across, “lolly- gagging.” whichever. our span is ready.  
NEW POEM
 in the middle of the night, father brought me a falcon.  by morning, it ripped the wire and flew the hill into the highway.  when they found me in that car my sleeve stemmed in blood,  i didn’t know what it was i was trying to kill.  i saw a craft of orphans steaming down the river. they were dressed in white and silent as a séance.  it was then i spoke to the bird.  already god is shaking his black seed back into me.  
NEW POEM
 this was more like the atmosphere had been pinched, whose chirp was an unexpected gust in a harmonium enough to break all that high horse talk that curdles the atmosphere. while centaurs  ate grass and hurdled epitaphs, that chirp in the midst did change one of us. 'twas clawed out in a feeling’s flock 'twas 'couraged by the tall grass  
NEW POEM
 never the bark and abalone mask cracked by storms of a mastering god, never the gods’ favored glamour, never the pelagic messenger bearing orchards in its beak, never allegory, not wisdom or valor or cunning, much less hunger demanding vigilance, industry, invention, or the instinct to claim some small rise above the plain and from there to assert the song of another day ending; lentil brown, uncounted, overlooked in the clamorous public of the flock so unlikely to be noticed here by arrivals, faces shining with oils of their many miles, where it hops and scratches below the baggage carousel and lights too high, too bright for any real illumination, looking more like a fumbled punch line than a stowaway whose revelation recalls how lightly we once traveled.  
NEW POEM
 water-flesh gleamed like mica: orange fins, red flankspots, a char shy as ginseng, found only in spring-flow gaps, the thin clear of faraway creeks no map could name. my cousin showed me those hidden places. i loved how we found them, the way we followed no trail, just stream-sound tangled in rhododendron, to where slow water opened a hole to slip a line in, and lift as from a well bright shadows of another world, held in my hand, their color already starting to fade.  
NEW POEM
 in the coolness here i care not for the down-pressed noises overhead, i hear in my pearly bone the wear of marble under the rain; nothing is truly dead, there is only the wearing away, the changing of means. nor eyes i have to tell how in the summer the mourning dove rocks on the hemlock’s arm, nor ears to rend the sad regretful mind with the call of the horned lark. i lie so still that the earth around me shakes with the weight of day; i do not mind if the vase holds decomposed cut flowers, or if they send one of their kind to tidy up. such play i have no memories of, nor of the fire-bush flowers, or the bark of the rough pine where the crows with their great haw and flap circle in kinned excitement when a wind blows. i am kin with none of these, nor even wed to the yellowing silk that splits; my sensitive bones, which dreaded, as all the living do, the dead, wait for some unappointed pattern. the wits of countless centuries dry in my skull and overhead i do not heed the first rain out of winter, nor do i care what they have planted. at my center the bone glistens; of wondrous bones i am made; and alone shine in a phosphorous glow, so, in this little plot where i am laid.

 complex amaryllis — two-faced, multiflorus, wrath-spathed ball of ire — grows flagrantly unfragrant. pulp-fiery the take-no-prisoners haemanthus. bully! bully! bully the bloodflower! (blood- thirsty suffice it to suffuse.) transfuse the lily-livered, the raging un-aromatic, the arrogant blood-rivering spleen.  
NEW POEM
 none of us understands our story better than this nonentity, unconscious slip of nature, nonetheless our common parent dilating at the bottom of the sea.  the parent, too, of octopus and pony, of reefs and villages, once it was strange simply for being not a rock itself— not rock, but a blank sleep on a rock shelf.  and, deeply sympathetic to the rock, to sea and sea-dust washing through its skin, it knows, although it doesn’t know it knows, that minds and their milieux are all one thing.  some see its way of thinking; most, not yet. still, one day, just by living, all will find reason enough within themselves to think the single thought forever in its mind.  
NEW POEM
 again with spring she wore light colours and with gentle steps again with spring again in summer she was smiling.  among fresh blossoms breast naked to the veins beyond the dry night beyond the white old men debating quietly whether it would be better to give up the keys or to pull the rope and hang from the noose to leave empty bodies there where souls couldn’t endure there where the mind couldn’t catch up and knees buckled.  with the new blossoms the old men failed and gave up on everything grandchildren and great-grandchildren the broad fields the green mountains love and life compassion and shelter rivers and sea; and they departed like statues leaving behind a silence that no sword could cut that no gallop could break nor the voices of the young; and the great loneliness came the great privation along with this spring and settled and spread like the frost of dawn caught hold of the high branches slid down the trunks of trees and wrapped around our soul.  but she smiled wearing light colours like a blossoming almond tree in yellow flames and walked along lightly opening windows in the delighted sky without us the luckless ones. and i saw her breast naked the waist and the knee, as the inviolate martyr inviolate and pure issues from the torment to go to heaven, beyond the inexplicable whispering of people in the boundless circus beyond the black grimace the sweaty neck of the exasperated executioner striking vainly.  the loneliness now a lake the privation now a lake untouched and untraceable.   16 march ’39

 bath  the day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air. the sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. it cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light. little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. i move a foot, and the planes of light in the water jar. i lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. the day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. i will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. the sky is blue and high. a crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.  breakfast table  in the fresh-washed sunlight, the breakfast table is decked and white. it offers itself in flat surrender, tendering tastes, and smells, and colours, and metals, and grains, and the white cloth falls over its side, draped and wide. wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee-pot, hot and spinning like catherine-wheels, they whirl, and twirl—and my eyes begin to smart, the little white, dazzling wheels prick them like darts. placid and peaceful, the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask. a stack of butter-pats, pyramidal, shout orange through the white, scream, flutter, call: “yellow! yellow! yellow!” coffee steam rises in a stream, clouds the silver tea-service with mist, and twists up into the sunlight, revolved, involuted, suspiring higher and higher, fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky. a crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam. the day is new and fair with good smells in the air.  walk  over the street the white clouds meet, and sheer away without touching. on the sidewalks, boys are playing marbles. glass marbles, with amber and blue hearts, roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise. the boys strike them with black and red striped agates. the glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit, and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water. i smell tulips and narcissus in the air, but there are no flowers anywhere, only white dust whipping up the street, and a girl with a gay spring hat and blowing skirts. the dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat, high-heeled patent leather shoes. tap, tap, the little heels pat the pavement, and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat. a water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way. it is green and gay with new paint, and rumbles contentedly, sprinkling clear water over the white dust. clear zigzagging water, which smells of tulips and narcissus. the thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky. whoop! the clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time. whoop! and a man’s hat careers down the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green. a motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air, sharp-beaked, irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. a glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles down. the sky is quiet and high, and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air.  midday and afternoon  swirl of crowded streets. shock and recoil of traffic. the stock-still brick façade of an old church, against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw. flare of sunshine down side-streets. eddies of light in the windows of chemists’ shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far into the crowd. loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and motors. a quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky. i am a piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd. proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet. feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps. a boy is selling papers, i smell them clean and new from the press. they are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus. the blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame.  night and sleep  the day takes her ease in slippered yellow. electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. they grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades. trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night. twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over the way: plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker’s sign with its length on another street. a gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building, but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours? i leave the city with speed. wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness. the breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but recently from the high sky. there are no flowers in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus. my room is tranquil and friendly. out of the window i can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little flower-heads with no stems. i cannot see the beer-glass, nor the letters of the restaurants and shops i passed, now the signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the spring. the night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air. wrap me close, sheets of lavender. pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears. the breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways. pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair . . . i smell the stars . . . they are like tulips and narcissus . . . i smell them in the air.

 i run high in my body on the road toward sea.  i fall in love. the things the wind is telling me.  the yellow sky quiet in her quiet dress.  old birds sending news from the reddish hills.  &amp; the one hawk flying in the distance overhead.  that hawk is what the wind says. in love  with the heaving of my peacock chest,  with my lungs, two wings, such flying things,  but mine for now, just for now as i open my stride  above the good, dirt road, fall in love with the mustard  &amp; coriander dust, &amp; the far, far mountain  beveled by light, by rain, the easy eye of the sun, now,  smoke floating across the hillside like a face i knew once very well.  very well, i fall in love with the flowers &amp; the wash  hung like prayer flags, see, in red juanita's yard. in love  with the earth the color of earth. in love with the goats, their bellies &amp; hooves,  &amp; the goat mouths bleating as they greet me on the road.  i fall in love. how they wear their strange &amp; double-eyes.  how they do not blink or laugh at me  or say a thing i understand when i ask them in my english,  because they circle around my feet, as if they always knew me,  were you my children once? did i know your names?  oh, little magics? little children?

 there’s an isle, a green isle, set in the sea, here’s to the saint that blessed it! and here’s to the billows wild and free that for centuries have caressed it!  here’s to the day when the men that roam send longing eyes o’er the water! here’s to the land that still spells home to each loyal son and daughter!  here’s to old ireland—fair, i ween, with the blue skies stretched above her! here’s to her shamrock warm and green, and here’s to the hearts that love her!

 "and then there were three whereas before there had been four or two  and then there were four or two." thus spake the king. no one dared ask what it meant.  he seemed satisfied by the beauty of the logic that had arrived, the royal hall now lightly radiant  as he arose from his throne and the world fell away, courtiers, battlements, and clouds,  and he rose like a piece of paper on which his effigy had been traced in dotted lines whose dots came loose  and flew away to a place in history where nothing mattered. and then there was one.

 twinkle, twinkle, little star, how i wonder what you are ! up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.  when the blazing sun is gone, when he nothing shines upon, then you show your little light, twinkle, twinkle, all the night.  then the trav'ller in the dark, thanks you for your tiny spark, he could not see which way to go, if you did not twinkle so.  in the dark blue sky you keep, and often thro' my curtains peep, for you never shut your eye, till the sun is in the sky.  'tis your bright and tiny spark, lights the trav'ller in the dark : tho' i know not what you are, twinkle, twinkle, little star.

 snarls, bread trucks, yeast breathing inside huddled bags, and sleepers completing lives behind their gray windows.  a whistle on the phonewires, feathers, twitches, whistling down to the hot loaves.  reeds everywhere, pulse, flesh, flutes, and wakened sighs. an answer. radio news  and breathers behind our windows, birds’ new voices changing, changed, to the unforgiving hunger screech of immigrants.

 still, citizen sparrow, this vulture which you call unnatural, let him but lumber again to air over the rotten office, let him bear the carrion ballast up, and at the tall  tip of the sky lie cruising. then you’ll see that no more beautiful bird is in heaven’s height, no wider more placid wings, no watchfuller flight; he shoulders nature there, the frightfully free,  the naked-headed one. pardon him, you who dart in the orchard aisles, for it is he devours death, mocks mutability, has heart to make an end, keeps nature new.  thinking of noah, childheart, try to forget how for so many bedlam hours his saw soured the song of birds with its wheezy gnaw, and the slam of his hammer all the day beset  the people’s ears. forget that he could bear to see the towns like coral under the keel, and the fields so dismal deep. try rather to feel how high and weary it was, on the waters where  he rocked his only world, and everyone’s. forgive the hero, you who would have died gladly with all you knew; he rode that tide to ararat; all men are noah’s sons.

 ancient of days, old friend, no one believes you’ll come back. no one believes in his own life anymore.  the moon, like a dead heart, cold and unstartable, hangs by a thread at the earth’s edge, unfaithful at last, splotching the ferns and the pink shrubs.  in the other world, children undo the knots in their tally strings. they sing songs, and their fingers blear.  and here, where the swan hums in his socket, where bloodroot and belladonna insist on our comforting, where the fox in the canyon wall empties our hands, ecstatic for more,  like a bead of clear oil the healer revolves through the night wind, part eye, part tear, unwilling to recognize us.

 december 26, 1969 dear kenward, what a pearl of a letter knife. it's just the thing i needed, something to rest my eyes on, and always wanted, which is to say it's that of which i felt the lack but didn't know of, of no real use and yet essential as a button box, or maps, green morning skies, islands and canals in oatmeal, the steam off oyster stew. brown agate, veined as a woods by smoke that has to it the watery twist of eel grass in a quick, rust-discolored cove. undulating lines of northern evening—a munch without the angst—a hint of almost amber: to the nose, a resinous thought, to the eye, a lacquered needle green where no green is, a present after-image. sleek as an ax, bare and elegant as a tarn, manly as a lingam, november weather petrified, it is just the thing to do what with? to open letters? no, it is just the thing, an object, dark, fierce and beautiful in which the surprise is that the surprise, once past, is always there: which to enjoy is not to consume. the un- recapturable returns in a brown world made out of wood, snow streaked, storm epi- center still in stone.

 whose woods these are i think i know. his house is in the village though; he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow.  my little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year.  he gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. the only other sound’s the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.  the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but i have promises to keep, and miles to go before i sleep, and miles to go before i sleep.

 (after ehrich weiss) i   geography matters. it is the plan, the arrangement of things that confuses our enemies, the difference between what they expect and what they get; as simple as bobbing for apples becomes difficult, deception is an achievement in ordering the obvious.   ii   let us make a song for our confusion: call it “red skies over gary” or “red skies in the sunset” or “red skies and the open hearth.”  red skies over gary, you are my sunset, my only home.  let us make ourselves invisible, not make songs, or even disappear suddenly from the sidewalks of calumet.   iii   cobalt and carborundum are refinements of the art.  so it’s true, you held the razor in your teeth, or was it pure magic, a miracle of place? one makes for workability, the other for hardness, and chromium bright, the stainless achievement.   iv   i came from calumet to gary, and it was early evening; south of the mills, poppy fields toxic red above the car lots, have a coke on texaco ’til the mercury arcs devour us and it is purple night.

 and a tenth part of okeanos is given to dark night a tithe of the pure water    under    earth so that the clear fountains pour from rock face, tears stream from the caverns and clefts, down-running, carving woundrous ways in basalt resistance, cutting deep as they go into layers of time-layerd gaia where she sleeps—  the cold water, the black rushing gleam, the moving down-rush, wash, gush out over bed-rock, toiling the boulders in flood, purling in deeps, broad flashing in falls—  and a tenth part of bright clear okeanos his circulations— mists, rains, sheets, sheathes— lies in poisonous depths, the black water.  styx    this carver of caverns beneath us is. styx    this black water,    this down-pouring.  the well is deep.    from its stillness the words our voices speak      echo. resonance follows resonance. waves of this sounding come up to us.  we draw the black water, pure and cold. the light of day is not as bright as this crystal flowing.  three thousand years we have recited its virtue out of hesiod. is it twenty-five thousand since the ice withdrew from the lands    and we came forth from the realm of caverns where the river beneath the earth    we knew we go back to. styx pouring down in the spring from its glacial remove, from the black ice.  fifty million years—from the beginning of what we are— we knew the depth of this well to be.  fifty million years deep    —but our knowing deepens —time deepens— this still water  we thirst for      in dreams we dread.

 come we to the summer, to the summer we will come, for the woods are full of bluebells and the hedges full of bloom, and the crow is on the oak a-building of her nest, and love is burning diamonds in my true lover's breast; she sits beneath the whitethorn a-plaiting of her hair, and i will to my true lover with a fond request repair; i will look upon her face, i will in her beauty rest, and lay my aching weariness upon her lovely breast.  the clock-a-clay is creeping on the open bloom of may, the merry bee is trampling the pinky threads all day, and the chaffinch it is brooding on its grey mossy nest in the whitethorn bush where i will lean upon my lover's breast; i'll lean upon her breast and i'll whisper in her ear that i cannot get a wink o'sleep for thinking of my dear; i hunger at my meat and i daily fade away like the hedge rose that is broken in the heat of the day.

 can we learn wisdom watching insects now, or just the art of quiet observation? creatures from the world of leaf and flower marking weather’s variation.  the huge dry summer of the ladybirds (we thought we’d never feel such heat again) started with white cabbage butterflies sipping at thin trickles in the drain.  then one by one the ladybirds appeared obeying some far purpose or design. we marvelled at their numbers in the garden, grouped together, shuffling in a line.  each day a few strays turned up at the table, the children laughed to see them near the jam exploring round the edges of a spoon. one tried to drink the moisture on my arm.  how random and how frail seemed their lives, and yet how they persisted, refugees, saving energy by keeping still and hiding in the grass and in the trees.  and then one day they vanished overnight. clouds gathered, storm exploded, weather cleared. and all the wishes that we might have had in such abundance simply disappeared.

 this is the time lean woods shall spend a steeped-up twilight, and the pale evening drink, and the perilous roe, the leaper to the west brink, trembling and bright to the caverned cloud descend.  now shall you see pent oak gone gusty and frantic, stooped with dry weeping, ruinously unloosing the sparse disheveled leaf, or reared and tossing a dreary scarecrow bough in funeral antic.  then, tatter you and rend, oak heart, to your profession mourning; not obscure the outcome, not crepuscular; on the deep floor sable and gold match lustres and contend.  and rags of shrouding will not muffle the slain. this is the immortal extinction, the priceless wound not to be staunched. the live gold leaks beyond, and matter’s sanctified, dipped in a gold stain.

 the emperor thought of his heart as a water wheel flooding the rice fields of all creation and bloodied the water for a better harvest. his warriors hoped for a life with wings. his swallowtails wrote him the same lines —the secret of life is a resurrected worm— he told them eventually time would run backwards in their hands, now empty where a crossbow went.  a theory works if it answers the exceptions. the writing in the air of swallowtails, from here to where the time changes at mexico beach, is like writing all the armies of the afterlife waiting underground in china.  we are attuned to shadows. they strafe the shore. an osprey spins above the trees. but when a large one stops suddenly above the house, all the laws have been broken. a theory that a moment is a warehouse where armies are stacked to the ceiling, then one falls, is the last exception. the osprey’s underside is streaked like a zebra swallowtail. it misses the fish that dove out of the reach of shadows as the lovers jumped into theirs from the bay bridge to fort walton. if any should meet hovering over a milkweed or reflection, they might say didn’t i know you in another life, the kind of thing said often in fort walton or the orient and didn’t plum blossoms freeze in the emperor’s courtyard.

 bing crosby died in spain while playing golf with franco but who could care less, and at this writing only a few of my dear ones are gone—ah i could make a sad list—the swifts, as if to prove a point, fly into the light and make a mockery out of our darkness. they scream for food but in the world of shadows they only make a quick motion; i have studied them—the whiter the wall is—the barer the bulb— the more they scream, the more they dip down. i have made my two hands into a shape and i have darkened the wall to see what it looks like—i have shortened my two broken fingers to make the small tail and twisted the knuckles sideways so when they come in to eat one shadow overtakes the other, that way i can live in the darkness with franco's poisonous head and crosby's ears, who fainted, a thousand to one, behind a number two club, though no swift died for him, well, for them, digging for clubs. i watch the birds every night; they fly in a great circle, much larger than what i can see, their dipping is what i dreaded in front of my plain white wall—i say it for the nine hundred americans who died in spain. i thought i'd have to wait forever to do them a tiny justice and listen to their songs and die a little from the foolhardy mournful words, flying down one air current or another and doing the sides of buildings and tops of trees, the low-lying straggling dogwood, the full-bodied huge red maple, my dear ones.

 for gertrude ederle as europe woke from sleep, young trudy ederle at cap gris nez in france dived into a daunting sea.  many had tried to make this superhuman swim — thirty-five punishing miles. chances, at best, were slim.  when fury found the waves, far from the western shore, her trainer shouted, "let's turn back!" but trudy cried, "what for?"  under an english moon, the celebration began after the fastest crossing by woman or by man.

 i spy his head above the waves, big as a man’s fist, black eyes peering at me, until he dives into darker, deeper water. yesterday i saw him a foot from my outstretched hand, already tilting his great domed shell away. ribbons of green moss rippled behind him, growing along the ridge of his back and down his long reptilian tail. he swims in everything he knows, and what he knows is never forgotten. wisely, he fears me as if i were the plague, which i am, sick unto death, swimming to heal myself in his primeval sea.

 i know what the caged bird feels, alas! when the sun is bright on the upland slopes; when the wind stirs soft through the springing grass, and the river flows like a stream of glass; when the first bird sings and the first bud opes, and the faint perfume from its chalice steals— i know what the caged bird feels!  i know why the caged bird beats his wing till its blood is red on the cruel bars; for he must fly back to his perch and cling when he fain would be on the bough a-swing; and a pain still throbs in the old, old scars and they pulse again with a keener sting— i know why he beats his wing!  i know why the caged bird sings, ah me, when his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,— when he beats his bars and he would be free; it is not a carol of joy or glee, but a prayer that he sends from his heart’s deep core, but a plea, that upward to heaven he flings— i know why the caged bird sings!

 no but come closer. come a little closer. let the wall-eyed hornyhanded panhandler hit you for a dime sir and shiver. snow like this drives its pelting shadows over bremen, over sad louvain and the eastern marshes, the black wold. it sighs into the cold sea of the north, that vast contemptuous revery between antiquity and you. turn up your collar, pull your hatbrim down. commune briefly with your ignorant heart for those bewildered raging children europe surrenders her old gentry to.  all their eyes turn in the night from your fretfulness and forgetfulness, your talk; they turn away, friend. their eyes dilated with dreams of power fix on the image of the mob wet with blood scaling the gates of order. anarchist and incendiary caesar bind that brotherhood to use and crush the civil guard, debauch the debauché, level tenement and court with soaring sideslipping squadrons and hard regiments, stripped for the smoking levée of the howitzer, thunderstruck under the net.  the great mouth of hunger closes on swineherd and princess, on the air of jongleur and forest bell; grendel swims from the foul deep again. deputy, cartelist, academician question in haste any plumeless captain before the peremptory descent of mankind, flattered and proud. with whitening morning on the waste you may discern through binoculars a long line of the shawled and frozen, moving yet motionless, as if those were populations whom the sun failed and the malicious moon enchanted to wander and be still forever the prey of wolves and bestial mazes.

 up! up! my friend, and quit your books; or surely you'll grow double: up! up! my friend, and clear your looks; why all this toil and trouble?  the sun above the mountain's head, a freshening lustre mellow through all the long green fields has spread, his first sweet evening yellow.  books! 'tis a dull and endless strife: come, hear the woodland linnet, how sweet his music! on my life, there's more of wisdom in it.  and hark! how blithe the throstle sings! he, too, is no mean preacher: come forth into the light of things, let nature be your teacher.  she has a world of ready wealth, our minds and hearts to bless— spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, truth breathed by cheerfulness.  one impulse from a vernal wood may teach you more of man, of moral evil and of good, than all the sages can.  sweet is the lore which nature brings; our meddling intellect mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:— we murder to dissect.  enough of science and of art; close up those barren leaves; come forth, and bring with you a heart that watches and receives.

 (excerpt) hark! ’tis the twanging horn! o’er yonder bridge, that with its wearisome but needful length bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright; he comes, the herald of a noisy world, with spatter’d boots, strapp’d waist, and frozen locks, news from all nations lumb’ring at his back. true to his charge, the close-pack’d load behind, yet careless what he brings, his one concern is to conduct it to the destin’d inn: and having dropp’d th’ expected bag—pass on. he whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch, cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some, to him indiff’rent whether grief or joy. houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks, births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet with tears, that trickled down the writer’s cheeks, fast as the periods from his fluent quill, or charg’d with am’rous sighs of absent swains, or nymphs responsive, equally affect his horse and him, unconscious of them all. but oh th’ important budget! usher’d in with such heart-shaking music, who can say what are its tidings? have our troops awak’d? or do they still, as if with opium drugg’d, snore to the murmurs of th’ atlantic wave? is india free? and does she wear her plum’d and jewell’d turban with a smile of peace, or do we grind her still? the grand debate, the popular harangue, the tart reply, the logic, and the wisdom, and the wit, and the loud laugh—i long to know them all; i burn to set th’ imprison’d wranglers free, and give them voice and utt’rance once again.  now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast, let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round, and, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn throws up a steamy column, and the cups, that cheer but not inebriate, wait on each, so let us welcome peaceful ev’ning in. not such his ev’ning, who with shining face sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeez’d and bor’d with elbow-points through both his sides, out-scolds the ranting actor on the stage: nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb, and his head thumps, to feed upon the breath of patriots, bursting with heroic rage, or placemen, all tranquility and smiles. this folio of four pages, happy work! which not ev’n critics criticise; that holds inquisitive attention, while i read, fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair, though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break; what is it but a map of busy life, its fluctuations, and its vast concerns?  . . .  oh winter! ruler of th’ inverted year, thy scatter’d hair with sleet like ashes fill’d, thy breath congeal’d upon thy lips, thy cheeks fring’d with a beard made white with other snows than those of age; thy forehead wrapt in clouds, a leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne a sliding car, indebted to no wheels, but urg’d by storms along its slipp’ry way; i love thee, all unlovely as thou seem’st, and dreaded as thou art!  thou hold’st the sun a pris’ner in the yet undawning east, short’ning his journey between morn and noon, and hurrying him, impatient of his stay, down to the rosy west; but kindly still compensating his loss with added hours of social converse and instructive ease, and gathering at short notice, in one group, the family dispers’d, and fixing thought, not less dispers’d by day-light and its cares. i crown thee king of intimate delights, fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness, and all the comforts that the lowly roof of undisturb’d retirement, and the hours of long uninterrupted evening, know. no ratt’ling wheels stop short before these gates; no powder’d pert proficient in the art of sounding an alarm, assaults these doors till the street rings; no stationary steeds cough their own knell, while, heedless of the sound, the silent circle fan themselves, and quake: but here the needle plies its busy task, the pattern grows, the well-depicted flow’r, wrought patiently into the snowy lawn, unfolds its bosom; buds, and leaves, and sprigs, and curling tendrils, gracefully dispos’d, follow the nimble finger of the fair; a wreath that cannot fade, or flow’rs that blow with most success when all besides decay. the poet’s or historian’s page, by one made vocal for th’ amusement of the rest; the sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds the touch from many a trembling chord shakes out; and the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct, and in the charming strife triumphant still, beguile the night, and set a keener edge on female industry; the threaded steel flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds. the volume clos’d, the customary rites of the last meal commence.  a roman meal; such as the mistress of the world once found delicious, when her patriots of high note, perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors, and under an old oak’s domestic shade, enjoy’d, spare feast! a radish and an egg. discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull, nor such as with a frown forbids the play of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth: nor do we madly, like an impious world, who deem religion frenzy, and the god that made them an intruder on their joys, start at his awful name, or deem his praise a jarring note.  themes of a graver tone, exciting oft our gratitude and love, while we retrace with mem’ry’s pointing wand, that calls the past to our exact review, the dangers we have ’scap’d, the broken snare, the disappointed foe, deliv’rance found unlook’d for, life preserv’d and peace restor’d, fruits of omnipotent eternal love. oh ev’nings worthy of the gods! exclaim’d the sabine bard.  oh ev’nings, i reply, more to be priz’d and coveted than yours, as more illumin’d, and with nobler truths, that i and mine, and those we love, enjoy.

 beautiful railway bridge of the silv’ry tay! alas! i am very sorry to say that ninety lives have been taken away on the last sabbath day of 1879, which will be remember’d for a very long time.  ’twas about seven o’clock at night, and the wind it blew with all its might, and the rain came pouring down, and the dark clouds seem’d to frown, and the demon of the air seem’d to say— “i’ll blow down the bridge of tay.”  when the train left edinburgh the passengers’ hearts were light and felt no sorrow, but boreas blew a terrific gale, which made their hearts for to quail, and many of the passengers with fear did say— “i hope god will send us safe across the bridge of tay.”  but when the train came near to wormit bay, boreas he did loud and angry bray, and shook the central girders of the bridge of tay on the last sabbath day of 1879, which will be remember’d for a very long time.  so the train sped on with all its might, and bonnie dundee soon hove in sight, and the passengers’ hearts felt light, thinking they would enjoy themselves on the new year, with their friends at home they lov’d most dear, and wish them all a happy new year.  so the train mov’d slowly along the bridge of tay, until it was about midway, then the central girders with a crash gave way, and down went the train and passengers into the tay! the storm fiend did loudly bray, because ninety lives had been taken away, on the last sabbath day of 1879, which will be remember’d for a very long time.  as soon as the catastrophe came to be known the alarm from mouth to mouth was blown, and the cry rang out all o’er the town, good heavens! the tay bridge is blown down, and a passenger train from edinburgh, which fill’d all the people’ hearts with sorrow, and made them for to turn pale, because none of the passengers were sav’d to tell the tale how the disaster happen’d on the last sabbath day of 1879, which will be remember’d for a very long time.  it must have been an awful sight, to witness in the dusky moonlight, while the storm fiend did laugh, and angry did bray, along the railway bridge of the silv’ry tay, oh! ill-fated bridge of the silv’ry tay, i must now conclude my lay by telling the world fearlessly without the least dismay, that your central girders would not have given way, at least many sensible men do say, had they been supported on each side with buttresses, at least many sensible men confesses, for the stronger we our houses do build, the less chance we have of being killed.

 the phoenicians guarded a recipe that required ten thousand murex shells to make an ounce of tyrian purple.  scan the surface of aldebaran with a radio wave; grind lapis lazuli into ultramarine.  search the summer sky for an anasazi turkey constellation; see algae under an electron microscope resemble a magellanic cloud.  a chemist tried to convert benzene into quinine, but blundered into a violet aniline dye instead.  have you ever seen maggots feed on a dead rat? listen to a red-tailed hawk glide over the hushed spruce and  pines in a canyon. feel a drop of water roll down a pine needle, and glisten, hanging, at the tip.

 to map the consequences of regardless, of underestimate, of feverish faith, of the mechanical modernism of your false terrain. as if port sulphur remained nominal, its slick globules merely figurative between territories of wait and wetlands of trust.  to etch the shallow-water horizon— a techno-utopian tribute to shrimp estuaries, bird rookeries, oyster bays, to tube worms &amp; sea turtles. to watercolor these pelican grasses, oxidized, unapologetic executive marshes, roseated spoonbills.  for you who longed to smear concentric circles, to have trusted you with longitude and latitude, to blur this sargassum border between mourning, fighting, and willful denying of objects and subjects. as if  generations of fishermen, scaling orders of magnitude, navigated oily streaks of miles in a legend of inches, skeletal, ghostly swarms of now-opaque, milky jellyfish. as if to bury the blowout, rescind the rig. to fortify, to intone.  if naming were not violence,to witness an active verb: top kill, junk shot, top hat, dance dance revolution. these wayward scripts a frontier province palimpsest. offshore yet another beacon, another account. explosive violet iridescent.

 i have known these estuaries — the channels and canals, the backwaters that flush and eddy to the pacific,  i have skimmed that muddied slurry, felt the nip in the throat where the salt in the air is the salt of the coast,  i have tacked where the tide is incomplete: no rollers and breakers, only an ebb that rocks the wayfarers —  a rush of silver, the gavel-smack of mullet in the night, mud crabs elbowing denwards under concrete slabs of boat ramps —  i have stalked where herons stilt and spear baitfish in green afternoons, cast crab pots in loose analemmas  to watch the black sonar spread, tracked prawn trawlers on the broadwater crawling back in the lavender dawn  then sat at the jetty’s edge and shucked those tiger shells, cast sucked heads back into the dark,  crushed mussel shell underfoot for the burn of sharpened chitin, stepped where stingrays wallow and idle,  shuffling their barbs, waiting to strike. i have spent half my life in low tide — nights where i have not known  if i am contracting or dragging out again, where the movement of the water is the movement of my mind —  unending comings and goings of sounds and narrows, those entry points to my two continents — and my history  is the history of currents: a canal small enough to catch a childhood in its net, water vast enough to divide a life.

 by the last few times we saw her it was clear that things were different. when you tried to help her get out of the car or get from the car to the door or across the apartment house hall to the elevator there was a new sense of heaviness or of inertia in the body. it wasn’t that she was less willing to be helped to walk but that the walking itself had become less willing. maybe the stupid demogorgon blind recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now, or maybe a new and subtle, alien, intelligence of body was obedient now to other laws: “weight is the measure of the force with which a body is drawn downward to the center of the earth”; “inertia is the tendency of a body to resist proceeding to its fate in any way other than that determined for itself.”  that evening, at the bromells’ apartment, after she had been carried up through the rational structure by articulate stages, floor after flashing floor, and after we helped her get across the hall, and get across the room to a chair, somehow we got her seated in a chair that was placed a little too far away from the nearest table, at the edge of the abyss, and there she sat, exposed, her body the object of our attention— the heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, the thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.  at work between herself and us there was a new principle of social awkwardness and skillfulness required of each of us. our tones of voice in this easy conversation were instruments of marvelous finesse, measuring and maintaining with exactitude “the fact or condition of the difference there was between us, both in space and time.”  her smiling made her look as if she had just then tasted something delicious, the charm her courtesy attributed to her friends.  this decent elegant fellow human being was seated in virtue, character, disability, behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves, the windows monitored by venetian blinds— “these can be raised or lowered; numerous slats, horizontally arranged, and parallel, which can be tilted so as to admit precisely the desired light or air.”  we were all her friends, maggie, and bill, and anne, and i, and the nice boston brahmin elderly man named duncan, utterly friendly and benign. and of course it wasn’t whether or not the world was benign but whether it looked at her too much. she wasn’t “painfully shy” but just the same i wouldn’t be surprised if there had been painfulness in her shyness earlier on, say at dancing school. like others, though, she had survived her childhood somehow. nor do i mean she was unhappy. maybe more or less so before her marriage. one had the sense of trips arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage living it through, giving it order and style. and one had the sense of the late marriage as of two bafflements inventing the sense they made together. the marriage seemed, to the outside world, and probably was, radiant and triumphant, and i think that one could almost certainly say that during the last, heroic, phase of things, after his death, and after the stroke, she had by force of character and careful management, maintained a certain degree of happiness.  the books there on the bookshelves told their stories, line after line, all of them evenly spaced, and spaces between the words. you could fall through the spaces. in one of the books dr. johnson told the story: “in the scale of being, wherever it begins, or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep; infinite vacuities ... for surely, nothing can so disturb the passions, or perplex the intellects of man so much, as the disruption of this union with visible nature, separation from all that has delighted or engaged him, a change not only of the place but of the manner of his being, an entrance into a state not simply which he knows not, but perhaps a state he has not faculties to know.”  the dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds, and yellows, produce of the season due, and fish from the nearby sea; and there were also ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.

 they call the mountain carlos because it is brown, though its purple slopes at dusk suggest other names. those who name it have to brand the earth with something they know—  a name, a face, even the heat that says "i know carlos and he is the mountain. i am going to cover his eyes in light." they call its peak carlos because it is the sharpest feature on the face that stares south, watching people cross the border, pausing to catch their breath and meet the cliffs of carlos because he is there.  when they ascend the canyons inside the face, carlos shifts and the climbers discover what he has done. the moving earth changes everything and they are forced to stop playing the game of naming a mountain that keeps touching the sun.

 what happened is, we grew lonely living among the things, so we gave the clock a face, the chair a back, the table four stout legs which will never suffer fatigue.  we fitted our shoes with tongues as smooth as our own and hung tongues inside bells so we could listen to their emotional language,  and because we loved graceful profiles the pitcher received a lip, the bottle a long, slender neck.  even what was beyond us was recast in our image; we gave the country a heart, the storm an eye, the cave a mouth so we could pass into safety.

 the first hot april day the granite step was warm. flies droned in the grass. when a car went past they rose in unison, then dropped back down. . . .  i saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced a dead oak leaf, then opened wide. how strong its appetite for the luxury of the sun!  everyone longs for love’s tense joy and red delights.  and then i spied an ant dragging a ragged, disembodied wing up the warm brick walk. it must have been the methodist in me that leaned forward, preceded by my shadow, to put a twig just where the ant was struggling with its own desire.

(this was my first prison.)  •  for the two murders i had committed, — their just, free but necessary cause  revenge, however imperfect the justice —  two successive popes recognized the necessity and pardoned me.absolved me.  because my fame as a maker in gold and silver  preceded me, though i was hardly more than an apprentice, when pope clement came into  possession of the second largest diamond in the world  he summoned me from florence to rome — called me into his presence to serve him. to crown the resplendent  glittering vestment covering his surplice, he wanted  a golden clasp big and round as a small plate, with god the father in half-relief above the diamond  and cherubs, arms raised, below.hurry, he said,  finish it quickly,so that i may enjoy its use a little while.  pope clement, unlike the great i now serve, was  an excellent, subtle connoisseur; he approved my design.  each week he summoned me into the presence  two or three times, eager to inspect my progress. then cecchino, my brother, two years younger than i  and still beardless, died —  was killed, as he tried to avenge the unjust killing of a comrade by the ruthless guard of the bargello.  thus was stolen from him the chance to incise  his presence into the hard, careless surface of the world. the fool who killed him  in what justice must call self-defense  later proved his nature by boasting of it.  his boasting enraged, maddened me. in this  great grief the pope rebuked me:you act as if grief can change death.  sleepless, eatless, by day i worked at the pope’s  absorbing golden button — and by night, hypnotized as a jealous lover, i watched and followed  the fatuous creature who murdered my brother.  at last, overcoming my repugnance to an enterprise not-quite-praiseworthy, i decided  to end my torment. my dagger entered the juncture  of the nape-bone and the neck so deep into the bone  with all my strength i could not pull it out.  i ran to the palace of duke alessandro — for those who pursued me knew me. the pope’s natural son,  later he became duke of florence, before his murder  by his own cousin lorenzino, whose too-familiar intimacies and pretensions to power  he not only indulged but openly mocked.  alessandro told me to stay indoors for eight days. for eight days i stayed indoors, working  at the jewel the pope had set his heart on.  for eight days the pope failed to summon me. then his chamberlain, saying that all was  well if i minded my work and kept silent, ushered me  into the presence. the pope cast so menacing a glance toward me i trembled.  examining my work, his countenance cleared,  saying that i had accomplished a vast amount in a short time. then he said,now that you are  cured,benvenuto — change your life.  i promised that i would.  soon after this, i opened a fine shop, my first; and finished the jewel.  •  as the knife descended (forgive me, o god of nature, but thus you have arranged it, —)  to my fevered mind each moment was infinite, and mine.  •  late one night, in farewell, michelangelo turning to me said,benvenuto,  you deliver yourself into their hands.  •  here i leapt   here i leapt   here i leapt   here i leapt the shrilling cricket in the shrilling summer evening  sings;

fed him at his own table.  imagine, tonight, the brief concert is over —  the consort of pipers (respectable, honorable amateurs: small merchants, a banker, a scholar)  mingle, slightly awed, with an ambassador, a cardinal . . .  suddenly lorenzo is at my father’s ear:he stood not six inches from me.  not six inches from my father’s ear lorenzo  in a low voice as he begins to move through the crowd followed by his son piero  (as now my father must struggle to follow)  tells my father he has painfully and increasingly remarked that the flute has led my father to neglect  his fine engineering talent and therefore my  father will understand why piero and the duke must dismiss him from the consort of pipers.  lorenzo, entering the private apartments, was gone.  in later years, my father repeated to his children:he stood not six inches from me.  it is a lie. it is a lie that the medici and you and i  stand on the same earth. what the sane eye saw, was a lie: —  two things alone cross the illimitable distance  between the great and the rest of us, who serve them: —  a knife; and art.  •  the emblem of florence is the lion; therefore lions, caged but restless and living, centuries ago  began to announce to the piazza della signoria  this is the fearsome seat of the free government of the republic of florence.  duke cosimo, hating the noise and smell, had them  moved behind the palace. for years, i had known the old man who fed and tended the lions, —  one day he humbly asked me if i could make a ring  unlike all others for his daughter’s wedding. i said yes, of course; but, as payment for its  rarity, i wanted him to drug the strongest lion  asleep, so that i could examine, for my art, his body.  he said he knew no art of drugging; such poison  could kill the creature; a week later, in fury he said yes.  the animal was numbed but not  sleeping; he tried to raise his great head, as i lay lengthwise against his warm body;  the head fell back. my head  nestling behind his, each arm, outstretched, slowly descending along each leg, at last with both hands i  pulled back the fur and touched a claw.  this creature whose claw waking could kill me, — . . . i wore its skin.  •  after the medici were returned from eighteen years’ banishment, placed over us again not by the will  of florentines, but by a spanish army —  my father, though during the republic he regained his position as piper, ever loyal to the medici  wrote a poem celebrating his party’s victory  and prophesying the imminent advent of a medici pope. then julius ii died;  cardinal de’ medici, against expectation, was elected;  the new pope wrote my father that he must come to rome and serve him.  my father had no will to travel. then jacopo  salviati, in power because married to a medici, took from my father his place at the duke’s new court;  took from him his profit, his hope, his will.  thus began that slow extinguishment of hope, the self ’s obsequies for the self  at which effacement i felt not only a helpless  witness, but cause, author.  he said i was his heart.  i had asked to be his heart before i knew what i was asking.  against his mania to make me a musician  at fifteen i put myself to the goldsmith’s trade; without money  or position, he now could not oppose this.  help the boy — for his father is poor rang in my ears as i began to sell  the first trinkets i had made. later, to escape  the plague then raging, he made me quickly leave florence; when i returned,  he, my sister, her husband and child, were dead.  these events, many occurring before my birth, i see because my father described them  often and with outrage.  to be a child is to see things and not know them; then you know them.  •  despite the malicious stars, decisive at my birth: despite their  sufficient instrument,the hand within me that moves  against me: in the utter darkness of my first prison god granted me vision:  surrounded by my stinks, an angel, his beauty  austere, not wanton, graciously showed me a room in half-light crowded with the dead:  postures blunted as if all promise of change  was lost, the dead walked up and down and back and forth:  as if the promise of change  fleeing had stolen the light. then, on the wall, there was a square of light.  careless of blindness i turned my eyes  to the full sun. i did not care to look on anything again but this. the sun  withering and quickening without distinction  then bulged out: the boss expanded: the calm body of the dead christ  formed itself from the same  substance as the sun. still on the cross, he was the same substance as the sun.  •  the bait the duke laid was perseus. perseus  standing before the piazza della signoria.  my statue’s audience and theater, michelangelo’s david; donatello’s  judith with the head of holofernes. . .  here the school of florence, swaggering, says to the world:eat.  only bandinelli’s odious hercules and cacus  reminds one that when one walks streets on earth one steps in shit.  duke cosimo desired, he said, a statue of perseus  triumphant, after intricate trials able at last to raise high  medusa’s mutilated head — he imagined,  perhaps, decapitation of the fickle rabble of republican florence . . .  i conceived the hero’s gesture as more generous: —  kill the thing that looked upon makes us stone.  soon enough, on my great bronze bust of the great  duke, i placed — staring out from his chest — medusa, her head not yet cut, living.  •  remember,benvenuto,you cannot bring your great gifts to light by your strength alone  you show your greatness only through  the opportunities we give you hold your tongue     i will drown you in gold  •  as we stared down at the vast square, at david, at j udith— then at hercules and cacus  approved and placed there by cosimo himself —  from high on the fortress lookout of the palace, against whose severe façade so many  human promises had been so cunningly  or indifferently crushed, i told the duke that i cannot make his statue. my brief return from france  was designed only to provide for the future of  my sister and six nieces, now without husband or father. the king of france alone had saved me  from the pope’s dungeon — not any lord of italy!  at this, the duke looked at me sharply, but said nothing.  all rome knew that though i had disproved  the theft that was pretext for my arrest, pope paul still kept me imprisoned, out of spite —  vengeance of his malignant son pier luigi, now  assassinated by his own retainers. one night at dinner, the king’s emissary gave the pope  gossip so delicious that out of merriment, and about to vomit  from indulgence, he agreed to free me. i owed king francis  my art, my service. the same stipend he once paid  leonardo, he now paid me; along with a house in paris. this house was, in truth, a castle . . .  i omitted, of course, quarrels with the king’s  mistress, demon who taunted me for the slowness of my work, out of her petty hatred of art itself;  omitted her insistence to the king that i  am insolent and by example teach insolence to others. omitted that i overheard the king  joke with her lieutenant: —  kill him, if you can find me his equal in art.  before the school of florence i had only been able,  young, to show myself as goldsmith and jeweler; not yet as sculptor.  duke cosimo then announced that all the king of france  had given me, he would surpass: boasting, he beckoned me to follow him past the public  common galleries, into the private apartments . . .  dutiful abashed puppet, i followed; i knew i would remain and make his statue.  •  in the mirror of art,you who are familiar with the rituals of decorum and bloodshed before which you are  silence and submission  while within stone the mind writhes  contemplate,as if a refrain were wisdom,the glistening  intrication of bronze and will and circumstance in the mirror of art.  •  bandinelli for months insinuated in the duke’s ear perseus never would be finished: —  i lacked the art, he said, to move from the small  wax model the duke rightly praised, to lifesize bronze whose secrets tormented even donatello.  so eighteen months after work began, duke cosimo grew  tired, and withdrew his subsidy. lattanzo gorini, spider-handed and gnat-voiced, refusing to hand over  payment said,why do you not finish?  then bandinelli hissed sodomite! at me — after my enumeration, to the court’s  amusement, of the sins against art and sense  committed by his hercules and cacus, recital designed to kill either him or his authority . . .  the duke, at the ugly word, frowned  and turned away. i replied that the sculptor of hercules and cacus must be a madman to think that i  presumed to understand the art that jove in heaven  used on ganymede, art nobly practiced here on earth by so many emperors and kings. my saucy speech  ended:my poor wick does not dare to burn so high!  duke and court broke into laughter. thus was born my resolve to murder bandinelli.  •  i’d hurl the creature to hell. in despair at what must follow — the duke’s rage, abandonment of my  never-to-be-born perseus — i cast  myself away for lost: with a hundred crowns and a swift horse, i resolved first to bid  farewell to my natural son, put to wet-nurse in fiesole;  then to descend to san domenico, where bandinelli returned each evening.then,after blood,france.  reaching fiesole, i saw the boy  was in good health; his wet-nurse was my old familiar, old gossip, now  married to one of my workmen. the boy  clung to me: wonderful in a two-year-old, in grief he flailed his arms when at last  in the thick half-dusk  i began to disengage myself. entering the square of san domenico on one side, i saw my prey  arriving on the other. enraged that he still  drew breath, when i reached him i saw he was unarmed. he rode a small sorry  mule. a wheezing donkey carried a ten-year-old  boy at his side. in my sudden presence, his face went white. i nodded my head and rode past.  •  i had a vision of bandinelli surrounded by the heaped-up works of his hand.  not one thing that he had made  did i want to have made. from somewhere within his body  like a thread  he spun the piles surrounding him. then he tried to pull away, to release the thread; i saw  the thread was a leash.  he tried and tried to cut it. at this, in my vision i said out-loud: —  my art is my revenge.  •  when i returned to florence from fiesole, after three days news was brought to me that my little boy  was smothered by his wet-nurse  turning over on him as they both slept. his panic, as i left; his arms raised, in panic.  •  from the great unchosen narration you will soon be released  benvenuto cellini  dirtied by blood and earth but now  you have again taught yourself to disappear  moving wax from arm to thigh  you have again taught yourself to disappear  here where each soul is its orbit spinning  sweetly around the center of itself  at the edge of its eye the great design of virtue  here your medusa and your perseus are twins  his triumphant body still furious with purpose but his face abstracted absorbed in  contemplation as she is  abstracted absorbed though blood still spurts from her neck  defeated by a mirror  as in concentration you move wax from thigh to arm  under your hand it grows  •  the idyll began when the duke reached me a goldsmith’s hammer, with which i struck the goldsmith’s  chisel he held; and so the little statues were  disengaged from earth and rust. bronze antiquities, newly found near arezzo, they lacked  either head or hands or feet. impatient for my  presence, the duke insisted that i join him each evening at his new pastime, playing artisan — leaving orders  for my free admittance to his rooms, day or night.  his four boys, when the duke’s eyes were turned, hovered around me, teasing. one night  i begged them to hold their peace.  the boldest replied,that we can’t do! i said what one cannot do is required of no one.  so have your will! faced with their sons’  delight in this new principle, the duke and duchess smiling accused me of a taste for chaos . . .  at last the four figures wrought for the four  facets of the pedestal beneath perseus were finished. i brought them one evening to the duke,  arranging them on his worktable in a row: —  figures,postures from scenes that the eye cannot entirely decipher,story haunting the eye with its  resonance, unseen ground that explains nothing. . .  the duke appeared, then immediately retreated; reappearing, in his right hand  he held a pear slip.this is for your garden,the garden of  your house. i began,do you mean, but he cut me off saying,yes,benvenuto:garden and house now are yours.  thus i received what earlier was only lent me.  i thanked him and his duchess; then both took seats before my figures.  for two hours talk was of their beauty, —  the duchess insisted they were too exquisite to be wasted down there  in the piazza; i must place them in her apartments.  no argument from intention or design unconvinced her.  so i waited till the next day — entering the private  chambers at the hour the duke and duchess each afternoon went riding, i carried the statues  down and soldered them with lead into their niches.  returning, how angry the duchess became! the duke abandoned his workshop. i went there no more.  •  the old inertia of earth that hates the new (as from a rim i watched)  rose from the ground, legion: —  truceless ministers of the great unerasable zero, eager to annihilate lineament and light,  waited, pent, against the horizon: —  some great force (massive,stubborn,multiform as earth,fury whose single name is legion, — )  wanted my perseus not to exist: —  and i must defeat them.  then my trembling assistants woke me.  they said all my work was spoiled.  perseus was spoiled. he lay buried in earth  wreathed in fragile earthenware veins from the furnace above, veins through which he still  waited to be filled with burning metal.  the metal was curdled. as i slept, sick, the bronze had been allowed to cake, to curdle.  feverish, made sick by my exertions for  days, for months, i slept; while those charged with evenly feeding the furnace that i had so well  prepared, larked —  i thought,unwitting ministers of the gorgon medusa herself. the furnace choked with caking, curdling  metal that no art known to man could  uncurdle, must be utterly dismantled — all who made it agreed this must destroy  the fragile, thirsty mould of perseus beneath.  but perseus was not more strong than medusa, but more clever: — if he ever  was to exist as idea, he must first exist as matter: —  all my old inborn daring returned,  furious to reverse  the unjust triumphs of the world’s mere arrangements of power, that seemingly on earth  cannot be reversed. first, i surveyed my forces: —  seven guilty workmen, timid, sullen, resentful; a groom; two maids; a cook.  i harassed these skeptical troops into battle: —  two hands were sent to fetch from the butcher capretta a load of young oak, —  in bronze furnaces the only woods you use  are slow-burning alder, willow, pine: now i needed oak and its fierce heat. as the oak  was fed log by log into the fire, how the cake began  to stir, to glow and sparkle. now from the increased  combustion of the furnace, a conflagration  shot up from the roof: two windows burst into flame: i saw the violent storm  filling the sky fan the flames.  all the while with pokers and iron rods we stirred and stirred the channels—  the metal, bubbling, refused to flow.  i sent for all my pewter plates, dishes, porringers — the cook and maids brought some two hundred.  piece by piece, i had them thrown  into the turgid mass. as i watched the metal for movement, the cap of the furnace  exploded — bronze welling over on all sides.  i had the plugs pulled, the mouths of the mould opened; in perfect liquefaction  the veins of perseus filled . . .  days later, when the bronze had cooled, when the clay sheath had been with great care removed, i found  what was dead brought to life again.  •  now, my second prison. it began soon after perseus was unveiled  to acclaim — great acclaim. perhaps i grew  too glorious. perseus, whose birth consumed nine years, found stuck to his pedestal  sonnets celebrating the master’s hand that made him . . .  on the day of unveiling, duke cosimo stationed himself at a window just above the entrance to the palace;  there, half-hidden, he listened for hours to the crowd’s  wonder. he sent his attendant sforza to say my reward  soon would astonish me.  ten days passed. at last sforza appeared and asked what price i placed on my statue.  i was indeed astonished:it is not my custom,  i replied,to set a price for my work,as if he were a merchant and i a mere tradesman.  then, at risk of the duke’s severe displeasure, i was  warned i must set a price: infuriated, i said ten thousand golden crowns.  cities and great palaces are built with ten thousand  golden crowns, the duke two days later flung at me in anger.  many men can build cities and palaces,  i replied,but not one can make a second perseus.  bandinelli, consulted by the duke, reluctantly  concluded that the statue was worth sixteen thousand.  the duke replied that for two farthings  perseus could go to the scrap heap; that would resolve our differences.  at last, the settlement was thirty-five hundred, one  hundred a month. soon after, charges were brought against me, for sodomy —  i escaped florence as far as scarperia, but there  the duke’s soldiers caught me and in chains brought me back.  i confessed. if i had not, i could have been made  to serve as a slave in the duke’s galleys for life. the duke listened behind a screen as i was made  publicly to confess, in full court . . . punishment  was four years imprisonment. without the duke’s concurrence, of course, no charges could have been  lodged, no public humiliation arranged  to silence the insolent.the first cosimo,founder of medici power,all his life protected donatello—whose  affections and bliss were found in ganymede.  after imprisonment one month, cosimo finally commuted my sentence to house arrest.  there his magnanimity allowed me to complete  my christ of the whitest marble set upon a cross of the blackest.  now, my christ sits still packed in a crate  in the duke’s new chapel; my bust of the duke is exiled to elba, there to frighten in open air  slaves peering out from his passing galleys.  now, after the duchess and two of their sons died of fever within two months, cosimo  grows stranger: he murdered sforza  by running him through with a spear: — he does not own  his mind; or will.  when i ask release from his service, he says that he cannot, that he soon  will have need of me for great projects; no  commissions come. catherine de’ medici, regent of the young french king, petitioned that i be allowed  to enter her service. he said i had no will now to work.  in prison i wrote my sonnet addressed to fortune: —fortune,you sow!  you turned from me because ganymede  also is my joy. . . o god of nature, author of my nature,  where does your son jesus forbid it?  when i was five, one night my father woke me. he pulled me to the basement, making me  stare into the oak fire and see what he just had seen.  there a little lizard was sporting at the core of the intensest flames.  my father boxed me on the ears, then kissed me —  saying that i must remember this night: — my dear little boy,the lizard you see  is a salamander,a creature that lives  at the heart of fire.you and i are blessed:no other soul now living has been allowed to see it.  •  i am too old to fight to leave florence: —  here, young, this goldsmith and jeweler began to imagine that  severity, that chastity of style  certain remnants of the ancient world left my hand hungry to emulate: —  equilibrium of ferocious, contradictory  forces: equilibrium whose balance or poise is their tension, and does not efface them, —  as if the surface of each thing  arranged within the frame, the surface of each body the eye must circle  gives up to the eye its vibration, its nature.  two or three times, perhaps,—you say where, — i have achieved it.  •  see, in my great bronze bust of the great duke, embedded in the right epaulette like a trophy an open-mouthed face part lion part man part goat, with an iron bar jammed in its lower jaw  rising resistlessly across its mouth.  see, in vasari’s clumsy portrait of me, as i float above the right shoulder of the duke, the same face.”  •  as if your hand fumbling to reach inside reached inside  as if light falling on the surface fell on what made the surface  as if there were no scarcity of sun on the sun    iii  i covered my arm with orchid juice.  with my hatchet i split a mangrove stick from a tree, and sharpened it.  i covered the killing stick with orchid juice.  we were camping at marunga island looking for oysters. this woman i was about to kill  at last separated herself from the others  to hunt lilies. she walked into the swamp, then got cold, and lay down on sandy ground.  after i hit her between the eyes with my hatchet  she kicked, but couldn’t raise up.  with my thumb over the end of the killing stick  i jabbed her mount of venus until her skin pushed back up to her navel. her large intestine  protruded as though it were red calico.  with my thumb over the end of the killing stick each time she inhaled  i pushed my arm  in a little. when she exhaled, i stopped. little by little i got my hand  inside her. finally i touched her heart.  once you reach what is inside it is outside. i pushed the killing stick  into her heart.  the spirit that belonged to that dead woman went into my heart then.  i felt it go in.  i pulled my arm out. i covered my arm with orchid juice.  next i broke a nest of green ants  off a tree, and watched the live ants bite her skin until her skin moved by itself  downward from her navel and covered her bones.  then i took some dry mud and put my sweat and her blood in the dry mud  and warmed it over a fire. six or eight times  i put the blood and sweat and mud inside her uterus until there was no trace of her  wound or what i had done.  i was careful none of her pubic hair was left inside her vagina for her husband to feel.  her large intestine stuck out several feet.  when i shook some green ants on it, a little went in. i shook some more. all of it went in.  when i whirled the killing stick with her heart’s blood  over her head, her head moved. when i whirled it some more, she moved  more. the third time i whirled the killing stick  she gasped for breath. she blew some breath out of her mouth, and was all right.  i said,you go eat some lilies. she  got up. i said,you will live two days.one day you will be happy.the next,sick.  she ate some lilies. she walked around, then  came back and slept. when laughing and talking women woke her she gathered her lilies and returned to camp.  the next day she walked around and played,  talked and made fun, gathering with others oysters and lilies. she brought into camp what she  gathered. that night she lay down and died.  even the gods cannot end death. in this universe anybody can kill anybody  with a stick. what the gods gave me  is their gift, the power to bury within each creature the hour it ceases.  everyone knows i have powers but not such power.  if they knew i would be so famous they would kill me.  i tell you because your tongue is stone.  if the gods ever give you words, one night in sleep you will wake to find me above you.  •  after sex &amp;

 [addressed to charles lamb, of the india house, london] well, they are gone, and here must i remain, this lime-tree bower my prison! i have lost beauties and feelings, such as would have been most sweet to my remembrance even when age had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! they, meanwhile, friends, whom i never more may meet again, on springy heath, along the hill-top edge, wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance, to that still roaring dell, of which i told; the roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep, and only speckled by the mid-day sun; where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock flings arching like a bridge;—that branchless ash, unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still, fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends behold the dark green file of long lank weeds, that all at once (a most fantastic sight!) still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge of the blue clay-stone.  now, my friends emerge beneath the wide wide heaven—and view again the many-steepled tract magnificent of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea, with some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up the slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two isles of purple shadow! yes! they wander on in gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad, my gentle-hearted charles! for thou hast pined and hunger'd after nature, many a year, in the great city pent, winning thy way with sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain and strange calamity! ah! slowly sink behind the western ridge, thou glorious sun! shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb, ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds! live in the yellow light, ye distant groves! and kindle, thou blue ocean! so my friend struck with deep joy may stand, as i have stood, silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round on the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem less gross than bodily; and of such hues as veil the almighty spirit, when yet he makes spirits perceive his presence.  a delight comes sudden on my heart, and i am glad as i myself were there! nor in this bower, this little lime-tree bower, have i not mark'd much that has sooth'd me. pale beneath the blaze hung the transparent foliage; and i watch'd some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see the shadow of the leaf and stem above dappling its sunshine! and that walnut-tree was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay full on the ancient ivy, which usurps those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue through the late twilight: and though now the bat wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters, yet still the solitary humble-bee sings in the bean-flower! henceforth i shall know that nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure; no plot so narrow, be but nature there, no waste so vacant, but may well employ each faculty of sense, and keep the heart awake to love and beauty! and sometimes 'tis well to be bereft of promis'd good, that we may lift the soul, and contemplate with lively joy the joys we cannot share. my gentle-hearted charles! when the last rook beat its straight path along the dusky air homewards, i blest it! deeming its black wing (now a dim speck, now vanishing in light) had cross'd the mighty orb's dilated glory, while thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still, flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm for thee, my gentle-hearted charles, to whom no sound is dissonant which tells of life.

 the fields are infertile as far as i can tell. their winter systems sparkle like the diamonds that pelt neptune.  limpid silvers reflect in the dark museums and theaters back in town.  to them we run to elevate our eyes to a well-shaped ethics. colors are supplied by our nervous minds.  •  towards a just and invisible image behind each substance and its place in a sentence you must have been walking.  well-defended, best when lost from wanting.  be like grass, she told me, lie flat, spring up.  •  we drop the shadows where they are then return to them when the light has grown heavy.  you’ll take your time lugging the weight into our room. or stand over there in the shade.  we’ve never been too sure that we exist as the earth does. we’re most at home in water that soaks up the letters in our brains.  it could be we have been dry too long.  a spirit is a mess when excess spoils it.  •  i see them through the slats and crack of the open window. a cold rain. leaves flipped and palsied.  the river is brown near the sand, loose banks and twigs stick at the edge and a lilac’s silhouette of a child i love.   how in the dark hole can i hide if   i can’t get outside?   then i won’t remember what i did to deserve it.   that arch and bridge will form a shape of repentance.  if  i’m hanging, then judgment has been passed.  and i am hanging  upside down head swinging towards the moon.  years of  inversion. a face in a mirror displaced by its position outside silver.  and so? next will come muscle, a little grief   but no shoulder.  •  you’re learning how to be a unit with an infinite in its attic.  it’s not difficult.  light is the last message.   white streaks like oil paint are the first to appear along the wet railing.  next similar colors correspond by chance.   we would rather be (die) with total strangers than with partial ones we realized in the elevator going down. it was the only time that day that we were as alone as we were awake.   sensing a just and impartial ghost close to each living thing i could see the genius  of  institutional religion. examine your conscience. confess in darkness and take away a task.  soon you’ll wash off flesh scented by its parallel past. what were your feet thinking in their hurry to connect the parts?  get the children to the other side! what children? you were the one running.  there was never any other.

 the mockingbird says, hallelujah, coreopsis, i make the day bright, i wake the night-blooming jasmine. i am the duodecimo of desperate love, the hocus pocus passion flower of delirious retribution. you never saw such a bird, such a triage of blood and feathers, tongue and bone. o the world is a sad address, bitterness melting the tongues of babies, breasts full of accidental milk, but i can teach the flowers to grow, take their tight buds, unfurl them like flags in the morning heat, fat banners of scent, flat platters of riot on the emerald scene. i am the green god of pine trees, conducting the music of rustling needles through a harp of wind. i am the heart of men, the wild bird that drives their sex, forges their engines, jimmies their shattered locks in the dark flare where midnight slinks. i am the careless minx in the skirts of women, the bright moon caressing their hair, the sharp words pouring from their beautiful mouths in board rooms, on bar stools, in big city laundrettes. i am lester young’s sidewinding sax, sending that pony express message out west in the marconi tube hidden in every torso tied tight in the corset of do and don’t, high and low, yes and no. i am the radio, first god of the twentieth century, broadcasting the news, the blues, the death counts, the mothers wailing when everyone’s gone home. i am sweeping through the eustachian tubes of the great plains, transmitting through every ear of corn, shimmying down the spine of every bible-thumping banker and bureaucrat, relaying the anointed word of the shimmering world. every dirty foot that walks the broken streets moves on my wings. i speak from the golden screens. hear the roar of my discord murdering the trees, screaming its furious rag, the fuselage of my revival-tent brag. open your windows, slip on your castanets. i am the flamenco in the heel of desire. i am the dancer. i am the choir. hear my wild throat crowd the exploding sky. o i can make a noise.

 nature, which is the vast creation’s soul, that steady curious agent in the whole, the art of heaven, the order of this frame, is only number in another name. for as some king conqu’ring what was his own, hath choice of several titles to his crown; so harmony on this score now, that then, yet still is all that takes and governs men. beauty is but composure, and we find content is but the concord of the mind, friendship the unison of well-turned hearts, honor the chorus of the noblest parts, and all the world on which we can reflect music to th’ear, or to the intellect. if then each man a little world must be, how many worlds are copied out in thee, who art so richly formed, so complete t’epitomize all that is good and great; whose stars this brave advantage did impart, thy nature’s as harmonious as thy art? thou dost above the poets’ praises live, who fetch from thee th’eternity they give. and as true reason triumphs over sense, yet is subjected to intelligence: so poets on the lower world look down, but lawes on them; his height is all his own. for, like divinity it self, his lyre rewards the wit it did at first inspire. and thus by double right poets allow his and their laurel should adorn his brow. live then, great soul of nature, to assuage the savage dulness of this sullen age. charm us to sense; for though experience fail and reason too, thy numbers may prevail. then, like those ancients, strike, and so command all nature to obey thy gen’rous hand. none will resist but such who needs will be more stupid than a stone, a fish, a tree. be it thy care our age to new-create: what built a world may sure repair a state.

 one against the other across the fleetingly infinite field: that dry crackling of pallid corn stalks clacking comes close to it. behind them mountains range like steppes between the tiers of fog they coddle. it's autumn coming close again and you need to compare this one to autumns past, recall the other sputters of color too good to last. something you need to say, something you come close to: wind in its limitless visits— especially in fall when it cleans the overblown trees— wind in possession of you says it best. but you go on anyway, trying to pen the breeze: this fall phenomenon different from summer's in its macabre celebration of the lifeless, in its forever rewritten memory of what comes next. sorrel leaves swirling in a whirlwind mimic your own compulsive repetition, its own circle of yearning so close to a kind of comfort. quickening conversations of geese flocking south chill through your thin skin: behind it a choir of silence undefined rows you closer to what you'll never forget, what you almost remember this time. closer to its name. the heart overtaken. the bare staves waving at boughs' ends, the musical red wings: something they almost say, more like a sense hunched in darkness, an ache, a suspicion: every time, closer to it, closer. hear hard light on the hillside flatten the visible scale into two dimensions, and you're in love with the flatted third: the way it breaks you down, over and over, to mean you are alive. the way you rub it in the wound that you never come close to wanting to close— as if you could scrub away the whirling of everything else and come down like snow to the center, the eye, so close to the purity of knowing inside this present pain, that searing white place without wind or words.

 fair tree! for thy delightful shade 'tis just that some return be made; sure some return is due from me to thy cool shadows, and to thee. when thou to birds dost shelter give, thou music dost from them receive; if travellers beneath thee stay till storms have worn themselves away, that time in praising thee they spend and thy protecting pow'r commend. the shepherd here, from scorching freed, tunes to thy dancing leaves his reed; whilst his lov'd nymph, in thanks, bestows her flow'ry chaplets on thy boughs. shall i then only silent be, and no return be made by me? no; let this wish upon thee wait, and still to flourish be thy fate. to future ages may'st thou stand untouch'd by the rash workman's hand, till that large stock of sap is spent, which gives thy summer's ornament; till the fierce winds, that vainly strive to shock thy greatness whilst alive, shall on thy lifeless hour attend, prevent the axe, and grace thy end; their scatter'd strength together call and to the clouds proclaim thy fall; who then their ev'ning dews may spare when thou no longer art their care, but shalt, like ancient heroes, burn, and some bright hearth be made thy urn.

 i think continually of those who were truly great. who, from the womb, remembered the soul’s history through corridors of light, where the hours are suns, endless and singing. whose lovely ambition was that their lips, still touched with fire, should tell of the spirit, clothed from head to foot in song. and who hoarded from the spring branches the desires falling across their bodies like blossoms.  what is precious, is never to forget the essential delight of the blood drawn from ageless springs breaking through rocks in worlds before our earth. never to deny its pleasure in the morning simple light nor its grave evening demand for love. never to allow gradually the traffic to smother with noise and fog, the flowering of the spirit.  near the snow, near the sun, in the highest fields, see how these names are fêted by the waving grass and by the streamers of white cloud and whispers of wind in the listening sky. the names of those who in their lives fought for life, who wore at their hearts the fire’s centre. born of the sun, they travelled a short while toward the sun and left the vivid air signed with their honour.

 i went to turn the grass once after one who mowed it in the dew before the sun.  the dew was gone that made his blade so keen before i came to view the levelled scene.  i looked for him behind an isle of trees; i listened for his whetstone on the breeze.  but he had gone his way, the grass all mown, and i must be, as he had been,—alone,  ‘as all must be,’ i said within my heart, ‘whether they work together or apart.’  but as i said it, swift there passed me by on noiseless wing a ‘wildered butterfly,  seeking with memories grown dim o’er night some resting flower of yesterday’s delight.  and once i marked his flight go round and round, as where some flower lay withering on the ground.  and then he flew as far as eye could see, and then on tremulous wing came back to me.  i thought of questions that have no reply, and would have turned to toss the grass to dry;  but he turned first, and led my eye to look at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,  a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared.  i left my place to know them by their name, finding them butterfly weed when i came.  the mower in the dew had loved them thus, by leaving them to flourish, not for us,  nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him. but from sheer morning gladness at the brim.  the butterfly and i had lit upon, nevertheless, a message from the dawn,  that made me hear the wakening birds around, and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,  and feel a spirit kindred to my own; so that henceforth i worked no more alone;  but glad with him, i worked as with his aid, and weary, sought at noon with him the shade;  and dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach.  ‘men work together,’ i told him from the heart, ‘whether they work together or apart.’

 startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor’s mutt, it banged its buzzard’s head then couldn’t solve the problem of the white pine’s limbs with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. somewhere an awkward angel knows whether it was dead before it hit the ground. any sinner could tell it was dead after— eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids, feet drawn up almost as high as hands. i loved to watch thistle and millet disappear beneath it in the yard. as snow covers feathers that will still be iridescent in the spring i remember seeing a businessman take a dripping handful of pocket change and throw it down a subway grate beside a homeless man. the coins bounced and clattered, vanishing in the humid dark. the rich man said now you’re having a shitty day too. but it’s not a shitty day and won’t be when i retrieve the bird and walk it— toes curling stiff from a shopping bag— to a houseless scrap of oak savannah birdseed drew it from and dig it into deeper snow so what was hoarded by a man may by the thaw be doled.

 not rain, but fine mist falls from my lemon tree, a balm of droplets in green shadow.  six years now my mother gone to earth. this dew, light as footsteps of the dead. she often walked out here, craned her neck, considered the fruit, hundreds of globes in their leathery hides, figuring on custard and pudding, meringue and hollandaise.  but her plans didn't work out.  the tree goes on unceasingly—lemons fall and fold into earth and begin again— me, i come here as a salve against heat, come to languish, to let the soft bursts— essence of citrus, summer's distillate— drift into my face and settle. water and gold brew in the quiet deeps at the far end of the season. leaves swallow the body of light and the breath of water brims over.  my hands cup each other the way hers did.

 people looking at the sea, makes them feel less terrible about themselves, the sea's behaving abominably, seems never satisfied, what it throws away it dashes down then wants back, yanks back. comparatively, thinks one vice president, what are my frauds but nudged along misunderstandings already there? i can't believe i ever worried about my betrayals, thinks the analyst benefitting facially from the sea's raged-up mist. obviously i'm not the only one suffering an identity crisis knows the boy who wants to be a lawyer no more. nothing can stay long, cogitates the dog, so maybe a life of fetch is not a wasted life. and the sea heaves and cleaves and seethes, shoots snot out, goes to bed only to wake shouting in the mansion of the night, pacing, pacing, making tea then spilling it, sudden outloud laughter snort, oh what the heck, i probably drove myself crazy, thinks the sea, kissing all those strangers, forgiving them no matter what, liars in confession, vomitters of plastics and fossil fuels but what a stricken elixir i've become even to my becalmed depths, while through its head swim a million fishes seemingly made of light eating each other.  
NEW POEM
 a grand piano wrapped in quilted pads by movers, tied up with canvas straps—like classical music’s birthday gift to the criminally insane—is gently nudged without its legs out an eighth-floor window on 62nd street.  it dangles in april air from the neck of the movers’ crane, chopin-shiny black lacquer squares and dirty white crisscross patterns hanging like the second-to-last note of a concerto played on the edge of the seat, the edge of tears, the edge of eight stories up going over—it's a piano being pushed out of a window and lowered down onto a flatbed truck!— and i’m trying to teach math in the building across the street.  who can teach when there are such lessons to be learned? all the greatest common factors are delivered by long-necked cranes and flatbed trucks or come through everything, even air. like snow.  see, snow falls for the first time every year, and every year my students rush to the window as if snow were more interesting than math, which, of course, it is.  so please.  let me teach like a steinway, spinning slowly in april air, so almost-falling, so hinderingly dangling from the neck of the movers’ crane. so on the edge of losing everything.  let me teach like the first snow, falling.  
NEW POEM
 but it is not always quiet here. things go on while we sleep the sleep of soldiers.  ancient branches crack and splinter into dust. large wings snap open in spring like carpets splayed out over the railing.  granite splits apart at the seams and great animals cleave roads through woods.  daily, in the density, there is life on the edge of the knife that cuts the world into hemispheres of sense and death.  trees are born and die, bones turn to humus, glaciers to meadowland. it is time  to turn yourself loose, like new leaves, like big lakes on which swim enormous birds at a distance deeper in breadth than the water's depth.  their shadows pull you to the shore. their size fills your lungs with sky. it is time  to heave aside the boulders and the dams, to come back out like a bear after the thaw, to be ready for the forest, for the forage, for the full  and waning moons. you will get soaked in wet grass, feel the insects pierce your skin. you will learn  to balance between gravity and light. there will be hot and sticky nights, sharp songs at dawn, long and bright ineffable days.  this is your chance to crash your way through underbrush unlocking like so many doors.

 i would have come. when you called. but. i had the most beautiful pale pink rose. its healthy stem was clenched between my teeth. and. its thorns bit sharply into my tender wet flesh. so.  i couldn't answer you. still. my lips moved at you silently. they offered words you never heard. they screamed inside my crazed brain. only. it could do nothing for you.  in time the petals wilted. they blew away. and. they became compost in someone else's garden. the tough, fibrous stem withered. i bit down hard to snap its grip on me. then.  my teeth fell out. its thorns had burrowed into my cheeks. they had implanted themselves permanently. they were suckling on my softest tissues. and. not long after they sprouted tiny shoots.  they coiled their way down. i still held the memory of your call. and. the long stemmed beauty lodged next to it. they cleaved unto the long roots curling down my neck. my body held tight and listened. hard.

 every seaworthy vessel a woman whose mate, eloquent of how she handled under the worst of weathers, hailed his goddess of wet fire, handmaid and dockside whore.  over the courtyard’s dry dock, linens snapped. brisk was the wind that claimed divine right to salvage whatever tore loose, brisk at the docks the trade  in foreign plumage, and the milliner, arms full of wings, who tripped in a puddle that brimmed with sky. past the known world, past the map that decorated a room  with scalloped waters where ships the size of fingernail parings were never snagged by the dragon-sharp islands, a keel of leaf scraped across a pane.  a branch scratched endearments on the air it then brushed clean as sand. had the woman rereading a letter looked to the window casting her light,  she could have seen almost to land’s end, the salt sea broken into semaphore flashing its glassy code for tears back to shore, seen almost to the cage on deck,  the pigeons gray as the mind, some to bear messages home the first days out, the rest to fatten in the hold.

 as in green,vert, a royal demesne stocked with deer.invert as in tipped as a snow globe, going nowhere in circles but not lost, not bereft as the wood without deer, waiting for the white antlered buck, or his does, or any slim yearling to step along the berm, return.vertigo as in whirling round,swimming in the head, unanchored by the long spring, the horse cantering, the meadow dropping like an elevator into the earth, falling like persephone through a crevice, a swiveling crack, a loose screw, a lost way.disordered as in death lasts, my brother’s not coming back. the spin of it continuous as in looking down from height, and then it stops, the spinning just slows, a chariot wheel stilled in grass. the world is the same, but it isn’t. the tipped views of trees when hanging from your knees. the deer in twos and threes watching.  
NEW POEM
 i seem to wake and sleep ambiguously, to see and misconceive, to feel on the brink of something that doesn’t end, beauty that is more than beautiful, meaning that is more.   the present is all around me, dreams, a panoply of crimes, smudges of erasure, memory made of clouds, camels, weasels and the unlikelihood of somewhere within and beyond this world.   here’s light, angular, ubiquitous with the milky pigments of belief. here’s plodding time, breathing hard. birds fly up, perch on branches, peck seed from the grass, (tug worms from the soil). i am not what i imagined, here i am the illusionist and dupe of my illusions, making the angels disappear, wishing them back again.   stories that shifted in the telling once were true: a virgin birth, a resurrection, a tiger who regained his human form, a crocodile who didn’t. i’m pitching words against the sea, it drags them out, flings them back again still freighted with my weight. the waves are red with blood,   brown with shit, yellow with the sickly light, anything but blue and green. i am an insistent fizz and drone, deft, adroit, as elastic as necessity and chance,   one more clay figurine with beseeching hollows where the eyes should be, as different from the others as i am the same, no more evolved than a roach, no better than a rat, happy as a labrador in the sun. this is grace, the rest is commentary and i would let it go: in millennia   i’ll chatter metaphysics with a chimpanzee, now my thoughts are the antlers of the irish elk, the wings of flightless birds, peptides spelling out the phrase very like a whale. most organisms   produce more offspring than can possibly survive. nothing can follow that. something will. blunt heads of rain, faithless wind, the stricken sun at dusk,   knock-kneed girls somersaulting on the beach, the commonplace surprise of making love face to face, the heart breaking apart, an instrumental eye and instrumental mind rejoicing, a last cacophony of birds.

 green miles of leafy peace are spread over these ranks, unseen and serried; screening the trenches with their dead and living men already buried. the rains beat down, the torrents flow into each cold and huddling cave; and over them the beet-fields grow, a fortress gentle as a grave.  “morose, impatient, sick at heart, with rasping nerves and twitching muscles, we cannot even sleep; we start with every twig that snaps or rustles. sought always by an unseen foe over our heads the bullets fly; but more than these, we fear the snow, the silent shrapnel of the sky.  “yonder our colonel stalks and grieves, meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy; but we, we sit and watch the leaves fall down, a torn and crumpled army. we mourn for every leaf that lies, as though it were a comrade slain; each was a shelter from the eyes of every prying aeroplane. . . ”

 a heron-like species, rare visitors, most recent records referring to winter months . . . very active at dusk. —guide to irish birds a sobering thought, the idea of you stretched there, bittern, under a dark sky, your exposed bones yellow too in a ditch among cold stones, ice glittering everywhere on bog and river, the whole unfortunate country frozen over and your voice stilled by enforced sobriety — a thought more wrenching than the fall of troy because more intimate; for we’d hear your shout of delight from a pale patch of watery sunlight out on the mud there as you took your first drink of the day and now, destroyed by thirst, you lie in brambles while the rats rotate. i’d’ve broken the ice for you, given an inkling; now, had i known it, we might both be drinking and singing too; for ours is the same story. others have perished — heron, blackbird, thrushes — and lie shivering like you under whin-bushes; but i mourn only the bittern, withdrawn and solitary, who used to carouse alone among the rushes and sleep rough in the star-glimmering bog-drain. it used to be, with characters like us, they’d let us wander the roads in wind and rain or lock us up and throw away the key — but now they have a cure for these psychoses as indeed they do for most social diseases and, rich at last, we can forget our pain. she says i’m done for if i drink again; so now, relieved of dangerous stimuli, as peace with my plastic bottle of h 2 o and the slack strings of insouciance, i sit with bronze kavanagh on his canal-bank seat not in ‘the tremendous silence of mid-july’ but the fast bright zing of a winter afternoon dizzy with head-set, flash-bulb and digifone, to learn the tao he once claimed as his own and share with him the moor-hen and the swan, the thoughtless lyric of a cloud in the sky and the play of light and shadow on the slow commemorative waters; relax, go with the flow.  
NEW POEM
 the village life, and every care that reigns o'er youthful peasants and declining swains; what labour yields, and what, that labour past, age, in its hour of languor, finds at last; what forms the real picture of the poor, demands a song—the muse can give no more. fled are those times, if e'er such times were seen, when rustic poets praised their native green; no shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse, their country's beauty or their nymphs' rehearse; yet still for these we frame the tender strain, still in our lays fond corydons complain, and shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal, the only pains, alas! they never feel. on mincio's banks, in caesar's bounteous reign, if tityrus found the golden age again, must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong, mechanic echoes of the mantuan song? from truth and nature shall we widely stray, where virgil, not where fancy, leads the way? yes, thus the muses sing of happy swains, because the muses never knew their pains. they boast their peasants' pipes, but peasants now resign their pipes and plod behind the plough; and few amid the rural tribe have time to number syllables and play with rhyme; save honest duck, what son of verse could share the poet's rapture and the peasant's care? or the great labours of the field degrade with the new peril of a poorer trade? from one chief cause these idle praises spring, that themes so easy few forbear to sing; they ask no thought, require no deep design, but swell the song and liquefy the line; the gentle lover takes the rural strain, a nymph his mistress and himself a swain; with no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer, but all, to look like her, is painted fair. i grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms for him that gazes or for him that farms; but when amid such pleasing scenes i trace the poor laborious natives of the place, and see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray, on their bare heads and dewy temples play; while some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts, deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts: then shall i dare these real ills to hide in tinsel trappings of poetic pride? no, cast by fortune on a frowning coast, which can no groves nor happy valleys boast; where other cares than those the muse relates, and other shepherds dwell with other mates; by such examples taught, i paint the cot, as truth will paint it, and as bards will not: nor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn complain, to you the smoothest song is smooth in vain; o'ercome by labour and bowed down by time, feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme? can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread, by winding myrtles round your ruined shed? can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower, or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour? lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er, lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor; from thence a length of burning sand appears, where the thin harvest waves its withered ears; rank weeds, that every art and care defy, reign o'er the land and rob the blighted rye: there thistles stretch their prickly arms afar, and to the ragged infant threaten war; there poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil, there the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil; hardy and high, above the slender sheaf, the slimy mallow waves her silky leaf; o'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade, and the wild tare clings round the sickly blade; with mingled tints the rocky coasts abound, and a sad splendor vainly shines around. so looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn, betrayed by man, then left for man to scorn; whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose while her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose; whose outward splendour is but folly's dress, exposing most, when most it gilds distress. here joyless roam a wild amphibious race, with sullen woe displayed in every face; who far from civil arts and social fly, and scowl at strangers with suspicious eye. here too the lawless merchant of the main draws from his plough th' intoxicated swain; want only claimed the labor of the day, but vice now steals his nightly rest away. where are the swains, who, daily labor done, with rural games played down the setting sun; who struck with matchless force the bounding ball, or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall; while some huge ajax, terrible and strong, engaged some artful stripling of the throng, and, foiled, beneath the young ulysses fell, when peals of praise the merry mischief tell? where now are these?—beneath yon cliff they stand, to show the freighted pinnace where to land; to load the ready steed with guilty haste; to fly in terror o'er the pathless waste, or, when detected in their straggling course, to foil their foes by cunning or by force; or, yielding part (when equal knaves contest), to gain a lawless passport for the rest. here, wand'ring long amid these frowning fields, i sought the simple life that nature yields; rapine and wrong and fear usurped her place, and a bold, artful, surly, savage race; who, only skilled to take the finny tribe, the yearly dinner, or septennial bribe wait on the shore and, as the waves run high, on the tossed vessel bend their eager eye, which to their coast directs its vent'rous way, theirs, or the ocean's, miserable prey. as on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand, and wait for favoring winds to leave the land; while still for flight the ready wing is spread: so waited i the favouring hour, and fled; fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign, and cried, ah! hapless they who still remain; who still remain to hear the ocean roar, whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore; till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway, sweeps the low hut and all it holds away; when the sad tenant weeps from door to door, and begs a poor protection from the poor! but these are scenes where nature's niggard hand gave a spare portion to the famished land; hers is the fault, if here mankind complain of fruitless toil and labor spent in vain; but yet in other scenes, more fair in view, where plenty smiles—alas! she smiles for few and those who taste not, yet behold her store, are as the slaves that dig the golden ore, the wealth around them makes them doubly poor. or will you deem them amply paid in health, labor's fair child, that languishes with wealth? go then! and see them rising with the sun, through a long course of daily toil to run; like him to make the plenteous harvest grow, and yet not shard the plenty they bestow; see them beneath the dog-star's raging heat, when the knees tremble and the temples beat; behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er the labour past, and toils to come explore; see them alternate suns and showers engage, and hoard up aches and anguish for their age; through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue, when their warm pores imbibe the evening dew; then own that labour may as fatal be to these thy slaves, as luxury to thee. amid this tribe too oft a manly pride strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide; there may you see the youth of slender frame contend with weakness, weariness, and shame: yet urged along, and proudly loth to yield, he strives to join his fellows of the field; till long-contending nature droops at last, declining health rejects his poor repast, his cheerless spouse the coming danger sees, and mutual murmurs urge the slow disease. yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell, though the head droops not, that the heart is well; or will you urge their homely, plenteous fare, healthy and plain and still the poor man's share! oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel, nor mock the misery of a stinted meal; homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such as you who envy would disdain to touch. ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease, whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please; go! if the peaceful cot your praises share, go, look within, and ask if peace be there: if peace be his—that drooping weary sire, or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire, or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand. nor yet can time itself obtain for these life's latest comforts, due respect and ease; for yonder see that hoary swain, whose age can with no cares except his own engage; who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to see the bare arms broken from the withering tree, on which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough, then his first joy, but his sad emblem now. he once was chief in all the rustic trade, his steady hand the straightest furrow made; full many a prize he won, and still is proud to find the triumphs of his youth allowed. a transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes, he hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs: for now he journeys to his grave in pain; the rich disdain him, nay, the poor disdain; alternate masters now their slave command, and urge the efforts of his feeble hand; who, when his age attempts its task in vain, with ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain. oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep, his winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep; oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow o'er his white locks and bury them in snow; when, roused by rage and muttering in the morn, he mends the broken hedge with icy thorn: "why do i live, when i desire to be at once from life and life's long labour free? like leaves in spring, the young are blown away, without the sorrows of a slow decay; i, like yon withered leaf, remain behind, nipped by the frost, and shivering in the wind; there it abides till younger buds come on, as i, now all my fellow-swains are gone; then, from the rising generation thrust, it falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust. "these fruitful fields, these numerous flocks i see, are others' gain, but killing cares to me; to me the children of my youth are lords, slow in their gifts but hasty in their words: wants of their own demand their care, and who feels his own want and succors others too? a lonely, wretched man, in pain i go, none need my help and none relieve my woe; then let my bones beneath the turf be laid, and men forget the wretch they would not aid." thus groan the old, till, by disease oppressed, they taste a final woe, and then they rest. theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor, whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door; there, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play, and the dull wheel hums doleful through the day; there children dwell, who know no parents' care, parents, who know no children's love, dwell there; heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed, forsaken wives, and mothers never wed; dejected widows with unheeded tears, and crippled age with more than childhood-fears; the lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they! the moping idiot and the madman gay. here too the sick their final doom receive, here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve, where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow, mixed with the clamors of the crowd below; here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan, and the cold charities of man to man: whose laws indeed for ruined age provide, and strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride; but still that scrap is bought with many a sigh, and pride embitters what it can't deny. say ye, oppressed by some fantastic woes, some jarring nerve that baffles your repose; who press the downy couch, while slaves advance with timid eye to read the distant glance; who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease to name the nameless ever-new disease; who with mock patience dire complaints endure, which real pain, and that alone, can cure; how would ye bear in real pain to lie, despised, neglected, left alone to die? how would ye bear to draw your latest breath, where all that's wretched paves the way for death? such is that room which one rude beam divides, and naked rafters form the sloping sides; where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen, and lath and mud is all that lie between; save one dull pane, that, coarsely patched, gives way to the rude tempest, yet excludes the day. here, on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread, the drooping wretch reclines his languid head; for him no hand the cordial cup applies, nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes; no friends with soft discourse his pain beguile, nor promise hope till sickness wears a smile. but soon a loud and hasty summons calls, shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls. anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat, all pride and business, bustle and conceit; with looks unaltered by these scenes of woe, with speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go, he bids the gazing throng around him fly, and carries fate and physic in his eye; a potent quack, long versed in human ills, who first insults the victim whom he kills; whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench protect, and whose most tender mercy is neglect. paid by the parish for attendance here, he wears contempt upon his sapient sneer; in haste he seeks the bed where misery lies, impatience marked in his averted eyes; and, some habitual queries hurried o'er, without reply, he rushes on the door: his drooping patient, long inured to pain, and long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain; he ceases now the feeble help to crave of man, and mutely hastens to the grave. but ere his death some pious doubts arise, some simple fears, which "bold bad" men despise; fain would he ask the parish priest to prove his title certain to the joys above; for this he sends the murmuring nurse, who calls the holy stranger to these dismal walls; and doth not he, the pious man, appear, he, "passing rich with forty pounds a year"? ah! no; a shepherd of a different stock, and far unlike him, feeds this little flock: a jovial youth, who thinks his sunday's task as much as god or man can fairly ask; the rest he gives to loves and labors light, to fields the morning and to feasts the night; none better skilled the noisy pack to guide, to urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide; sure in his shot, his game he seldom missed, and seldom failed to win his game at whist; then, while such honors bloom around his head, shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bed to raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal to combat fears that ev'n the pious feel now once again the gloomy scene explore, less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o'er, the man of many sorrows sighs no more. up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow the bier moves winding from the vale below; there lie the happy dead, from trouble free, and the glad parish pays the frugal fee. no more, oh death! thy victim starts to hear churchwarden stern, or kingly overseer; no more the farmer gets his humble bow, thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou! now to the church behold the mourners come, sedately torpid and devoutly dumb; the village children now their games suspend, to see the bier that bears their ancient friend: for he was one in all their idle sport, and like a monarch ruled their little court; the pliant bow he formed, the flying ball, the bat, the wicket, were his labours all; him now they follow to his grave, and stand silent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand; while bending low, their eager eyes explore the mingled relics of the parish poor. the bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round, fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound; the busy priest, detained by weightier care, defers his duty till the day of prayer; and, waiting long, the crowd retire distressed, to think a poor man's bones should lie unblessed.  
NEW POEM
 sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, the bridal of the earth and sky; the dew shall weep thy fall to-night, for thou must die.  sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave bids the rash gazer wipe his eye; thy root is ever in its grave, and thou must die.  sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses, a box where sweets compacted lie; my music shows ye have your closes, and all must die.  only a sweet and virtuous soul, like season'd timber, never gives; but though the whole world turn to coal, then chiefly lives.

 1once in mexico an old man was leading on a string—was it a cat? and we saw it was a tarantula sidling along in the dust, writing a message from god for people who thought they knew where creature-life ended.  2we came upon scenes like that, the world back of a lurid pane of glass. like in reno—they have emptied hollywood and ordered the extras and the stars to go get married and divorced in reno, making up their stories as they go and letting their little dogs decide which machines or churches to put nickels and dimes into.  3one day in a cut quick to the bone it was white, white; and then the world came in. i got a tourniquet going, but the snow had learned a whole new way to look at the sky, as in maryland in the red fields, how the stones come startlingly white, on the battlefields, the cemeteries, along the gouged-out roads. there history blows about on dandelion seeds.  4on the plains near wakeeney, above the ground, short of the earth, at the level of the eyes, a sunset ray extended for miles. we drove along it, and let our thoughts down gingerly to touch what happened, where genevieve lived. she went out of the world, for death. her town holds quiet in the big plain. lights witness one by one all over what still abides. there was no one better. her town, her town, her town, the tires repeat as we go by.  5for those my friends who want me to know, to discover and combine: all my best thoughts i roll up and let fall carelessly. it is better than no one follow even the pattern i look onto the back of my hand, for many visions i haven’t dared follow may gather and combine in a flash. away off. in a space in the sky, i let the sky look at me, and i look back and do not say anything.  
NEW POEM
 'twas the night before christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; the stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that st. nicholas soon would be there; the children were nestled all snug in their beds; while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; and mamma in her 'kerchief, and i in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap, when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. away to the window i flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. the moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, gave a lustre of midday to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes did appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer, with a little old driver so lively and quick, i knew in a moment he must be st. nick. more rapid than eagles his coursers they came, and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: "now,dasher! now,dancer! now prancer and vixen! on,comet! on,cupid! on,donner and blitzen! to the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! now dash away! dash away! dash away all!" as leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; so up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleigh full of toys, and st. nicholas too— and then, in a twinkling, i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. as i drew in my head, and was turning around, down the chimney st. nicholas came with a bound. he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; a bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a pedler just opening his pack. his eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry! his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath; he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. he was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and i laughed when i saw him, in spite of myself; a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread; he spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; he sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. but i heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight— “happy christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

NEW POEM
 you yearn so much you could be a yacht. your mind has already set sail. it takes a few days to arrive  at island pace, but soon you are barefoot on the sand, the slim waves testing your feet  like health professionals. you toe shells, sea glass, and odd things that have drifted for years and finally washed up here.  you drop your towel and step out of your togs, ungainly, first your right foot, then  the other stepping down the sand to stand in the water.  there is no discernible difference in temperature. you breaststroke in the lazy blue.  a guy passing in a rowboat says, “beautiful, isn’t it?” and it is. your body afloat in salt as if cured.  
NEW POEM
 inside the veins there are navies setting forth, tiny explosions at the waterlines, and seagulls weaving in the wind of the salty blood.  it is the morning. the country has slept the whole winter. window seats were covered with fur skins, the yard was full of stiff dogs, and hands that clumsily held heavy books.  now we wake, and rise from bed, and eat breakfast! shouts rise from the harbor of the blood, mist, and masts rising, the knock of wooden tackle in the sunlight.  now we sing, and do tiny dances on the kitchen floor. our whole body is like a harbor at dawn; we know that our master has left us for the day.  
NEW POEM
 look, above the creek, hummingbirds in the trumpet vine. not too close, wait. see the green blurs stitching the leaves?  here at the edge of the millennium i don’t imagine you’d call them anything as archaic as angels.  but aren’t they agents of a sort, and secret, dissolving and solidifying, spying from their constantly shifting perches of air, always nervous of us, risking only a stab in a bell of petals?  don’t look so stunned, lay your pack in the needles and catch a breath. i know, you thought you knew me, and now to hear me talk this way ...  i’m glad i’ve stopped pretending to love people and the cities where people can’t love themselves. this is what the quiet accomplishes, and the water trusting the shadows to eventually peel back to the trees.  small wonder the angels are said to despise us. still, without them how do we account for our meanness?  look at that, what else can promenade in the air? and how easily they’re alarmed, revving off into the mist.

 walking down park amsterdam or columbus do you ever stop to think what it looked like before it was an avenue did you ever stop to think what you walked before you rode subways to the stock exchange (we can’t be on the stock exchange we are the stock exchanged)  did you ever maybe wonder what grass was like before they rolled it into a ball and called it central park where syphilitic dogs and their two-legged tubercular masters fertilize the corners and side-walks ever want to know what would happen if your life could be fertilized by a love thought from a loved one who loves you  ever look south on a clear day and not see time’s squares but see tall birch trees with sycamores touching hands and see gazelles running playfully after the lions ever hear the antelope bark from the third floor apartment  ever, did you ever, sit down and wonder about what freedom’s freedom would bring it’s so easy to be free you start by loving yourself then those who look like you all else will come naturally  ever wonder why so much asphalt was laid in so little space probably so we would forget the iroquois, algonquin and mohicans who could caress the earth  ever think what harlem would be like if our herbs and roots and elephant ears grew sending a cacophony of sound to us the parrot parroting black is beautiful black is beautiful owls sending out whooooo’s making love ... and me and you just sitting in the sun trying to find a way to get a banana tree from one of the monkeys koala bears in the trees laughing at our listlessness  ever think its possible for us to be happy

 it was the fruit i wanted, not the nest. the nest was hanging like the richest fruit against the sun. i took the nest  and with it came the heart, and in my hand the kingdom and the queen, frail surfaces, rested for a moment. then the drones  awoke and did their painful business. i let the city drop upon the stones. it split to its deep palaces and combs.  it bled the insect gold, the pupa queens like tiny eyes wriggled from their sockets, and somewhere  the monarch cowered in a veil of wings in passages through which at evening the labourers had homed,  burdened with silence and the garden scents. the secret heart was broken suddenly. i, to whom the knowledge had been given,  who was not after knowledge but a fruit, remember how a knot of pains swelled my hand to a round nest;  blood throbbed in the hurt veins as if an unseen swarm mined there. the nest oozed bitter honey.  i swaddled my fat hand in cotton. after a week pain gave it back to me scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin.  a second fruit is growing on the tree. identical—the droning in the leaves. it ripens. i have another hand.

 spout of a leaf, listen out for the screams of your relentless audience: the applause of a waterfall in the distance,  a hurricane looting a miami shopping mall. how careful you are with the rain-cradling curve of your back.  near your forest, all are ready to swim and happy to drown in me: this lake of fire that moats the edges.  from my mouth, they come to peel the flames and drink their slick throats into the most silent of ashes.

 the incoherent rushing of the train dulls like a drugged pain  numbs to an ether throbbing of inaudible drums  unfolds hush within hush until the night withholds  only its darkness. from the deep dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep  slowly a strange name in a strange tongue.  among  the sleeping listeners a sound as leaves stir faintly on the ground  when snow falls from a windless sky— a stir    a sigh

 we are the knife people, iron men, coat people and he-lands-sailing. souse eaters, house makers, husbands of kine and goat and swine, farm builders and keepers of kettle and scummer, word scratchers, corn stealers and bad sleepers.  as if towns could build themselves. as if stumps jumped from the ground or flesh of beasts fell into trenchers. as if paradise prevailed on earth. to come to rich moulds and lush plantings, long-necked trees and tongues of land,  to redd the wild for the unborn. to reck not the peril. suffering snakes that may fly, wolves that may ravish. kingdom of sachem and sagamore. kingdom of corn and thorny promise.  to satisfy our appetite of spirit, our thirst of property. to seek not the opera of war but belittled by the possibilities to stand silenced by the task before us—  these be my sudden and undigested thoughts.  
NEW POEM
 an axe rang sharply ’mid those forest shades which from creation toward the skies had tower’d in unshorn beauty. there, with vigorous arm wrought a bold emigrant, and by his side his little son, with question and response, beguiled the toil. ‘boy, thou hast never seen such glorious trees. hark, when their giant trunks fall, how the firm earth groans. rememberest thou the mighty river, on whose breast we sail’d, so many days, on toward the setting sun? our own connecticut, compar’d to that, was but a creeping stream.’ ‘father, the brook that by our door went singing, where i launch’d my tiny boat, with my young playmates round, when school was o’er, is dearer far to me, than all these bold, broad waters. to my eye they are as strangers. and those little trees my mother nutur’d in the garden bound, of our first home, from whence the fragrant peach hung in its ripening gold, were fairer sure, than this dark forest, shutting out the day.’ —‘what, ho! – my little girl,’ and with light step a fairy creature hasted toward her sire, and setting down the basket that contain’d his noon-repast, look’d upward to his face with sweet, confiding smile. ‘see, dearest, see, that bright-wing’d paroquet, and hear the song of yon gay red-bird, echoing through the trees, making rich music. didst thou ever hear, in far new england, such a mellow tone?’ —‘i had a robin that did take the crumbs each night and morning, and his chirping voice still made me joyful, as i went to tend my snow-drops. i was always laughing then in that first home. i should be happier now methinks, if i could find among these dells the same fresh violets.’ slow night drew on, and round the rude hut of the emigrant the wrathful spirit of the rising storm spake bitter things. his weary children slept, and he, with head declin’d, sat listening long to the swoln waters of the illinois, dashing against their shores. starting he spake,— ‘wife! did i see thee brush away a tear? ’twas even so. thy heard was with the halls of thy nativity. their sparkling lights, carpets, and sofas, and admiring guests, befit thee better than these rugged walls of shapeless logs, and this lone, hermit home.’ ‘no – no. all was so still around, methought upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal, which ’mid the church where erst we paid our vows, so tuneful peal’d. but tenderly thy voice dissolv’d the illusion.’ and the gentle smile lighting her brow, the fond caress that sooth’d her waking infant, reassur’d his soul that wheresoe’er our best affections dwell, and strike a healthful root, is happiness. content, and placid, to his rest he sank, but dreams, those wild magicians, that do play such pranks when reason slumbers, tireless wrought their will with him. up rose the thronging mart of his own native city, – roof and spire, all glittering bright, in fancy’s frost-work ray. the steed his boyhood nurtur’d proudly neigh’d, the favorite dog came frisking round his feet, with shrill and joyous bark, – familiar doors flew open, – greeting hands with his were link’d in friendship’s grasp, – he heard the keen debate from congregated haunts, where mind with mind doth blend and brighten, – and till morning rov’d ’mid the loved scenery of his native land.

 there's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted who disappeared into those shadows.  i've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled this isn't a russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, its own ways of making people disappear.  i won't tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods meeting the unmarked strip of light— ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: i know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.  and i won't tell you where it is, so why do i tell you anything? because you still listen, because in times like these to have you listen at all, it's necessary to talk about trees.

 today i’m thinking of st. paul—st. paul, who orders us,be perfect. he could have said, touch your elbow to your ears, except that if you broke your arm, then snapped your neck, you might could manage it. the death inside the flawed hard currency of what we touch bamboozles us, existing only for that flaw, that deathward plunge that’s locked inside all form, till what seems solid floats away, dissolves, and these poor bastard things, no longer things, drift back to pure idea. and when, at last, we let them go we start to pity them, attend their needs: i almost have to think to keep my own heart beating through the night. i have a wife and four pink boys. i spin on all this stupid metaphysic now because last afternoon we visited some friends in town. after the pecan pie, i drank until my forehead smacked the table, and woke to find my shirt crusted with blood. when mary didn’t yell at me, i knew she finally understood that i was gone, dissolving back. as we rode home, i tried to say,i’m sorry, hon. the carriage bucked across the mud-dried ruts and i shut up. and she, in august heat, just sat, head cocked as if for chills hidden in the hot, damp breeze, as if they were a sound, time merely distance. o death, i know exactly where it is— your sting. and, grave, i know your victory. that night, around the tents, the boys caught fireflies, pinched them in half, and smeared them on their nails, then ran through pine-dark woods, waving their hands. all i could hear was laughter, shouts. and all that i could see for each one of my sons were ten blurs of faint, artificial light, never too far apart, and trembling. like fairies, magic, sprites, they ran and shouted, “i’m not real! i’m not real!” the whole world fell away from me—perhaps i was still drunk— as on the night titania told dazed bottom, “put off your human grossness so, and like an airy spirit go.” but even then the night could not hold long against the light, and light destroys roots, fog, lies, orchids, night, dawn stars, the moon, delusions, and most magic. and light sends into hiding owls, fireflies, and bats, whom for their unerring blunder, i adore the most of all night fliers. but owls, hid in a hickory, will hoot all day, and even the moon persists, like my hangover, some days till almost noon, drifting above the harsh, bright, murderous morning light—so blue, so valuable, so much like currency that if the moon were my blue coin, i’d never spend it.

 the wrong words sit beside us where the flesh is heavy. the right words come most easily to those who sleep. i put my boots in a cvs bag because the weather demanded it and my jacket over the windshield in the morning to confuse the sun. of mine own life, i'll tell you one thing the internet won't tell you—i wear my hair like a woman sometimes. the project of the snow's to put the sky in lo-fi and the memory of last week's snow's a gash in the air. the mountains and seas have a queer look about them. a hoax of golden daffodils obscures them, you might say. i've been told we should pretend that everything we see is real, that images should try as best they can to come to life. i feel that iron should take the place of snow in the literature and that silk flowers should be manufactured like real ones each spring. i'm reading the letters of distinguished men to you. a broadside of a bad poem on very good paper. a treatise on how to infuse brandy with plums. my fat ass surveys the greensward and when i step in the manner befitting a person of little station in the world the dandelions seem to vanish in retrospect as though to die were just to overlook the rituals that accompany the death and life of weeds and to fold oneself back into one's roots. i am so big i mean my ass is so big i can't fit in this room i'm building. my ass can barely fit without assistance through the door of this stanza which is why i invented the pronoun "you." the streetlamps seemed to you to want to break apart the clouds so we left the city, are always in the process of abandoning a city somewhere. some days now you'll find us trolling the hillsides for wildflowers. other times, sitting at the very center of our garden, googling "beauty" with the filter off.

 not one star, not even the half moon on the night you were born not the flash of salmon nor ridges on blue snow not the flicker of raven’s never-still eye not breath frozen in fine hairs beading the bull moose’s nostril not one hand under flannel warming before reaching not burbot at home under tanana ice not burbot pulled up into failing light not the knife blade honed, not the leather sheath not raw bawling in the dog yard when the musher barks gee not the gnawed ends of wrist-thick sticks mounded over beaver dens not solar flares scouring the earth over china not rime crystals bearding a sleek cheek of snow not six minutes more of darkness each day not air water food words touch not art not anything we expect not anything we expect to keep not anything we expect to keep us alive  not the center of the sea not the birthplace of the waves not the compass too close to true north to guide us  then with no warning flukes of three orcas rise, arc clear of sea water

 wheal emma and brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near buckfastleigh, within the dartmoor national park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. from this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. in 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, wheal emma leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the river swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the mardle, a tributary of the dart. some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on dartmoor. i am grateful to kevin and donna cox, owners of the brook manor estate, for showing my collaborator, ignacio acosta , and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.  widening the plug doorway on the bob wall left no surface evidence. the mardle has a floodplain fair and wide. material would have been trammed directly, although blacked ochreous water flows freely from the collapsed portal. humphrey kept kevin back when we went into the near horizontal dark adit stooped at the panic shaft.  in brook wood at the combe head is a small killas quarry predating all three setts. rent was paid to the brook wood adventurers. three areas of dumping partially covered this crumbled masonry within woodland of varying density just south of the tarmac road. yet a leat is depicted on the 1886 os map channeled entirely in a raised wooden aqueduct.  wheal emma leat, 2017, by ignacio acosta.  engine house, 2017, by ignacio acosta.  then buildings fall into decay where ivy and tree growth have taken hold. the silted channel follows the contour round hills and combes using the best-fit method to wheal emma sett. whereas conifer scrub and dense patches of rhododendron are seen quite late in the sequence. all 99 stations were used and having passed over the wheel water may have been diverted.  the long wheelhouse sides are not straight but slightly kinked to provide for a dished 60-ft wheel over an arched tailrace exit at floor level. in this same evening were those people engaged to feast on roast beef and strong ale nearby. within the valley of the holy brook the mines are situated near buckfastleigh, crushed ores are hauled for the south wales copper smelters, alfred jenkin their agent in cornwall.  over and over had they been in the heaven of expectation finding the ore ground pitched eastward; those who gambled their lives in swift currents and dark treacherous pools. granting two properties as one sett at a royalty of 1/24 together with fine machinery, wheels, a beam engine, and water privileges. one hundred and twenty- five workers being then separated only by a small transverse valley.  the flat rods moved off so quietly that those not looking were unconscious of their being in motion. steam was employed only at limited scale. emma, 116 fathoms below adit, pumping backed-up water for life itself: men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air or crushing with hand tools, spalling, cobbing, came our tramroad to harbor direct in totnes and thence by sea to neath — no more windlass or horse-whim turning. what you see here is the dressing floor.  their phoenician purple dye — their copper with fifteen percent cornish tin. remember when a solid solution of metal elements was defined by ecstatic bonding. water poured over its surface producing hydrogen gas. the new material is stable and ready for use but scaled-up production could fuel cannibal drones.  tailrace, 2017, by ignacio acosta.  green pool, 2017, by ignacio acosta.  we love the color and the stillness. nothing would live in this water now at the base of a spoil heap two stories high. worm casts and broadly scattered pits are laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. this is the green pool: a water soak away made from glass epoxy.  they are brown and green like uneven flat loaves and the museum label reads tortas de cobre . moss grows on anything like black flame retardant mechanically supports and electrically connects — the fenced-off shaft protecting the river from what leaches out between sea-borne traders.  at these horizons the levels were extended over 330 fathoms. small groups of self-employed miners and their families continued to migrate. here was alluvial gold mixed with sand and gravel, producing more than 14 heads of stamps were capable of crushing. composed of quartz, peach, and gossan with black and yellow copper letting down a stream of mineralized water.  for in much of this section the leat had been cut from solid rock. a stone-lined sluice is just visible. 4,000 shares on the cost book system, streamworks in eluvial ground, 5 shillings each deposit. nothing but a washing strake such as we use, commodified and priced both minerals since the bronze age in west devon, in cornwall beneath a layer of black sand.  an adit is also brought home to the spot from below: narrow tailings in steep profile cast every shovel full as it rises into a tye. £40,000 worth of copper ore from above the 50-fathom level. water breaks up the soil, exposing mere threads of land, linear strips cut into channels called races dug across the ground to be worked, removing the overburden.

 when in wisconsin where i once had time the flyway swans came whistling to the rotten green bay ice and stayed, not feeding, four days, maybe five, i shouted  and threw stones to see them fly. blue herons followed, or came first. i shot a bittern’s wing off with my gun. for that my wife could cry.  my neighbor’s wife mistook the spawning frogs for wood ducks nesting the white pines up on bean hill: i straightway set her right. each april, on the first  rainy night i lantern-hunt for salamanders where they hide, toewalking the bottom mucks and muds. i shudder at the scored skin of their sides, the deep  flesh tucks. in hand, they dry. i walk in frogspawn jellies on my lawns. one time i hoped the great white birds might brake for the frog ditch and alight,  but all the addled past falls in on itself, splash rings close inward on the rising stone, my gun sucks fire, the bone becomes whole bone, light narrows back  on point and filament, the forest turns to sand, and only season lacking source rolls round and round, till i in my turns fall forever back clutching my stone, my gun, my light.  when in wisconsin where i once had time and spring beasts gorged my marrows and my tongue, i was not blind: the red eft clambered in my eye.

 underneath ice caps, once glacial peaks deer, elk, vixen begin to ascend. free creatures camouflaged as waves and waves receding far  from plains pulling  upward slopes and faraway snow dusted mountains. on spotted and clear cut hills robbed of fir, high above wheat tapestried valleys, flood plains up where headwaters reside.  droplets pound, listen.  hoofed and pawed mammals pawing and hoofing themselves up, up. along rivers dammed by chocolate beavers, trailed by salamanders—mud puppies.  plunging through currents, above concrete and steel man-made barriers  these populations of plains, prairies, forests flee in such frenzy, popping splash dance, pillaging cattail zones, lashing lily pads— the breath of life in muddy ponds, still lakes.  liquid beads slide on windshield glass  along cracked and shattered pane, spider-like with webs and prisms. “look, there, the rainbow touched the ground both ends down!”  full arch seven colors showered, heed what indigenous know, why long ago, they said no one belongs here, surrounding them, that this land was meant to be wet with waters of nearby not fertile to crops and domestic graze.  the old ones said,  “when the animals leave this place the waters will come again. this power is beyond the strength of man. the river will return with its greatest force.”  no one can stop her. she was meant to be this way. snakes in honor, do not intrude.  the rainbow tied with red and green like that on petal rose, though only momentarily. colors disappear like print photographs fade. they mix with charcoal surrounding.  a flurry of fowl follow  like strands, maidenhair falls, from blackened clouds above swarming inward covering the basin and raising sky.  darkness hangs over  the hills appear as black water crests, blackness varying shades. the sun is somewhere farther than the farthest ridge . main gravel crossroads and back back roads  slicken to mud, clay. turtles creep along rising banks, snapping jowls.  frogs chug throaty songs. the frogs only part of immense choir heralding the downpour, the falling oceans. over the train trestle, suspension bridge with  current so slick everything slides off in sheets.  among rotten stumps in black bass ponds, somewhere catfish reel in fins and crawl, walking whiskers to higher waters. waters above, below  the choir calling it forth.  brightly plumed jays and dull brown-headed cowbirds fly as if hung in one place like pinwheels. they dance toward the rain crest, the approaching storm  beckoning, inviting, summoning.  a single sparrow sings the stroke of rain past the strength of sunlight. the frog chorus sings refrain, melody drumming thunder,  evoked by beasts and water creatures wanting their homes. wanting to return to clearings and streams where ash, or white birch woods rise,    tower over, quaking aspen stand against storm shown veils—sheeting rains crossing  pasture, meadow, hills, mountain. sounds erupt. gathering clouds converge, push, pull, push, pull forcing lightning  back and forth shaping windy, sculptured swans, mallard ducks, and giants from stratocumulus media. as if they are a living cloud chamber, as if they exist only in the heavens.  air swells with dampness. it has begun.

 at five i wake, rise, rub on the smoking pane a port to see—water breathing in the air, boughs broken. the sun comes up in a golden stain, floats like a glassy sea-fruit. there is mist everywhere, white and humid, and the harbour is like plated stone, dull flakes of ice. one light drips out alone, one bead of winter-red, smouldering in the steam, quietly over the roof-tops—another window touched with a crystal fire in the sun’s gullies, one lonely star of the morning, where no stars gleam.  far away on the rim of this great misty cup, the sun gilds the dead suburbs as he rises up, diamonds the wind-cocks, makes glitter the crusted spikes on moss-drowned gables. now the tiles drip scarlet-wet, swim like birds’ paving-stones, and sunlight strikes their watery mirrors with a moister rivulet, acid and cold. here lie those mummied kings, men sleeping in houses, embalmed in stony coffins, till the last trumpet calls their galleries up, and the suburbs rise with distant murmurings.  o buried dolls, o men sleeping invisible there, i stare above your mounds of stone, lean down, marooned and lonely in this bitter air, and in one moment deny your frozen town, renounce your bodies—earth falls in clouds away, stones lose their meaning, substance is lost in clay, roofs fade, and that small smoking forgotten heap, the city, dissolves to a shell of bricks and paper, empty, without purpose, a thing not comprehended, a broken tomb, where ghosts unknown sleep.  and the least crystal weed, shaken with frost, the furred herbs of silver, the daisies round-eyed and tart, painted in antic china, the smallest night-flower tossed like a bright penny on the lawn, stirs more my heart, strikes deeper this morning air, than mortal towers dried to a common blindness, fainter than flowers, fordone, extinguished, as the vapours break, and dead in the dawn. o sun that kills with life, and brings to breath all silent things—o dawn, waken me with old earth, keep me awake!

 across north wales the snowflakes wander, a swarm of white bees. over the woods a cold veil lies. a load of chalk bows down the trees.  no undergrowth without its wool, no field unsheeted; no path is left through any field; on every stump white flour is milled.  will someone tell me what angels lift planks in the flour-loft floor of heaven shaking down dust? an angel’s cloak is cold quicksilver.  and here below the big drifts blow, blow and billow across the heather like swollen bellies. the frozen foam falls in fleeces.  out of my house i will not stir for any girl to have my coat look like a miller’s or stuck with feathers of eider down.  what a great fall lies on my country! a wide wall, stretching one sea to the other, greater and graver than the sea’s graveyard. when will rain come?  
NEW POEM
 colonel cold strode up the line  (tabs of rime and spurs of ice);  stiffened all that met his glare:  horses, men and lice.   visited a forward post,  left them burning, ear to foot;  fingers stuck to biting steel,  toes to frozen boot.   stalked on into no man’s land,  turned the wire to fleecy wool,  iron stakes to sugar sticks  snapping at a pull.   those who watched with hoary eyes  saw two figures gleaming there;  hauptmann kälte, colonel old,  gaunt in the grey air.   stiffly, tinkling spurs they moved,  glassy-eyed, with glinting heel  stabbing those who lingered there  torn by screaming steel.  
NEW POEM
 1 but i was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer. exhausted, you lay your head on the kitchen table and said: “but what’s the difference between a monster and a cyborg? i need something to eat. do you have any chocolate?” opening the fridge, i said quietly and perhaps too seriously, trying to impress you: “the monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances.” her fate. her body. great britain. you said: “so, is laloo english or british?” i said: “she’s from london.” but the more i said london, the more it sounded like a joke. londonlondonlondon.  2 i was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car. this is something you can only do here. wish for something. did you ever do it? wish you weren’t there? i want that go on, go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the panama canal or idaho. hitchhiking in idaho as a veritable child, i was taken in by a farming couple, fatty and daddy, a hundred miles or so outside of boise. fatty was rail thin, about seventy-five, and daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife. they picked me up in their truck—i was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers—and i stayed with them for five days. they said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that, and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called country buffet. in my innocence, i had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a kkk leader/operative, charles reynold. what is an operative? it is someone who is always planning a way in, like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red, bushy tail. daddy, fatty, and i hunkered down until daddy’s nephew, robert, stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to boise proper, where there was a bus station. i waited until robert had gone and then i walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers. “i can take you as far as the state line.” “that would be lovely.” obsessed, far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at heathrow airport or nestle, the main employers in the dingy part of northwest london that constituted my origins, i said yes. soft yes to the color green, which is going.  3 that is a tree (going) but also an ocean: a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me; for you it might happen in another place. mine. like laloo, i lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows. thus, a juniper tree flying by the window, intensely blue, or the atlantic ocean, to the left, if the car has a destination to the south, such as to the keys, is magical to me. improbable in light of my origins. hers. the girl in the car. i don’t know. i am writing to you, in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it (the dress, the morning of writing ahead of you) is a café; as if, writing, you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself. for this reason, when i think of you reading, i think of you as writing blindly. you read but you are also writing. as if my own eyes were closed, i see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl. these books are separate from my own work, here in the salt-water notebook, but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense. like birds.  4 this is pre but the notebook is after. soaked already at the edge and foamy. past future. writing on the warp when dry. pages. entries by hand. that is the morning i woke up and walked to the pacific ocean, after a night in a motel in florence, oregon, complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows. the woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it. an expatriate, she said exaggeratedly, oblivious to our common origin: “about four miles. you’re not going to walk, are you? do you have an umbrella? you can’t go out like that, ducky.”  5 i walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day, the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up, on its forested, proximal verge by gorse, which is a bright yellow flower. citron-yellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it. the day. like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain. monsoon. what kind of rain is this? i recognized the immensity but not the temperature. this was monstrous: the inability to assimilate, on the level of the senses, an ordinary experience of weather. here is the tongue, for example, constantly darting out to feel the air: what is it? is it summer? is it a different season? it’s a different day. that’s okay. damaged from her travels, in some sense unsettled, enormously anxious, a girl does it anway: gets up and goes. it’s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around.

 i wish them cramps. i wish them a strange town and the last tampon. i wish them no 7-11.  i wish them one week early and wearing a white skirt. i wish them one week late.  later i wish them hot flashes and clots like you wouldn't believe. let the flashes come when they meet someone special. let the clots come when they want to.  let them think they have accepted arrogance in the universe, then bring them to gynecologists not unlike themselves.  
NEW POEM
 it wouldn't kill me to find new frequencies in a temper tantrum.  tatamis and memory, magnetized selves becoming heavy.  of what is a scream composed? you may want to know.  you may want to know why.  it is to these arabesques that the birdsong replies.  copula, disappear. anguish, multifoliate. i am a brother to a wandering prayer.  orb in ruined loop fluting for a lost future.  i grab what is left of pistons bouncing across a street.  the barricade is foolproof.  
NEW POEM
 a wolf is at the laundromat, it's not a wary stare-wolf, it's short and fat, it tips its hat, unlike a scary glare-wolf.  it combs its hair, it clips its toes, it is a fairly rare wolf, that's only there to clean its clothes— it is a wash-and-wear-wolf.  
NEW POEM
 they listen to the myna birds dicker in the grass. the child’s blue shoes are caked with garden dirt. when he runs, she sees the antics of a pair of wrens. she works the garden,  a pot of rusting gardenias has given off its ales and infused the danker germinations of her grief. she watches her son chase pigeons, kick at the leaves piled high. now, a magpie  adds to his cascades of laughter as he runs with the hose, pours a fine spray, happy to be giving to the grass this silver courtship. she sighs, watches the drops settle in. today, who  can explain the sadness she feels. surely this day is to be treasured: the sun out, the breeze like a cat’s tongue licking a moon of milk; her son expending himself in small, public  bursts, happy among clover where bees hover, and unfold centrefolds of nectar. today, who can explain the heaviness in her head, as if all her worries were tomes toward a larger work,  one she knows she will never finish, but to which she must keep adding, thought by thought. she sweeps the petals, smells their russet imprint. soon dusk will come with an envoy of smoke  and her son outlast her patience by a rose. already he is tiring, puling at the flowers. it won’t be long before they’ll go in, listen to the jug purr comfort. he’ll sleep and she’ll  lie back, or get up to unhook the cry of her cat from the wire door. now, a few cicadas are idling, giving each other the gun and a cockatoo calls, a haughty felon. she sighs, knowing she won’t  escape her mood today, the turned earth or its rank persuasions; her child’s petulance flaring like an orchid, or a cockatoo’s unruly crest. today, she knows she will need to consider  her unhappiness, of what she is a prisoner – if not the loss of hope’s particulars. her son soaks the path, rinses the sky of its featureless blue. he is giving that water, now, to everything.  
NEW POEM
 in the ocean one fish swallows the other: a geometric progression of loss. you are bigger than i. the calamity of love swelling out larger than us. and what destiny partakes of our dilemma? swallows the cause and effect: eyes and kissing mouths and enlarged parts wanting to breathe and wanting.  there is no gentle sense to this. is there? only a kind of terror at the chain of events, the scale of loss, the ordered  destruction one against the other— all that something larger awaits its moment.  
NEW POEM
 for maxine kumin a cylinder of maple set in place, feet spread apart— and the heavy maul, fat as a hammer but honed like an axe, draws a semicircle overhead and strikes through the two new halves to leave the steel head sunk a half-inch in the block and the ash handle rigid in the air. a smack of the palm, gripping as it hits the butt end, and the blade rolls out of the cut. the half-logs are still rocking on the flagstones.  so much less than what we have been persuaded to dream, this necessity for wood might have sufficed, but it is what we have been taught to disown and forget. yet just such hardship is what saves. for if the stacked cords speak of felled trees, of countless five-foot logs flipped end over end downhill till the blood is wrung from your back and snowbound warmth must seem so far off you would rather freeze,  yet each thin tongue torn from the grain when log-halves were sundered at one stroke will sing in the stove. to remind you of hands. of how mere touch is song in the silence where hands live—the song of muddy bark, the song of sawdust like cornmeal and down, and the song of one hand over another, two of us holding the last length of the log in the sawbuck as inches away the chainsaw keeps ripping through hickory.

 the word comes along out of the mountain every once in awhile to chill me.  undercurrent of an unwillingness to believe all  is well in early spring beside a molten river riven by sun,  its loud hush and glug through leafless aspens split by a gravel bar’s pulled switch.  a bull trout with fluorescent red dorsal fin eddies in a pool  between a sloughed-off root clump and caved-in grassy bank.  last year’s downed trees, slash piles, busted garden gate.  heed me and hear my loneliness. split by a desire to be known  by a crowd of solitaires and by one word split.  a raven falls out of the yellow flame of a willow.  its wings purely black buff sunlight.  it paces the gravel bar, lifts into westerly sun.  wing flash. black luster. gone.  it is hope that tricks. belief that when this now shines,  this now shines with or without us. then why  scribble the veery’s mid-morning marshal song?  soon rick will arrive to help burn wood piles:  gasoline newspaper cedar shakes to start the blaze  in this emptiness searching for godwords.  the ones god hears when priests without shoes  without socks with their shawls stretched over their heads  arms out make forts of light. their backs to the congregation,  their faces toward the ark, they rock.  their white wings so pure that this now is no more than then  with its barbells of silence, with its task of burning.  
NEW POEM
 the moon swells and its yellow darkens nearer the horizon and soon all the aluminum rooftops  shall appear, orange and distinct beside the orange sun, while the diamond flares in its vacuum  within. it is simple to be with the shovel, thoughtless, inhabited by this divorce, it is good  the luminous machinery, silenced, waits, nice that the conveyor belts choked with sand  convey nothing. when i return home to coffee at 7:45 the lithe young girls will be going to high school, pulling  to their mouths stark cigarettes through arizona’s sunlight. these last few months have been awful, and when  around five the roosters alone on neighboring small farms begin to scream like humans my heart just lies down, a stone.

 the world below the brine, forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves, sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle, openings, and pink turf, different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the play of light through the water, dumb swimmers there among the rocks, coral, gluten, grass, rushes, and the aliment of the swimmers, sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling close to the bottom, the sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting with his flukes, the leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard, and the sting-ray, passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths, breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do, the change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere, the change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.

 what over the gable-end and high up under tangled cloud that raven might be saying to its tumble-soaring mate or what the blackbird might intend when chattering among scattered breadcrumbs or what the bellowing of one cow then another in the near field might mean remains beyond my ken—being all noise for which no words will manage though all is language settling and unsettling the world beyond me . . . and yet there’s the dunnock in all its dun colours at work among the small stones and patchy grass of the driveway and here’s the robin’s aggressive tilt at breadcrumbs and there goes the sudden shriek of the blackbird . . . all alive inside the inhuman breath-pattern of the wind trawling every last leaf and blade of grass and flinging rain like velvet pebbles onto the skylight: nothing but parables in every bristling inch of the out-of-sight unspoken never-to-be-known pure sense-startling untranslatable there of the world as we find it.

 5 am .  one-quarter past. distant chimes inform me this.  a bell peal knells the mist. and sunlight’s  not yet bludgeoning. but some light gets blood going.  last night it was snowing and now  every path’s a pall. though mine the only footfalls  at this hour of awe. above hangs a canopy of needle leaf.  below, the season’s mean deceit—  that everything stays white and clean.  it doesn’t, of course, but i wish it. my prayers  are green with this intent, imploring winter wrens  to trill and begging scuttling bucks come back.  there’s something that i lack. a wryneck  bullet-beaks a branch. his woodworm didn’t have a chance.  what i miss, i’ve never had.  but i am not a ghost. i am a guest.  and life is thirst, at best.  so do not strike me, heart. i am, too, tinder.  i’m flammable as birch bark, even damp.  blue spruce, bee-eater— be sweeter to me.  let larksong shudder to its january wheeze,  but gift these hands a happiness just once.  it is half passed. and i am cold.  another peal has tolled. i’ve told the sum of my appeals.  i need not watch for fox. they do not congregate at dawn.  but i would, were i one.

 to the happy memory of five franciscan nuns, exiles by the falk laws, drowned between midnight and morning of dec. 7th, 1875 i thou mastering me god! giver of breath and bread; world's strand, sway of the sea; lord of living and dead; thou hast bound bones &amp; veins in me, fastened me flesh, and after it almost unmade, what with dread, thy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh? over again i feel thy finger and find thee.  i did say yes o at lightning and lashed rod; thou heardst me truer than tongue confess thy terror, o christ, o god; thou knowest the walls, altar and hour and night: the swoon of a heart that the sweep and the hurl of thee trod hard down with a horror of height: and the midriff astrain with leaning of, laced with fire of stress.  the frown of his face before me, the hurtle of hell behind, where, where was a, where was a place? i whirled out wings that spell and fled with a fling of the heart to the heart of the host. my heart, but you were dovewinged, i can tell, carrier-witted, i am bold to boast, to flash from the flame to the flame then, tower from the grace to the grace.  i am soft sift in an hourglass—at the wall fast, but mined with a motion, a drift, and it crowds and it combs to the fall; i steady as a water in a well, to a poise, to a pane, but roped with, always, all the way down from the tall fells or flanks of the voel, a vein of the gospel proffer, a pressure, a principle, christ's gift.  i kiss my hand to the stars, lovely-asunder starlight, wafting him out of it; and glow, glory in thunder; kiss my hand to the dappled-with-damson west: since, tho' he is under the world's splendour and wonder, his mystery must be instressed, stressed; for i greet him the days i meet him, and bless when i understand.  not out of his bliss springs the stress felt nor first from heaven (and few know this) swings the stroke dealt— stroke and a stress that stars and storms deliver, that guilt is hushed by, hearts are flushed by and melt— but it rides time like riding a river (and here the faithful waver, the faithless fable and miss).  it dates from day of his going in galilee; warm-laid grave of a womb-life grey; manger, maiden's knee; the dense and the driven passion, and frightful sweat; thence the discharge of it, there its swelling to be, though felt before, though in high flood yet— what none would have known of it, only the heart, being hard at bay,  is out with it! oh, we lash with the best or worst word last! how a lush-kept plush-capped sloe will, mouthed to flesh-burst, gush!—flush the man, the being with it, sour or sweet, brim, in a flash, full!—hither then, last or first, to hero of calvary, christ,'s feet— never ask if meaning it, wanting it, warned of it—men go.  be adored among men, god, three-numberéd form; wring thy rebel, dogged in den, man's malice, with wrecking and storm. beyond saying sweet, past telling of tongue, thou art lightning and love, i found it, a winter and warm; father and fondler of heart thou hast wrung: hast thy dark descending and most art merciful then.  with an anvil-ding and with fire in him forge thy will or rather, rather then, stealing as spring through him, melt him but master him still: whether at once, as once at a crash paul, or as austin, a lingering-out swéet skíll, make mercy in all of us, out of us all mastery, but be adored, but be adored king.  ii  "some find me a sword; some the flange and the rail; flame, fang, or flood" goes death on drum, and storms bugle his fame. but wé dréam we are rooted in earth—dust! flesh falls within sight of us, we, though our flower the same, wave with the meadow, forget that there must the sour scythe cringe, and the blear share come.  on saturday sailed from bremen, american-outward-bound, take settler and seamen, tell men with women, two hundred souls in the round— o father, not under thy feathers nor ever as guessing the goal was a shoal, of a fourth the doom to be drowned; yet did the dark side of the bay of thy blessing not vault them, the million of rounds of thy mercy not reeve even them in?  into the snows she sweeps, hurling the haven behind, the deutschland, on sunday; and so the sky keeps, for the infinite air is unkind, and the sea flint-flake, black-backed in the regular blow, sitting eastnortheast, in cursed quarter, the wind; wiry and white-fiery and whirlwind-swivellèd snow spins to the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps.  she drove in the dark to leeward, she struck—not a reef or a rock but the combs of a smother of sand: night drew her dead to the kentish knock; and she beat the bank down with her bows and the ride of her keel: the breakers rolled on her beam with ruinous shock; and canvass and compass, the whorl and the wheel idle for ever to waft her or wind her with, these she endured.  hope had grown grey hairs, hope had mourning on, trenched with tears, carved with cares, hope was twelve hours gone; and frightful a nightfall folded rueful a day nor rescue, only rocket and lightship, shone, and lives at last were washing away: to the shrouds they took,—they shook in the hurling and horrible airs.  one stirred from the rigging to save the wild woman-kind below, with a rope's end round the man, handy and brave— he was pitched to his death at a blow, for all his dreadnought breast and braids of thew: they could tell him for hours, dandled the to and fro through the cobbled foam-fleece, what could he do with the burl of the fountains of air, buck and the flood of the wave?  they fought with god's cold— and they could not and fell to the deck (crushed them) or water (and drowned them) or rolled with the sea-romp over the wreck. night roared, with the heart-break hearing a heart-broke rabble, the woman's wailing, the crying of child without check— till a lioness arose breasting the babble, a prophetess towered in the tumult, a virginal tongue told.  ah, touched in your bower of bone are you! turned for an exquisite smart, have you! make words break from me here all alone, do you!—mother of being in me, heart. o unteachably after evil, but uttering truth, why, tears! is it? tears; such a melting, a madrigal start! never-eldering revel and river of youth, what can it be, this glee? the good you have there of your own?  sister, a sister calling a master, her master and mine!— and the inboard seas run swirling and hawling; the rash smart sloggering brine blinds her; but she that weather sees one thing, one; has one fetch in her: she rears herself to divine ears, and the call of the tall nun to the men in the tops and the tackle rode over the storm's brawling.  she was first of a five and came of a coifèd sisterhood. (o deutschland, double a desperate name! o world wide of its good! but gertrude, lily, and luther, are two of a town, christ's lily and beast of the waste wood: from life's dawn it is drawn down, abel is cain's brother and breasts they have sucked the same.)  loathed for a love men knew in them, banned by the land of their birth, rhine refused them, thames would ruin them; surf, snow, river and earth gnashed: but thou art above, thou orion of light; thy unchancelling poising palms were weighing the worth, thou martyr-master: in thy sight storm flakes were scroll-leaved flowers, lily showers—sweet heaven was astrew in them.  five! the finding and sake and cipher of suffering christ. mark, the mark is of man's make and the word of it sacrificed. but he scores it in scarlet himself on his own bespoken, before-time-taken, dearest prizèd and priced— stigma, signal, cinquefoil token for lettering of the lamb's fleece, ruddying of the rose-flake.  joy fall to thee, father francis, drawn to the life that died; with the gnarls of the nails in thee, niche of the lance, his lovescape crucified and seal of his seraph-arrival! and these thy daughters and five-livèd and leavèd favour and pride, are sisterly sealed in wild waters, to bathe in his fall-gold mercies, to breathe in his all-fire glances.  away in the loveable west, on a pastoral forehead of wales, i was under a roof here, i was at rest, and they the prey of the gales; she to the black-about air, to the breaker, the thickly falling flakes, to the throng that catches and quails was calling "o christ, christ, come quickly": the cross to her she calls christ to her, christens her wildworst best.  the majesty! what did she mean? breathe, arch and original breath. is it love in her of the being as her lover had been? breathe, body of lovely death. they were else-minded then, altogether, the men woke thee with a we are perishing in the weather of gennesareth. or ís it that she cried for the crown then, the keener to come at the comfort for feeling the combating keen?  for how to the heart's cheering the down-dugged ground-hugged grey hovers off, the jay-blue heavens appearing of pied and peeled may! blue-beating and hoary-glow height; or night, still higher, with belled fire and the moth-soft milky way, what by your measure is the heaven of desire, the treasure never eyesight got, nor was ever guessed what for the hearing?  no, but it was not these. the jading and jar of the cart, time's tasking, it is fathers that asking for ease of the sodden-with-its-sorrowing heart, not danger, electrical horror; then further it finds the appealing of the passion is tenderer in prayer apart: other, i gather, in measure her mind's burden, in wind's burly and beat of endragonèd seas.  but how shall i . . . make me room there: reach me a ... fancy, come faster— strike you the sight of it? look at it loom there, thing that she ... there then! the master, ipse , the only one, christ, king, head: he was to cure the extremity where he had cast her; do, deal, lord it with living and dead; let him ride, her pride, in his triumph, despatch and have done with his doom there.  ah! there was a heart right there was single eye! read the unshapeable shock night and knew the who and the why; wording it how but by him that present and past, heaven and earth are word of, worded by?— the simon peter of a soul! to the blast tarpeian-fast, but a blown beacon of light.  jesu, heart's light, jesu, maid's son, what was the feast followed the night thou hadst glory of this nun?— feast of the one woman without stain. for so conceivèd, so to conceive thee is done; but here was heart-throe, birth of a brain, word, that heard and kept thee and uttered thee outright.  well, she has thee for the pain, for the patience; but pity of the rest of them! heart, go and bleed at a bitterer vein for the comfortless unconfessed of them— no not uncomforted: lovely-felicitous providence finger of a tender of, o of a feathery delicacy, the breast of the maiden could obey so, be a bell to, ring of it, and startle the poor sheep back! is the shipwrack then a harvest, does tempest carry the grain for thee?  i admire thee, master of the tides, of the yore-flood, of the year's fall; the recurb and the recovery of the gulf's sides, the girth of it and the wharf of it and the wall; staunching, quenching ocean of a motionable mind; ground of being, and granite of it: past all grasp god, throned behind death with a sovereignty that heeds but hides, bodes but abides;  with a mercy that outrides the all of water, an ark for the listener; for the lingerer with a love glides lower than death and the dark; a vein for the visiting of the past-prayer, pent in prison, the-last-breath penitent spirits—the uttermost mark our passion-plungèd giant risen, the christ of the father compassionate, fetched in the storm of his strides.  now burn, new born to the world, doubled-naturèd name, the heaven-flung, heart-fleshed, maiden-furled miracle-in-mary-of-flame, mid-numbered he in three of the thunder-throne! not a dooms-day dazzle in his coming nor dark as he came; kind, but royally reclaiming his own; a released shower, let flash to the shire, not a lightning of fíre hard-hurled.  dame, at our door drowned, and among our shoals, remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the reward: our kíng back, oh, upon énglish sóuls! let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us, be a crimson-cresseted east, more brightening her, rare-dear britain, as his reign rolls, pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest, our hearts' charity's hearth's fire, our thoughts' chivalry's throng's lord.

 just by the wooden brig a bird flew up, frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down to reach the misty dewberry—let us stoop and seek its nest—the brook we need not dread, 'tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown, so it sings harmless o'er its pebbly bed —ay here it is, stuck close beside the bank beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank its husk seeds tall and high—'tis rudely planned of bleachèd stubbles and the withered fare that last year's harvest left upon the land, lined thinly with the horse's sable hair. five eggs, pen-scribbled o'er with ink their shells resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads as nature's poesy and pastoral spells— they are the yellowhammer's and she dwells most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds as sweet as castaly to fancy seems and that old molehill like as parnass' hill on which her partner haply sits and dreams o'er all her joys of song—so leave it still a happy home of sunshine, flowers and streams. yet in the sweetest places cometh ill, a noisome weed that burthens every soil; for snakes are known with chill and deadly coil to watch such nests and seize the helpless young, and like as though the plague became a guest, leaving a houseless home, a ruined nest— and mournful hath the little warblers sung when such like woes hath rent its little breast.

 your idea of embracing horror was overwhelmed by the horror:  in the mild milkiness of the afternoon, on the bluff that commands a vision of bank towers knifing up far higher than the rising, empty shell of the moon ... on the height where you stand and still can't understand your life as anything but slow dying, your time seeps out as into a warm bath, the way the exemplary career of petronius the just—pornographer and satirist- once leaked away.
